          "title": "Stronger measures required to halt arms influx",
          "text": "NIGERIA is awash with illicit arms. From the daily assault of amply armed terrorists and criminals around the country to frequent arms seizures by security personnel, the reality of a society buckling under the threat of guns is palpable. The recent seizure of a container with arms hidden among used clothes at the Tin Can Island Port in Lagos reinforces this. Urgently, the Federal Government needs to devise and implement stronger, effective policies to halt the importation, fabrication, trade, and possession of illegal arms.\n\nThe foiled attempt to smuggle illicit weapons into the country demonstrates that the deluge is still on and thriving and that the security agencies and the Nigeria Customs Service especially, have yet to formulate measures to stop the influx through the ports and illegal entry points into the country.\n\nAlthough the interception netted a relatively small cache \u2013 one Smith & Wesson pistol; 100 pieces of 9mm ammunition; 200 pieces of 70mm ammunition, and two empty magazines \u2013 the capacity of smugglers to beat almost all the rail guards is scary. The dangerous contraband was concealed among used clothes, and the container included cars, television sets and other goods. It is embarrassing that after many past seizures confirming the Tin Can Port as a major entry point for illicit arms import, the arms smuggling rings and their barons have not been smashed or exposed. The President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), should appreciate the enormity of the problem, and devise a strategy and task force to rid the country of illicit arms.\n\nThe volume of illicit weapons in Nigeria is frightening, a vivid image of Nigeria\u2019s weak security system, fuelled by corruption, laxity, hollow institutions, and absence of adequate punishment for the traffickers. The 2016 United Nations\u2019 report saying that Nigeria accounted for 350 million out of the 500 million illegal arms in West Africa is out of date. A revelation by the police that 1,887 weapons were recovered between January and December 2021 is undoubtedly a mere drop in the ocean.\n\nThe availability of arms in the hands of non-state actors has helped to tip the country to the edge of state failure. Generously armed, criminals and terrorists sometimes overwhelm police and military units with superior firepower. In July, bandits/terrorists brought down a Nigeria Air Force Alpha jet in Zamfara State. In Borno State, Boko Haram/ISWAP Islamic terrorists have fired rockets into the fortified state capital, Maiduguri. Fulani herdsmen have reportedly added machine guns to their arsenal.\n\nThe influx of arms from crisis-ridden West, Central and North African nations and through the seaports, and the country\u2019s porous borders, said the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, is fuelling the terrorism, kidnapping and wanton killings across Nigeria. The US National Security Council observed that developing countries like Nigeria with weak rule of law are particularly susceptible to such penetration of transnational crime. Stopping the deluge should be a top priority, backed with effective implementation of existing and new measures.\n\nIn January 2017, 661 pump-action rifles already cleared at the Lagos port were later intercepted. Another 440 assorted firearms were seized at the same port in May of that year, and 470 pump-action rifles were also seized just four months after. Figures of the quantum of arms smuggled through the porous land borders daily are not known. Evidence of the magnitude is however seen in the humongous quantity recovered from criminals and traffickers by security agents across the country. No doubt, the NCS has demonstrated laxity, while the intelligence agencies devote more energy to suppressing self-determination activism and regime critics than stopping arms trafficking.\n\nThe UNODC says, \u201cThe availability of weapons interacts with illegal oil bunkering, endemic corruption, high youth unemployment and social disintegration to produce a highly dangerous mix.\u201d Global Initiative\u2019s Global Organised Crime Index 2021 ranks Nigeria as the second in Africa, and fifth globally among countries with the highest pervasive criminality scores.\n\nTo be fair, the government has fashioned several responses to the illicit weapons threat. In September, Buhari transmitted two additional executive bills to the National Assembly to control the proliferation and regulate the importation of explosives. Earlier in July, both chambers of the parliament had separately voted amendments to the Firearms Act, imposing three to 10 years imprisonment and stiff fines for illegal possession and trafficking in arms offences. Also in May, Buhari approved the replacement of the Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons with the National Centre for Small Arms and Light Weapons. Domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser, it will coordinate, \u201cprovide guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of SALW in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut the required vigour and bite are missing. With full presidential backing, the NSA should take effective charge of the measures to stop the influx. There should be full cooperation among the various agencies, the NCS, the Police, National Intelligence Agency, State Security Service, Defence Intelligence Agency, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, the state and regional security outfits, and the Nigerian Immigration Service. Buhari should demonstrate zero tolerance for inter-agency rivalry and obstruction. Like elsewhere, agencies should deepen collaboration and seek greater assistance from foreign intelligence agencies. In March, the Canada Border Services Agency moved to create a joint Canada-US cross-border task force to combat gun smuggling and trafficking.\n\nThe police should have a task force to complement other initiatives. There should be established protocols for destroying seized illicit weapons to stop them from returning to the wrong hands.\n\nNigeria must urgently secure its borders by deploying modern technology, drones, helicopters, and light surveillance aeroplanes. Incompetent and corrupt officials should be held responsible for any laxity and flushed out.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no better time to devolve the policing system than now. Nigeria needs to decentralise the structure for effective policing. In the US, the police at all levels, including college campus police departments, are involved in tackling illicit arms. The deadly illicit influx should be stopped.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Sunday Igboho\n\nBy Sola Isola\n\nIlana Omo Oodua (IOO), the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups has said it was wrong for its counsel, Mr Pelumi Olajengbesi to annouce his resignation through social media since he wasn\u2019t hired through the Social media.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Communication Manager to the group Chairman, Maxwell Adeleye and made available to Vanguard in Ibadan on Sunday, the group noted that Olajengbesi\u2019s resignation is a contradiction and full of paradox.\n\nThe statement reads \u201cthe Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) Worldwide, the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups all over the world has received the media report of the resignation of Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi, the Lawyer that the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Groups worldwide retained and paid to defend the aides of Chief Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) against the Department of State Services (DSS) at an Abuja High Court.\n\n\u201cWe want to state very expressly that we did not hire Mr. Olajengbesi through the social media and it is not ideal for him to have resigned through the social media. Choosing the social media to resign is an indication of his lack of understanding of the ethics of his profession. It clearly raises questions on his integrity and honour.\n\n\u201cWe want the whole world to know that Mr. Olajengbesi resigned over the response of the Yoruba people worldwide to his provocative and unnecessary attack on social media against our revered leader, Professor Banji Akintoye on 31st December, 2021. The attack was over the statement of the renowned scholar declaring that there will be no Governorship Election in Ekiti and Osun States in 2022.\n\n\u201cOlajengbesi, in a conversation with IOO Directors of Legal Affairs and Communications, Barrister Olasupo Ojo and Mr. Maxwell Adeleye respectively, expressed regret of his action against Professor Banji Akintoye, stating that he had realised that he dabbled into an issue that does not concern him.\n\n\u201cHe agreed to make clarifications and apologise for misleading the public and misrepresenting the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Struggle. Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi admitted to us that he reacted too quickly to Prof. Banji Akintoye\u2019s statement, and that he was wrong, erred and thereby verbally apologized. This we accepted and called everyone concerned within the Homeland and Diaspora to stop releasing further statements against him forthwith.\n\n\u201cMr. Olajengbesi admitted that he was misled by The Punch Newspaper\u2019s \u201cambiguous\u201d report. He admitted that he hadn\u2019t read the full statement of Professor Banji Akintoye before he reacted through his Facebook timeline.\n\n\u201cWe therefore want to state that Mr. Olajengbesi\u2019s so-called social media resignation is full of contradictions and a paradox. He said he was quitting every case that has to do with Sunday Igboho and the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Struggle, at the same time he said he will continue with the case of the Ighoho2 charged for terrorism by the DSS.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t approbate and re-approbate. You can\u2019t be out attacking us on the social media and still want to handle the Ighoho2 case. You can\u2019t eat your cake and have it. The public embarrassment, humiliation and opprobrium that has been brought to the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Struggle by Olajengbesi in the last 24 hours is enough. With the way he has conducted himself in the last 24 hours, we are of the opinion that if allowed to continue with the Ighoho2 case, Pelumi Olajengbesi will sabotage us and trade the two innocent people to the Nigerian Government. We do not want him anywhere near our struggle anymore. He has clearly indicated that he lacks honour, integrity and decency.\n\n\u201cOlajengbesi fallaciosuly wrote a happy new year message on behalf of Sunday Adeyemo Igboho to President Muhammad Buhari without authorisation, impersonating and painting the image of a tired & surrendered Ighoho. When the statement of Professor Banji Akintoye on Ekiti and Osun State Elections overshadowed his Abuja-teleguided and self-serving statement, he got angry and went to the social media to attack Professor Banji Akintoye. He later confirmed to us on the phone that it was the DSS who sent him the Punch report of Professor Banji Akintoye\u2019s statement which prompted his social media virulence against our struggle.\n\n\u201cWhile Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi has a right to do whatever he likes in his personal capacity, we are however surprised that he could be wildly unethical in his professional approach by choosing to use social media to attack Professor Banji Akintoye\u2019s New Year Statement on behalf of the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Movement. We at Ilana Omo Oodua, being the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups, consider Olajengbesi\u2019s action as a betrayal of trust that we reposed in him and an abuse of the ethics of his legal profession. He took advantage of his association with our movement to perpetrate his personal agenda to our own detriment which is against the run of play.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi\u2019s fundamental human rights, the right as a Politician from Osun State and his strong interest in this year\u2019s Governorship Election in his home state for the 2023 general elections, a fraudulent process which Ilana Omo Oodua seeks the Instrumentalities of the law to stop, hence, his decision to attack Professor Banji Akintoye, not because he truly loves Chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho. CSI had before his arrest, made it clear to the world that it is #NoReferendumNoElection.\n\n\u201cLastly, it should be on record that contrary to the claim of Olajengbesi, he is not a personal lawyer to Sunday Igboho, but a Lawyer to the Yoruba Self-determination struggle. He was introduced to us by Chief Yomi Aliyu, SAN. The Self-Determination Struggle hired, retained and paid for the services of Pelumi Olajengbesi, not Chief Sunday Igboho. Olajengbesi, perhaps, looking for fame and popularity, used the media to brand himself as Ighoho\u2019s Lawyer. We chose to allow him to enjoy the fame to avoid distraction. Now having appropriated some fame, he turns to hobnobbing with the Nigerian Government to trade Chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho and our self-determination struggle for financial and political gains\u201d.\n\nOlajengbesi had earlier in the day announced his resignation as counsel involved in any matter relating to Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known Sunday Igboho and the Yoruba Nation Agitators.\n\nA statement personally signed by him states that \u201cas a firm, we are satisfied with our little best in contributing to providing legal solutions and representations to Chief Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) and associated Yoruba Nation Agitators as far as ensuring the protection and enforcement of their rights in this matter.\n\n\u201cWe were able to secure the release of twelve (12) persons brutally and unlawfully arrested by the reckless State Security Service (SSS), and also secured the release of an innocent herbalist unlawfully arrested and detained by the SSS.\n\n\u201cWe have two persons with on-going terrorism trials at the Federal High Court and our firm will dutifully continue and close the trial having commenced their matter.\n\n\u201cOlajengbesi thank everyone, particularly Chief Yomi Aliyu SAN for the opportunity, and freehand service, Dr. Olasupo Ojo for his fair leadership and Chief Femi Falana for allowing his industry to be tapped and for the moral support, I most respectfully wish to now step aside.\n\n\u201cI have stated ab initio that the scope of my work will only be within the purview of my professional duty as a lawyer to Sunday Igboho and his aides. I am a strong believer in constitutional democracy, civil liberty and human rights which includes the right to self-determination but I am not a Yoruba nation agitator nor a member of any like organization. My reaction to Prof. Akintoye was not to undermine the Yoruba struggle but is based off my personal convictions which I am entitled to. I do hope my friends in the struggle will allow me enjoy the benefit of my right to such a choice as a person of thought and conscience\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "\u201cWe want to state very expressly that we did not hire Mr. Olajengbesi through the social media and it is not ideal for him to have resigned through the social media.\nChoosing the social media to resign is an indication of his lack of understanding of the ethics of his profession.\n\u201cWe therefore want to state that Mr. Olajengbesi\u2019s so-called social media resignation is full of contradictions and a paradox.\nYou can\u2019t be out attacking us on the social media and still want to handle the Ighoho2 case.\nMy reaction to Prof. Akintoye was not to undermine the Yoruba struggle but is based off my personal convictions which I am entitled to.",

This is purely temporary in view of the recent spike in cases, and will be removed any moment the situation abates. It\u2019s a growing practice in government offices in many countries.\n\n\u201cAlthough some exceptions have been made for a few leaders in government coming from outside the Villa, they too are encouraged to do those tests.\n\n\u201cThis policy has rightfully been justified following the discovery of Covid positivity in some of those tested since the last few days of the practice.\u201d\n\nIt was fathered that some visitors that wanted to see the President at the Presidential Villa last week we\u2019re directed to take the covid-19 test before they were allowed to go in.\n\nAn unconfirmed report has it that even staff at the State House will be required to go for the Covid-19 test everyday before they would be allowed inside.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Why 1m COVID-19 vaccine doses expired, by health minister",
          "text": "By Kelvin Osa Okunbor, Oyebola Owolabi, Vincent Ikuomola, Frank Ikpefan, Moses Emorinken, Abuja\n\nMinister of Health Dr. Osagie Ehanire yesterday explained why one million doses of the donated COVID-19 vaccines given to Nigeria by some international donors expired and were eventual withdrawn from circulation.\n\nHe assured Nigerians that there were no expired COVID-19 vaccines in circulation, stating that vaccines expiration was not limited to Nigeria.\n\nEhanire stated these in Abuja while reacting to an online publication that nearly one million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had expired last month.\n\nThe minister stressed that the best way to end such occurrences would be for the country to begin the production of its own vaccines.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to data from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), as of December 6, about 7,244,620 of total eligible persons had received their first dose. The data added that 3,811,693 had received their second dose \u2013 fully vaccinated.\n\nEhanire said: \u201cThe attention of the Federal Ministry of Health has been drawn to reports circulating in the media to the effect that some Covid-19 vaccines had expired in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria has, of late, enjoyed the generosity of several, mainly European countries, who have offered us doses of COVID-19 vaccines out of their stockpiles, free of charge, through COVAX or AVAT facility. These donations are always acknowledged and thankfully received. However, some of them had residual shelf lives of only a few months that left us very short time, some just weeks, to use them, after deduction of time to transport, clear, distribute and deliver to users. If such vaccines arrive back-to-back or are many, logistic bottlenecks occasionally arise.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the kind gesture of donors, but also communicated the challenge of short shelf lives, whereupon some manufacturers offered to extend the vaccine shelf life after the fact, by 3 months, a practice that, though accepted by experts, is declined by the Federal Ministry of Health, because it is not accommodated in our standards. Nigeria does not dispense vaccines with a validity extended beyond labelled expiry date. We continue to adhere to our rigorous standards.\n\n\u201cDonation of surplus Covid-19 vaccines with expiring shelf lives to developing countries has been a matter of international discussion. Developing countries like Nigeria accept them because they close our critical vaccine supply gaps and, being free, save us scarce foreign exchange procurement costs. This dilemma is not typical to Nigeria, but a situation in which many low- and medium-income countries find themselves.\u201d\n\nEhanire added: \u201cNigeria has utilised most of the over 10 million short-shelf-life doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far supplied to us, in good time, and saved N16.4 billion or more than $40m in foreign exchange. The vaccines that expired had been withdrawn before then, and will be destroyed accordingly, by NAFDAC.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health shares its experience with partners regularly and now politely declines all vaccine donations with short shelf life or those that cannot be delivered in time.\u201d\n\nPfizer, BioNTech vaccine neutralises Omicron with three shots\n\nBioNTech and Pfizer (PFE.N) said yesterday that a three-shot course of their COVID-19 vaccine was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test and they could deliver an upgraded vaccine in March 2022, if needed.\n\nThe German and U.S. companies said two doses of their vaccine resulted in significantly lower neutralising antibodies, but a third dose boosted those antibodies by a factor of 25.\n\n\u201cThe first line of defence, with two doses of vaccination, might be compromised and three doses of vaccination are required to restore protection,\u201d BioNTech Chief Medical Officer Ozlem Tuereci said at a news conference.\n\nWorld\u2019s biggest vaccine maker slashes jab production by half\n\nThe world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer, India-based Serum Institute, plans to reduce production of the AstraZeneca jab against COVID-19 by at least half, its chief executive said in a television interview.\n\nSerum Institute head, Adar Poonawalla, said the failure of the Indian government to place any new orders was the reason for plans to slash production.\n\nAccording to Poonawalla, the orders from the UN vaccine initiative were coming in very slowly.\n\n\u201cI am going to be reducing the production by at least 50 per cent to begin with, going forward on a monthly basis, until the orders again pick up in India and the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company currently makes 250 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine every month.\n\nThe shot is sold in India under the name Covishield.\n\nSaudi Arabia bans flights from Nigeria\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has also shut its doors against Nigeria, following the report of the Coronavirus variant, Omicron, in the country.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian ban is coming three days after the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries imposed ban on flights from Nigeria.\n\nThe General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) in Saudi Arabia allegedly confirmed the development in a circular issued yesterday.\n\nThe circular was signed by Assistant President for Economic Policy and Air Transport, Dr. Faisal Al Sugair, titled: \u2018\u2019Suspension of flights from and to the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u2019\u2019 and directed to airlines operating in the airports of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe circular instructed the suspension of all incoming flights and entry to the Kingdom for non-nationals coming directly or indirectly from Nigeria, except for those who have spent a period of no less than 14 days in another country from which they are allowed to come.\n\nIt was gathered that the Holy Land also issued a new travel protocol.\n\nAccording to the circular, home quarantine will be applied for a period of five days to Saudi Arabia citizens coming from Nigeria, provided PCR examination on the first day and the fifth day regardless of immunisation status.\n\nAU, IATA urge end to travel curbs on African nations\n\nThe African Union (AU) has called for an urgent end to travel restrictions imposed on some of its member states, saying the measures effectively penalise governments for timely data sharing in line with international health regulations.\n\nThe measures act \u201cas a disincentive for information sharing in the future, potentially posing a threat to health security on the continent and globally,\u201d the AU said in a statement.\n\nAlso, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) yesterday called on governments to follow World Health Organisation (WHO) advice and immediately rescind travel bans that were introduced in response to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\nLagos sets condition for social events\n\nLagos State has clarified safety protocols to be adhered to before holding a party, especially in the wake of the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA statement by the Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, said it was necessary to clarify perceived ambiguities in the government\u2019s stance on social events and gatherings during the yuletide, and spell out what is expected of event organisers and attendees.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cAll social events must be duly registered to obtain Event Safety Clearance from the Lagos State Safety Commission, website: www.lasgsafetyreg.com, prior to holding; and the guidelines set out below must be strictly adhered to.\n\n\u201cWhere possible events should be held in an outdoor space; occupancy limit at any event must not exceed 60 per cent of maximum design capacity of the event centre; all attendees of a social gathering are expected to present their vaccination cards or digital bar code page, showing at least first dose, but preferably double dose full vaccination. In unvaccinated people, a negative PCR test within 72 hours will be an exemption; and guests and service providers with high temperature (above 37.5) are to be politely turned back and referred to paramedics or the emergency response team on ground.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cAll guests and service providers at the event must wear a nose mask or face shield before entry; all guests and service providers must endeavor to wash their hands before entering the venue or use hand sanitisers after which temperature checks should be carried out; and hand sanitisers to be positioned at the entry point and different spots within the venue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing, it is also appropriate, at this moment, to request that we should all exercise a high degree of care and responsibility towards ourselves and loved ones during the festive season. Let us, as much as possible, endeavor to avoid huge gatherings and events during this period, as experience has shown that these events have the tendency to be super spreading events.\n\n\u201cWe wish you all a very festive and blessed holiday season ahead.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Unveiling contenders and pretenders for Buhari\u2019s job",
          "text": "The nation\u2019s political atmosphere may look somber, but the reality is the days of President Muhammadu Buhari in power are constitutionally numbered. By May 29, 2023, the president would vacate the seat for a successor. With the leading parties set to pick their flagbearers in a matter, 2022 becomes pivotal. In this piece, YUSUF ALLI, MANAGING EDITOR, NORTHERN OPERATION looks at the pretenders and contenders in the race to produce the next occupant of Aso Rock.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo focused attention on the fact that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is winding down, when he declared on December 14th, 2021, that the president has nothing to offer anymore.\n\nHow do we prepare for post-Buhari? Buhari has done his best. My prayer is that God will spare his life to see his term through,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat should we do to make post-Buhari better than what we have now? That is our responsibility now, because it concerns all of us.\u201d\n\nObasanjo\u2019s comments is one of the most overt signlas that the race to install the next president is already engaged. Having had a hand in \u2018installing\u2019 and \u2018rejecting\u2019 successive administrations since 2007, it is uncertain if he and his ageing gang of powerbrokers will succeed in their twilight.\n\nJust like him, former President Ibrahim Babangida in August 2021 tried set parameters for what the next president must possess. He said: \u201cThat is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties. Those are the major qualities the new Nigerian President must possess.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFACTORS THAT WILL SHAPE 2023 PRESIDENCY\n\nSome of the factors that will shape 2023 presidency include power shift, state of the economy, security challenges, religious balancing, a free and fair electoral system, age, mode of party primaries, voting strength of geopolitical zones and Buhari\u2019s influence.\n\nZONING/ POWER SHIFT DEBACLE\n\nWith the North completing an eight-year tenure, the unwritten rule adopted over the years suggest a power shift to the South. Until the death of President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in 2010, the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) religiously kept to power rotation between the North and the South from 1999 to 2007.\n\nThe alleged abuse of the Doctrine of Necessity by ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 to retain the presidency in the South made him to lose his re-election bid to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nA Northern governor from PDP came out openly to accuse Jonathan of not honouring an agreement on power shift from the South to the North which brought him to power after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death.\n\nEven after restoring the presidency to the North for eight years, parties, governors and key actors have been singing discordant tunes on whether power should shift to the South. Ambitious political leaders and presidential aspirants have also compounded the North-South zoning agitation by tilting arguments in their favour\n\nThe zoning debacle is further clouded by lack of consensus on which part of the South (South-West, South-East and South-South) should produce the next president.\n\nFor making Buhari\u2019s victory possible, the Southwest has a sense of entitlement to get the presidential seat back. But the Southeast, which has not produced a civilian president since 1999, wants the ticket served a la carte.\n\nGovernor Okezie Ikpeazu says the Igbo deserve the presidential slot. Speaking at Aso Rock on Thursday, he said: \u201cI think that Southeasterners have a right to take a shot at the Presidency of Nigeria and I dare say that our qualification starts from the fact that we understand and know Nigeria better than the other states of Nigeria. I dare say, this is my opinion. We go everywhere, we are everywhere, we invest everywhere, we are a pan-Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the South-South, which lost power to Buhari in 2015 wants it back to sustain the age-long political ties between it and the North. In the Second Republic, the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN), which produced late President Shehu Shagari, was more at home in a North-South-South alliance than with any other part of the country.\n\nWhile late Chief Obafemi Awolowo of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria(UPN) held on firmly to his political fortress in the Southwest and Mid-West, late Nnamdi Azikiwe\u2019s Nigeria Peoples Party(NPP) was in firm control of the Southeast.\n\nBut the 2015 general election changed the equation with a new romance between the North and Southwest riding on the political vision of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu and other progressives in the country. The same faith was extended to Buhari in 2019 when the South-South and the Southeast pitched tent with the opposition PDP.\n\nSince July 6, 2021 when the Southern Governors Forum stirred the hornet\u2019s nest and reopened debate on power shift, there have been varied arguments bordering on the constitutionality of zoning.\n\nThe drama is more interesting in the APC. Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, said his party has no rotational clause or power shift term in its constitution. But his Borno State counterpart Babagana Zulum argues it is morally trite to allow the South to take the presidential slot in 2023.\n\nThe PDP Committee on the Review of 2019 elections, headed by Governor Bala Mohammed also recommended in March 2021 that zoning be discarded.\n\nThe governor, who has now declared interest in 2023 presidential race, summarized the findings of his committee. He said: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North East and South East geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the presidency should be given special consideration in choosing the presidential flag bearer of the party for the 2023 elections,\u201d Bala Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. Moreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian, from every part of the country, should be given the opportunity to choose the best candidate through a credible primary election, as a way of institutionalizing a merit-based leadership recruitment process, for the country.\u201d\n\nUntil a palace coup ousted him, former National Chairman of PDP, Prince Uche Secondus and his National Working Committee (NWC) did not consider Mohammed\u2019s panel\u2019s report. It is still gathering dust on PDP\u2019s office shelves.\n\nFor APC, there is no consensus yet on its position on zoning. The suspense over the party\u2019s convention has been attributed to the delay in fashioning out modalities for navigating the situation.\n\nA former Chairman of INEC, Prof. Attahiru Jega follows a different path. He asked Nigerians to forget rotational presidency. He said: \u201cThe way Nigeria is now, we need the best person with competence, capacity, experience to be the president to get this country out of the challenges we have presently. That person can come from the north, south, east or the west, but the important thing is that even if political parties decide that a candidate should come from a particular area, what we need to do is that Nigerians must interrogate the capacity of that person to lead this country appropriately.\n\n\u201cThis idea of rotational presidency cannot take us out of the challenges we have in this country, presently.\u201d\n\nECONOMY\n\nThe next president will not only shoulder Nigeria\u2019s N38trillion public debts (inching towards N50trillion) but tackle 33.3% jobless rate; humanitarian crisis; poverty; corruption; bad roads; rot in education and health sectors and social problems.\n\nSo, will Nigerians demand a technocrat or an economist as their next president or the run-of-the-mill politician? Certainly, any aspirant with resourcefulness and capacity to find practical solutions to the myriad of problems facing the nation may appeal more to Nigerians than anyone mouthing his or her plans.\n\nSECURITY CHALLENGES\n\nThe Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, attacks by gunmen have not only increased the cost of conducting elections, they have heightened fears over a free and fair poll in 2023.\n\nApart from states with perennial security problems, the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, a few days ago raised the alarm that bandits were massing in Falgore forest.\n\nThe insurgents and bandits have always targeted communication facilities which could hamper electronic transmission of results. This may be compounded by the government\u2019s admission that about 301 out of the 774 local government areas in the country don\u2019t have internet access.\n\nThe INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said the country must break the circle of impunity, violence and identity theft to have peaceful polls.\n\nWithout doubt, the central theme of the 2022 /2023 campaign will be on how to end the lingering insecurity because Nigerians are looking for solutions to the siege.\n\nUnless Buhari lives up to his promise to end terrorism and banditry before leaving office, the Achilles Heel of APC in 2023 might be the inability of its government to address the security stress nationwide.\n\nVOTING STRENGTH LIKELY TO SHAPE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION/ALLIANCE\n\nA group that has emphasized this is the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) which does not care if the next president comes from the North. Although the workability of the North-Southwest alliance in 2015 set a template for national unity, it also paved the way for a new electoral calculation which can make the North to retain power.\n\nAccording to INEC voters demographic spread for 2019 poll, 84,004,084 registered with about 44,813,463 voters from the 19 Northern states and the FCT. The Southeast, with profound voter apathy as witnessed in the recently-concluded governorship poll in Anambra State has about 10,057,130 voters compared to the Southwest\u2019s 16,292,212 and South-South\u2019s 12,841, 279.\n\nWith the increasing activities of IPOB, the statistics makes any presidential aspirant from the Southeast politically vulnerable if he or she does not build bridges across the Niger. For any aspirant from the North-Central, the zone\u2019s voting power of 12,021,214 may look attractive but the landscape is more heterogeneous than any geopolitical zone in the country. A source described North-Central as a \u201czone without meeting point.\u201d\n\nAddressing the inaugural edition of Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series, organized by the students wing of the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria, the spokesperson of the Northern Elders Forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed laid bare the voting strength factor.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before; whether we are president or vice president, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and democracy says vote whom you want. Why should we accept a second-class position when we know we can buy forms and contest for first-class and we will win?\n\nPARTY PRIMARIES\n\nThe fallout of the conduct of primaries in APC and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) (essentially the obvious party choices) might lead to realignment of political forces by aggrieved aspirants.\n\nThe battle for the souls of APC and PDP is still raging with the powers that be scrambling to hijack all structures ahead of 2023. In PDP, which just concluded a national convention, the party\u2019s governors have retained the tradition of controlling the party structure to the discomfiture of some presidential aspirants.\n\nIn APC, the plot to outwit each other has made the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee shift the date for its convention in February. Yet, some forces are pushing for the conduct of primaries at all levels before holding the convention.\n\nThe politics of the primaries and the aftermath may force some politicians to dump their parties. A few others may stay put for sabotage if they lose out in the scheme of things. The development in the two main parties will define the 2023 race.\n\nHaving rejected the Electoral Act Amendment Bill because of the clause on direct primaries, the president has forced the parties to adopt indirect primaries, which may seal the fate of many aspirants at all levels. At the presidential level, the governors in APC and PDP may install their candidates as standard-bearers.\n\nBUHARI\u2019S INFLUENCE\n\nJudging by the way he has been micro-managing APC from the Presidential Villa, Buhari is a strong factor on who gets his party\u2019s presidential ticket this year. Unchallenged, he has unilaterally extended the tenure of APC Caretaker Committee and as the leader of the party, he is fully aware of where the party is headed.\n\nAll those seeking to lead APC have been heading for his doorstep, tapping his friends/ strategists for consideration. On the surface, he seems taciturn but those familiar with the inner workings of the Villa said the President knows those who will not succeed him.\n\nThere was a story of a former governor wielding influence to lead APC because of free cash at his disposal. When Buhari heard, he purportedly said: \u201cThat one\u2026\u201d The ex-governor has since toned down the tempo of his campaign because of the presidential signal.\n\nAnother former governor said: \u201cBuhari will surely play a key role in the choice of a new chairman and the presidential candidate of the party. The truth is that every incumbent is always interested in his successor not only for continuity of programmes but not to rock the boat. The masses will, however, decide whether they like his presidential preference.\u201d\n\nThe next few months will shed further light on what transpired between Buhari and some politicians during the negotiation for merger of political parties into APC. One former governor said there was \u201can understanding among stakeholders that power will shift to the South after Buhari\u2019s tenure.\u201d\n\nTHE AGE FACTOR\n\nYoung elements in different parties have been canvassing for a youthful president. However, the emergence of ex-President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden in the US, has thrown wrench in such arguments \u2013 showing that age is not always the most important factor in a democracy.\n\nWHO DOES THE CAP FIT?\n\nWhile awaiting the schedule of elections from INEC, a motley crowd of presidential aspirants is growing from the six geopolitical zones across party lines. While some are strong contenders, others are pretenders and a few clever ones bidding for other offices or only seeking attention with their aspiration.\n\nThe list includes Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governors Kayode Fayemi, Yahaya Bello, Nyesom Wike, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed and Dave Umahi; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; ex-President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim; ex-governors Ibikunle Amosun, Rabiu Kwankwaso, Sule Lamido, Peter Obi, Ahmed Sani Yerima, Ogbonnaya Onu and Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nOthers are Rochas Okorocha; Minister of State for Education, Dr. Emeka Nwajiuba; a former CEO of Neimeth Pharmaceutical, Sam Ohuanbuwa; and a former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr, Kingsley Moghalu.\n\nA recurring name being propped up for the presidency is ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, who not unforthcoming on his plans.\n\nYEMI OSINBAJO\n\nThe incumbent Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, is yet to openly declare his ambition but he has not disowned all the groups pushing for him, including Osinbajo Grassroot Organization (OGO) which visited ex-President Ibrahim Babangida last week.\n\nAlthough, he is a product of Tinubu\u2019s political platform, Osinbajo has never been a politician until circumstances threw him up in 2015. During the countdown to 2019 election, he showed some traits of emerging a populist politician by selling politico-economic products like Tradermoni and Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT).\n\nHis marketing of some government\u2019s micro-credit schemes earned him the wrath of some members of The Cabal, who decided to cut him to size when Buhari earned a second term ticket. He has retreated to the shadows.\n\nHis strength lies in his intellectual endowment, strong ethics, ability to appeal to and get backing from the Christian community in the country. His weakness is being perceived as something of a religious zealot \u2013 may be because he is a pastor.\n\nSo far, Osinbajo is an underdog and a David facing many Goliaths.\n\nASIWAJU BOLA TINUBU\n\nA gifted leader whose ability for mentoring others is unequaled. He combines both political and economic vision judging by the sustainable development foundation he laid in Lagos. His political network is as huge as his large heart. Since 1991/92, he has been an issue in the nation\u2019s political space.\n\nHe is also blindly loyal to a cause as he was to the late Chief M.K.O Abiola during the June 12, 1993 election crisis and Buhari in 2015 despite losing vice presidential ticket to intra-party conspiracy.\n\nNo Nigerian politician is as prepared for the 2023 presidential race as Asiwaju and key players in APC detected this early. This accounts for the desperation to stop him at all cost including alleged sponsoring of political rebellion against him in the Southwest; seizure of APC structure from him with the coup against ex-APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and the latest plot to retain presidency in the North. T\n\nThough being ambushed everywhere, Tinubu has a can-do spirit which has made him to survive many tribulations including going on exile to be able to outlast the oppressive military regime of the late Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha and fight for the restoration of democracy in the country.\n\nThe body language of President Buhari will define to a large extent, the political journey of Tinubu in 2023. If APC allows power shift to the Southwest in the next dispensation, he is likely to be the candidate to beat. If the party decides otherwise, the former governor as a loyal party (he\u2019s never been one to flit from platform to platform) man will sit with other leaders on how to address the challenge. Definitely, the Jagaban of Borgu has many battles to fight between now and 2023.\n\nWhat is really between Buhari and Tinubu? Was there any unwritten or unseen agreement? The pioneer National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) Rufai Hanga said there was an agreement which made Tinubu to support Buhari. In an interview with Daily Trust, he said: \u201cThis is an open secret. There was an implied agreement. Even in law, there is an implied and expressed act. If something is expressed, there are no two ways about it. There was an implied agreement that he would take over. That is why he didn\u2019t back out after the first tenure. If Tinubu knew that he would not benefit, he would have backed out during Buhari\u2019s first tenure. But he knows there was an agreement.\u201d\n\nATIKU ABUBAKAR\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar is aware he\u2019s on the last lap of his political career. Since 1992, he has been a serial presidential aspirant and candidate. He emerged flagbearer of the defunct Action Congress in 2007, Northern consensus candidate for PDP presidential primaries in 2011; lost to Buhari at the APC primaries for the 2015 election; and was candidate of PDP for 2019 poll.\n\nA cosmopolitan politician and a long distance runner, the 75-year old has a rich network across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\nAtiku\u2019s has two major hurdles to cross to get the PDP mandate for 2023. He needs to earn the confidence of the party\u2019s governors, some of whom are aspiring to be president too. Atiku, who beat the governors to their game at the convention in Port Harcourt is now at their mercy for the next ticket. There were doubts that he can get the slot in view of the desperation of some governors.\n\nAlso, the zoning policy of the party may end his career. With the new National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu from North-Central, the party may concede the ticket to the South. But if Ayu is prevailed upon to step down for a Southern chairman, Atiku will have to slug it out with Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, former governors Sule Lamido, Rabiu Kwankwaso and other aspirants from the North who may emerge later.\n\nIBIKUNLE AMOSUN\n\nA political confidant of President Buhari, ex-Ogun Governor Ibikunle Amosun is secretly oiling his presidential ambition to the knowledge of members of the Aso Rock kitchen cabinet. A top source described him as \u201cthe most likely last joker of The Cabal if there is no other option.\u201d\n\nIn the last few months, Amosun has been consulting some national leaders and party stalwarts, including some APC presidential aspirants. His attitude is that \u201cit can be anybody, no animosity.\u201d\n\nApart from coming from the same state with the Vice President, Amosun is not even in control of the party structure in Ogun State where Governor Dapo Abiodun has a grip.\n\nSome strategists in the presidency expressed fears that \u201che might be difficult to sell to the people of the Southwest with Tinubu\u2019s looming influence.\u201d\n\nBut a reliable source said: \u201cI think Tinubu and Amosun have reconciled their political differences. They are now on good terms. His quiet, achievements-oriented tenure and loyalty to the party after losing the party structure have endeared him to Buharists.\n\nGoing by nature of politics, Amosun is presently like a shepherd without flock. Yet, he is a dangerous underdog.\n\nKAYODE FAYEMI\n\nEkiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has grown from being a guerilla activist of NADECO era to one of the key players in Nigerian politics.\n\nHis rise to the office of the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum(NGF) has earned him more mileage in terms of access to the powers-that-be and scheming in the Presidential Villa.\n\nHe is rated as one of those who has the ears of Buhari. The president reportedly developed interest in him for not taking bribes during the conduct of the 2014 presidential primaries. Not necessarily a member of The Cabal but he\u2019s a rallying point with some of the bigwigs.\n\nWith June 18, 2022 for the election of his successor looming his time as governor is nearly up. It is widely believed he\u2019s eyeing the presidency. But he has left all his supporters and admirers to read between the lines.\n\nHe has also made it clear in a recent interview that he is qualified for the job. He said: \u201cI will like to think I have the requisite qualifications to be the President of Nigeria. \u201d\n\nROTIMI AMAECHI\n\nA two-time Director-General of the APC Presidential Campaign Organization, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, is yet to declare interest in the 2023 presidential race but feelers indicate he is interested.\n\nBesides regaining the APC structure in Rivers State to solidify his home front, Amaechi was a key force in setting up the Buni-led National Caretaker Committee of APC, especially the choice of the Secretary, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, who is from the South-South with him.\n\nWithout declaring his interest, the rate at which many groups have floated structures for him in the 36 states and FCT is foretelling the battle ahead in 2023.\n\nAmaechi\u2019s greatest strength is his performance in office, especially railway development.\n\nThe challenges before Amaechi are the PDP and Wike\u2019s threats in Rivers State and the zoning factor \u2013 especially the pressure by the North to retain power. His acceptance by the core north is an issue. Amaechi may end up with a vice presidential ticket depending on the disposition of the president.\n\nBUKOLA SARAKI\n\nSince 2011, Saraki has been trying to be Nigeria\u2019s president. Twice he has failed to get the ticket. In 2011, he lost the bid to Atiku at the consensus level and in 2018, he came distant third behind Atiku at the Port Harcourt convention of PDP. He later became the Director-General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organization for 2019 poll.\n\nMore than any aspirant in PDP. Saraki appears to be the early bird but he is a troubled leader because APC snatched his Kwara State platform from him in 2019 through \u2018O To Ge\u2019 revolution. He is no doubt distracted for the presidency in 2023. If Saraki is given a choice, he will want to regain Kwara from APC.\n\nNotwithstanding, the ex-governor has built a bridge which has improved the political heritage from his father, whose presidential bids in the Second, Third and Fourth Republics crashed because of mistrust by the North.\n\nA smart politician, Saraki\u2019s setback, however, will be PDP governors who may not endorse him. Although Governor Seyi Makinde is actively supporting him, others are not too keen. He has to contest again for the ticket with some of those who defeated him in the past including Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal.\n\nNYESOM WIKE\n\nIt is difficult to know the mindset of Governor Nyesom Wike, who has been speaking in parables of late. But he is one PDP\u2019s influential governor with the party in his pocket. According to sources, Wike single-handedly shopped for and installed Iyorchia Ayu as the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nThere are speculations of Wike running a joint ticket as Vice Presidential candidate with Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal as PDP flag bearer.\n\nRecently in Yola, Wike said: \u201cI am not a supporter of those who are calling for zoning of the presidency. I am for those that are calling for good candidate that can bring this country together, and improve on the potentials that abound in both human and capital of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nBut it will not be an easy ride for Wike in 2023 because of Amaechi\u2019s rejuvenated machinery. As an outgoing governor, APC will capitalize on his leaking home. Wike had muzzled intra and inter-party opposition. This may be his undoing in 2023.\n\nANYIM PIUS ANYIM\n\nA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, has proved all bookmakers wrong with his miraculous resurgence in the nation\u2019s politics. And his push for presidential ticket is gaining momentum.\n\nFor a leader who has always depended on providence, Anyim cannot be underrated in any form. He is blessed with humility and a divine touch to follow his dream. He is not ready to waver on his ambition.\n\nHis advantages are his ability to speak truth to power and resist despotism. His weakness is making his ambition a quest for the liberation of the Igbo. He needs to operate within a national prism which he was known for as the President of the Senate.\n\nHe has a match in Governor Dave Umahi who he bankrolled but now eroding his empire. The ex-SGF is reorganizing PDP in Ebonyi State in a stifled environment.\n\nRABIU KWANKWASO\n\nKwankwaso is an old political war horse who has a way of bouncing back into reckoning after defeat. In 2014, he came second with 974 votes to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s 3,430 votes. But he lost Buhari\u2019s favour for allegedly being so \u201cdaring.\u201d He bolted to PDP in 2018 for greener pastures.\n\nHe was, however, defeated at the PDP primaries by Atiku who garnered 1,532 votes to his insignificant158 votes. Since 2018, he has restricted himself to the Kwankwansiyya movement in Kano.\n\nExcept for living on the old glory of backing by ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, Kwankwaso doesn\u2019t have the sort of resources to contest the primaries. This is why he is preoccupied with rapprochement politics with his hitherto sworn enemies.\n\nHe does not have the support spread nationwide like when he was in power.\n\nSULE LAMIDO\n\nThe ambition of a former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido is taken with a pinch of salt due to his pariah political status. APC has not given him breathing space since he completed his tenure in 2015.\n\nPresently standing trial for alleged N1.35billion fraud, the ex-governor has to remove the corruption yoke before moving to another level. PDP is unlikely to give him its ticket.\n\nHe is probably on the presidential quest to build up his confidence.\n\nYAHAYA BELLO\n\nAn apostle of Not-Too-Young-To-Run politics, Governor Yahaya Bello\u2019s presidential aspiration is seeing by many APC leaders as a consequence of youthful exuberance. Armed with a huge war chest, he\u2019s an early starter who is trying to spread his political wings to all parts of the country.\n\nHis early unfolding of his presidential aspiration has however backfired with some forces conspiring against him.\n\nBello\u2019s recent face-off with EFCC may hinder his ambition unless he gets reprieve from the court.\n\nPETER OBI\n\nFormer Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, was PDP\u2019s vice presidential candidate in 2019. He is still interested in the race but says he does not want to jump the gun.\n\nIn spite of a recent invitation by the EFCC, Obi is trusted by many as an astute politician and shrewd manager of resources. His ongoing invitation by the anti-graft agency may slow down his aspiration.\n\nAMINU WAZIRI TAMBUWAL\n\nSokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, is one of the top contenders for the PDP\u2019s presidential ticket. A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, he lost the same prize to Atiku in 2018.\n\nA political soul mate of Wike, Tambuwal enjoys the confidence of prominent Northern monarchs and progressive elements in the Southwest. He is a mix of conservatism and a bit of radicalism.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s problem is impatience due to his overt presidential ambition. He has shifted political tent between APC and PDP since 2014 and the best he got was a gubernatorial offer.\n\nBALA MOHAMMED\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed is a cosmopolitan politician. He was in the vanguard of those who invoked the Doctrine of Necessity which led to the emergence of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan as Acting President in 2010 before winning the main election in 2011.\n\nHis strength borders on fairness and equity. He was careful in piloting the activities of the PDP Committee on the Review of 2019 elections which later claimed that zoning was unnecessary. There were speculations that he seized the advantage of the committee to lay the foundation for his aspiration.\n\nApart from his landmark achievements as FCT Minister, Bala was the first governor in the Northeast to domesticate Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act. He has a suspended case with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) which may be an issue during the campaign if he gets PDP ticket.\n\nAs a Fulani, his promotion of religious harmony between Muslims and Christians in the state has made him unique in a zone with religious fundamentalism problem.\n\nDuring a Christmas celebration at the Government House in Bauchi, the Chairman Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Abraham Damina Dimeus, said the governor should forget about running for President. He said \u201cThough we are ready to go with you anywhere you go, for now, we still need you to remain here in Bauchi State to complete the good job you started.\n\nMore aspirants may join the race and even more may drop out in coming weeks and months. But for now attention shifts to INEC to release the schedule of electoral activities for the 2023 poll.",

          "title": "2022 prophecy: Tough time awaits Kanu, Igboho",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nPrimate Babatunde Elijah Ayodele of Inri Evangelical Spiritual Church, Lagos, has issued fresh divine insights on how Nigeria can survival 2022, a year he described as a mixed bag, even as he released fresh predictions for the year.\n\nThe popular seer in an exclusive interview with Sunday Sun urged Nigerians to be watchful and prayerful in the New Year in order to avert looming troubles ahead just as he announced that the first seven days of the year have been set aside for prayers for the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first 160 days in 2022 Nigerians must be very careful and prayerful because of the evil of that period that is why we have set aside the first seven days of the year for prayers to avert the looming dangers ahead. The year 2022 is a year of mixed bag. So as a country we need prayers in order to avert avoidable troubles\u201d.\n\nPrimate Ayodele said that contrary to insinuations, the Federal Government has no agenda to kill Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu, who are currently in detentions, but revealed that the duo might not find it easy as they battle to regain their freedom.\n\nHis words: \u201cSunday Igboho must calm down. In fact, he needs to change his lawyer. He should look for a new and senior \u201cSalami\u201d to handle his case. In addition to that, if Igboho does not handle his matter very well he will stay longer in detention. The Nigerian government is so much interested in him. They are not going to kill him, but they are keen on holding him until the end of this administration. So, he must be very prayerful.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu will not find it so easy as well. He should still expect tough time because the government is not ready to free him for one second. He needs to be very prayerful and watchful this time around. The government does not have any plans to kill either Igboho or Kanu. They should put that insinuation aside. Government will employ all sorts of tactics to prolong their days in detention. This year will be a tougher year for IPOB and ESN. There will be confrontations and killing between the nation\u2019s security forces and IPOB and ESN.\u201d\n\nOn the nation\u2019s economy, Primate Ayodele said: \u201cNigerians need to be watchful about the nation\u2019s economy. Our economy is going down. Oil will be discovered in few other places, but it will not impact on the economy. Some documents will leak from NNPC and that will put the corporation into troubles. This will create problem for the Minister of Petroleum and the GMD of NNPC.\n\n\u201cThe planned removal of fuel subsidy will plunge Nigeria into deeper problem. In addition to the hike in price of PMS, Nigerians must also expect scarcity of the product this year. I am seeing protest which can grind Buhari\u2019s government for some time.\u201d\n\nHis revelations for the New Year also captures the nation\u2019s politics and the political actors in the country.\n\n\u201cI will like to warn Hope Uzodimma not to waste his time and resources on re-election because he will definitely lose. PDP will take over the state at the end of next election. APC will not win Cross Rivers although the incumbent governor, Ben Ayade belongs to APC. And if the man aspires to run for presidency or Vice President, his dream will not see the light of the day.\n\n\u201cTinubu will face a lot of trials and complications. He should drop his presidential ambition for better things because God has not ordained him. If anybody puts him there they will just mess this country up.\n\n\u201cAtiku will not make a better option as the president of Nigeria. If PDP gives it to Atiku, the party should bid the 2023 presidency goodbye.\n\n\u201cKwankwaso wants to decamp; if he decamps to APC, he will just mess himself up,\u201d he revealed.\n\nConcerning the 2023 elections, the man of God said: \u201cThese are the people God revealed to me as presidential and vice presidential materials if they are lucky to be picked.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIn APC, we have people like Zulum, Mala Buni, governor of Yobe; Boss Mustapha, Malami, Fashola, Aregbesola, Fayemi and Akpabio. The endorsement of Osinbajo by Babangida is a waste of time. Osinbajo would have been a good choice, but the northerners do not want him. These are the people Buhari should support. Buhari will not support Tinubu. The rotational president Nigerians are clamouring for is not too certain. In fact, power may return to the North if care is not taken.\n\n\u201cIn PDP, talking of presidential and vice presidential candidates, I can see Tambuwal, Saraki, Bala, Wike, Okowa, Makinde, Udom, Ortom and Enugu State governor. Things can change tomorrow, but at the moment this is the list of people God revealed to me. I am still praying to God who among them is going to be the president. I will reveal the person immediately God shows me the person.\n\n\u201cOgun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, is going to make a lot of mistakes. Amosun will still tackle him. If care is not taken Amosun boys will come back. If Amosun can retrace his steps and find a way to bring back his boys, including the disgruntled ones, Amosun boys will take over from Dapo Abiodun in 2023. Abiodun will face so many problems. Abiodun\u2019s efforts will not be appreciated because he has stepped on so many toes. He must strive hard to prevent people decamping from his party and restrain himself from committing more blunders.\n\n\u201cIf Ekweremadu can work very hard, because they want to gang up against his governorship ambition in Enugu State, PDP will still win, PDP will win Imo State, PDP will win Cross River. PDP will still win Abia State.\n\n\u201cSome people will still decamp to PDP after the APC convention, APC will be shaken. The best chairmanship candidate that can help APC is Suswam.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Bill will not be allowed to fly as expected. The Senate and House of Representatives will still have to be watchful and prayerful. I am seeing a new building for the Senate.\n\n\u201cI see confusion in Aso Rock. Sensitive documents that will expose Buhari\u2019s government will leak. Some Buhari\u2019s cabinet members will be accused of corruption. EFCC will go after some people that have political ambitions and kill their ambitions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on insecurity and crisis in the country, the Lagos-based cleric said: \u201cNigerians must pray very well so that our military facilities and other sensitive places will not be attacked. Boko Haram will strike harder between February and July. In particularly, we must be prayerful and watchful in the months of February and March because of the evil plans of these enemies of the state. They should be watchful in Lagos, Abuja, Rivers. Maiduguri, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Zamfara and Gombe.\n\n\u201cThe crisis in the Southern Kaduna will rear its ugly head again in 2022 and this will spoil the chances of APC in Kaduna. El-Rufai and Ganduje should not dream to be president likewise I can\u2019t see Yahyah Bello as president of this country.\n\n\u201cThere will be more confusion. Let pray so our security operatives fighting insecurity will not go on strike. Nigeria cannot defeat these terrorists without engaging mercenaries. There will be an attempt by these terrorists to launch missile attacks against fighter jets. So let us pray not to see a plane that will crash at Murtala Airport or a plane overshooting the runway. We should also pray against NAF plane crashing. We must pray so that our military fighting Boko Haram will not be ambushed. Let us pray so that pirates will not attack our Navy on the high sea.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pray against the attack on a governor\u2019s convoy, the CBN governor falling sick. Let\u2019s pray for a Commissioner in Ogun State and in Kaduna, Sokoto and in Plateau.\n\n\u201cSome banks are going to have issues. CBN is going to contend with a lot of troubles. Some banks are going to face CBN challenges. These include First Bank, Access Bank, Unity Bank, Stanbic, Eco Bank and GTB.\u201d\n\nThe man of God urged Nigerians not to disregard the COVID-19 protocols put in place by health authorities in the country, saying, \u201cNigerians must take the issue of Coronavirus seriously. The world will still have to contend with the virus throughout the New Year by having to observe the protocols that are in place.\u201d",

But this tension will reduce after the two parties pick their candidates. The Lord did not abandon this nation and there will be a strong statement from heaven to prove it. God in his wisdom will reunite this nation through a southerner who has what it takes to reunite the country and provide a peaceful atmosphere for all man and businesses.\n\n\u201cSome people complain about Buhari\u2019s presidency because they are spiritually blind to see what would have happened if Buhari was not the president. Buhari became president at a time the nation needed him and God approved it. I have seen Orji Uzor Kalu of the Southeast and Nyesom Wike of the South-south in the final election.\n\n\u201cHow it would happen is what I don\u2019t know, but these two will be the presidential candidates of the APC and PDP. Our duty is to pray for the anointed not to turn his back on God when he becomes the president; 2022 is coming with a lot of challenges, but we will continue to pray for you. A lot have been revealed to me and I want you to be strong and never entertain fear. God would always provide for His people.\u201d\n\nProphet Arogun came to limelight when in the New Year of 2014, he narrated how President Goodluck Jonathan would lose the 2015 election to Buhari.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said that Buhari\u2019s victory would be welcomed by Nigerians and international community because God had anointed Buhari to lead the country.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, Prophet Arogun also prophesied about the 2023 presidency and President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\nSpeaking during his new month ministration service, he said that Buhari\u2019s successor is a former governor from the Southeast who was in prison. He said that God put him in prison to preserve his life, adding that he would be released after six months.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am a prophet of God and by the grace of God, anything the Lord tells us comes to pass because we hear from Him; we don\u2019t hear from men.\n\nWe don\u2019t rely on public opinion for prophecies. We are not afraid of what people will say when such prophecies are given to us to tell the people. When we hear from the Lord, we tell people no matter how it is interpreted. It is left for people to take it.\n\n\u201cBefore the 2015 election, God told me that Buhari would win; And God told me a lot of things about Buhari. It is He that anointed him to be the president and there is no questions about that. No one can change it. The people can hate him: the people can reject him, but God has ordained him, and there is something about God. When He says that you would be this, no man can change it. He does what pleases Him.\n\n\u201cI got a revelation about Nigeria\u2019s political dynamics in the next general election. I saw a man in prison and this man has been a former governor from the Southeast taking over from President Buhari. There is absolutely nothing one can do about someone\u2019s destiny especially when sanctioned by God. Everything that happens in life is for a reason. I saw renewed alliances among the political class and across the political parties and I saw this country reuniting more than it has ever done before. God loves Nigeria so much. Nigeria is a big country, and is blessed with human and natural resources.\u201d",

It is going to be a costly venture for them because during election, it is like a draft game. You anticipate the opponent to see the seed he wants to play next. That seed of PDP of going North will backfire. They better align with APC and if APC comes South, let them also come South. So, it becomes an all-South affair. But if they go North, I can tell them that as it is today, they will lose the presidential election, no matter the candidate they bring from the North. The Southeasterners will feel that they have been used and dumped. The Southeast, South-south will feel that they have been used and dumped. The Southwest too will feel it is the turn of South as the Southern governors agreed and in the North-central, the minority sympathy in the Middle Belt will come in.\u201d\n\nNgige stated this while fielding questions from journalists at his country home in Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra State, on the eve of the New Year.\n\n\u201cSo, we expect that our national chairman this time around will come from the North and our presidential candidate will come from the South and it is left for the Southerners to decide the zone it will go among Southeast, South-south and Southwest, but for equity and moral ground, the Southeast should be as it is the only one yet to produce the president since 1999,\u201d he said\n\nHe said that his strong support for the emergence of a president of Southern extraction was in line with the rotation and zoning convention guiding the composition of government at various levels in the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

He will be buried at 4.00 pm today at his Popoyemoja, Ibadan Palace according to Muslim rites. Other things follow later.\u201d\n\nAlso, the UCH in a statement by the Deputy Director of Information and Public Relations Officer, Mr. Toye Akinrinlola, said Oba Adetunji, who was brought to the hospital from a private clinic, died at 1.15 a.m.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Olubadan of Ibadanland, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Oguguniso 1, today passed on at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University College Hospital, Ibadan at 1.15 am.\n\n\u201cThe late Monarch was referred to the UCH from a private hospital in Ibadan at about 9.30 pm yesterday. He was immediately admitted at the ICU where the Chief Medical Director CMD, Professor Jesse Abiodun Otegbayo directed that a high-powered medical team be constituted to provide the best medical treatment to him.\n\n\u201cBy 1.15 am today, His Imperial Majesty breathed his last breath.\n\n\u201cThe CMD was at the ICU in the early hours of today to pay the late Olubadan his last respect. According to the CMD, \u201cThe Olubadan was a father to all of us. His reign was peaceful. We went to him on a few occasions when we had problems and he gave us listening ears\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfterward, the CMD wrote a letter of notification of the demise of the revered Monarch to His Excellency Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State which was received by the Permanent Secretary of the Oyo State Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Dr. Bashiru Olanrewaju on behalf of the Oyo State Government. A similar letter was written to the Family of the departed Olubadan.\n\n\u201cThe CMD further ensured that the remains of the late Monarch were taken care of in a manner befitting to the late Olubadan.\n\n\u201cProfessor Otegbayo also escorted the corpse of Oba Adetunji from the ICU to a waiting ambulance and handed the corpse to the family and other dignitaries on the ground.\n\n\u201cProfessor Otegbayo bidded Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, the late Olubadan of Ibadanland a peaceful rest in the bosom of God.\u201d\n\nGovernor Makinde in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, expressed his condolences to the immediate family of the Olubadan, the Olubadan-in-Council and all Ibadan indigenes as well as the Oyo State Traditional Council, stating that Kabiyesi gave his all to see that Ibadanland is developed and took its pride of place as one of the major cities in Africa.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe news of the death of our father, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, came as a shock.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi\u2019s exit at this time is painful, to say the least. His wealth of experience, his immense wisdom and his commitment to seeing a greater Ibadan and a better Oyo State are unrivalled.\n\n\u201cIbadan, Oyo State, Nigeria and humanity at large will miss Kabiyesi, who was ever ready to give his all to see a better society.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with his immediate family, the Olubadan-in-Council, the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII) and all Ibadan indigenes at home and abroad on the demise of our father.\n\n\u201cI equally extend my condolences to the Oyo State Traditional Council and pray to God to keep all our Obas safe and give them more years to direct the affairs of our people, especially as Olubadan\u2019s death is coming on the heels of the demise of the Soun of Ogbomosoland and Asigangan of Igangan. May God grant them all eternal rest.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in honour of the departed monarch, all markets in the ancient city would be closed Monday.\n\nThe Babaloja General of Oyo State, Alhaji Yekini Abass Oladapo, said the decision to close the markets was taken at an emergency meeting of market leaders council in the state, praying for the repose of his soul and that Allah grants him Aljana fridaous.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Say internal rivalries in APC normal\n\n*Optimistic president will tackle insecurity\n\n*El-Rufai denies alleged pact to contest with Fayemi\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and his Kaduna State counterpart, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai have defended the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to reject the direct primary clause in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, 2021.\n\nAlso, the governors have rejected the public perception that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is fractured amid internal rivalries among the different power blocs ahead of its national convention in February 2022 and 2023 general elections.\n\nThey made these clarifications yesterday in separate interviews on ARISE NEWS Channel.\n\nThe two APC governors backed Buhari\u2019s rejection of the bill against the position of the National Assembly.\n\nBefore Buhari declined assent to the bill, the federal lawmakers and the governors had lobbied the presidency over the bill.\n\nWhile the lawmakers were in support of the direct primary, the governors were opposed to the clause in the bill.\n\nFayemi and el-Rufai argued that Buhari was an advocate of direct primary, through which he emerged as the presidential candidate of the APC in 2018.\n\nSpecifically, el-Rufai explained that the president \u201chas always been an advocate of direct primary from our days in the Congress for Progressives Change through to our last primary in 2018 when he ran for the second term.\n\n\u201cIdeologically and personally, Buhari prefers direct primary to indirect primary because he believes direct primary is the one that gives party members greater participation in deciding who is their candidate rather than a few elected delegates that can be susceptible to corruption,\u201d the Kaduna State governor explained.\n\nHe listed four conditions that could make a direct primary model effective across all states of the federation, pointing out that no state had been able to meet all the conditions for the seamless conduct of primaries.\n\nThe Kaduna State governor first cited the need for all political parties to have a credible membership register, which according to him, every stakeholder of a political party agreed that it \u201cis the real membership register of the party.\u201d\n\nHe also explained the need for every party member \u201cto have a biometric card with a barcode so that it can be easily identified before he can vote in the primary. We need to produce cards similar to the permanent voters\u2019 cards of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\u201d\n\nHe equally highlighted a mechanism for counting votes in the direct primary as part of the four conditions for adopting the model, noting that every party member and stakeholder \u201cmust have confidence in such a system of vote-counting.\u201d\n\nThe governor listed the imperatives of security in the conduct of direct primaries across the federation, placing emphasis on the need to prevent non-party members from coming into the venue to vote or prevent thugs from being imported to disrupt the voting process.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we do not have these conditions, direct primary will be a disaster. We can adopt a direct primary mode if we have the infrastructure in place. But how many states in Nigeria have the infrastructure? Kaduna is the state in the federation that has the infrastructure to conduct direct primaries.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the level of preparedness of the political parties for the direct primary \u201cis probably questionable. As I said earlier, Kaduna is perhaps the only state that had one element of the four conditions that I pointed out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason some politicians are calling for a direct primary is that they think they can do what happened in Lagos, Anambra or so and write the result. It is not because they think the direct primary is quite possible,\u201d he said\n\nHe urged Nigerians \u201cto be very discerning, careful and understand the process of direct primary and the conditioned precedents as against the indirect primary and not make our moral judgment without understanding the dynamics of it.\n\n\u201cHere, in Kaduna State, we are neutral. We do direct primary. We can do indirect primary. We don\u2019t have problems in our party. We have a united party. We also have some elements that enable us to do direct primary. I am not sure others have it.\n\n\u201cThis is the part of the reasons President Buhari held on the side of caution that we should allow the parties to choose. But I know in his heart that President Buhari will prefer a direct primary. But he is not going to be contesting. He has no interest in the next election.\n\n\u201cHe is in the position to be objective about this legislation. That is what he did. I think Nigerians should commend him for going against what he prefers in the interest of the country,\u201d el-Rufai added.\n\nSpeaking further on the APC crisis, the Kaduna State governor pointed out that the ruling party, like any political party, \u201cis an amalgam of the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d\n\nHe, also, pointed out that there \u201care people, who do not share the vision and outlook of President Buhari. There are some that are in this for what they can get. There are some that are in this for public service.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of every political party to manage these tendencies, suppress the base instincts and elevate the better instincts. We are going to that. The president was unhappy because we lost seven states we could have won under Adams Oshiomhole.\n\n\u201cThis is because of all kinds of problems in the management of the party. \u201cThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee is trying to sort these problems and unite the party. They have made some progress. They have brought some governors back to our party.\n\n\u201cThey have also engaged in intensive reconciliation. The Abdullahi Adamu Committee is working on reconciliation after the congresses. We have 36 states. After the congresses, we have intra-party crises in five states.\n\n\u201cThat is not significant. There are problems in Kano. There are problems in Kebbi. There are problems in Yobe? I have not heard of problems in Yobe. But there are problems in Zamfara. Really, I think we will sort out problems.\u201d\n\nDebunking the allegation that he would seek a joint presidential ticket with Fayemi, el-Rufai said he would not contest the 2023 presidential election on the ground that there was an understanding among the stakeholders that the presidency should be open to the south.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not ruling myself out because of that. I am saying that it is an understanding. I am a member of APC. Unless circumstances compel the APC of the South to come to us in the North and say we do not want it, then I can say it is now open for northerners.\n\n\u201cUntil then, I think there is a moral problem in trying to ignore what is clearly an understanding. This kind of agreement is the currency of politics. So, it is not about ruling myself out or whatever. I have never offered myself for that office. But I have been suspected of it since 2007.\u201d\n\nHe denied any plan to seek a joint ticket with Fayemi, noting that there \u201cis nothing like that. It is mere speculation. There are many speculations like that in the public. I want to assure you that it is nothing.\n\n\u201cFor me, Nigeria is at a critical juncture and we have many problems. I think Nigerians should look very closely and choose leaders that will address those problems no matter where they come from,\u201d el-Rufai explained.\n\nOn his part, Fayemi also argued that the president was an advocate of direct primary, pointing out that he had been a product of direct and indirect primary modes.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI have the honour of being the Chairman of the National Convention that produced Buhari as the candidate of our party in December 2014. Then, it was an indirect primary. It was a delegate primary. But in 2018 when he was seeking re-election, he emerged via a direct primary.\u201d\n\nOn this ground, he contended that Buhari \u201cis not an opponent of direct primary, neither is he the promoter of indirect primary. He outlined what he thought should be the approach, which as currently exists, resides with the political parties whether it is direct, indirect or consensus.\u201d\n\nFayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), warned against an assumption that direct primary \u201cis a cure or solution to whatever maleficence we feel exists about our democratisation process. Direct primary is obviously more inclusive. It is theoretically more inclusive.\n\n\u201cWhat we have also seen in Nigeria in the last two years of what we call direct primary does not suggest a cure. Look at the figures. We just had an election in Anambra State. We saw what happened there at my own party. We could not even muster the number our candidate had in the direct primary during the governorship election. We could not muster a quarter of it in the real election.\n\n\u201cThe direct primary so-called was the direct primary of its own members and not entire voters in the state. In the real election, however, we ended with a little above 40,000. Clearly, there is a mismatch that we need to address,\u201d he said.\n\nFayemi assured Nigerians that the president would sign the electoral bill if the National Assembly addressed the area of concern and transmitted it to the presidency before it was too late while faulting claims that Buhari and governors were not comfortable with the electronic transmission of election result clause.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you read his letter to the National Assembly, President Muhammadu only spoke about direct primary clause, meaning that if the clause is removed, I would not see any problem with the president signing a revised bill if transmitted on time.\n\n\u201cThe president has the mind of his own. Governors may have their views just as the members of the National Assembly have their views. I think what is important is president Buhari\u2019s commitment to the democratisation process.\n\n\u201cIf the National Assembly does the right thing by addressing the issue the president has raised in his response, I believe he will sign it. But they should do it quickly so that there is no time lag,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking on internal rivalries in the APC, Fayemi said any thriving living organisation would ordinarily undergo contention, claiming that there \u201cis nothing wrong in people having contention.\n\n\u201cIf you see a political party without tendencies, it is a dead organisation. I do not see any problem with people holding views that are contrary to the mainstream view in the party or that represent a body of opinion about how they feel,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, there are a lot of such views in the APC.\n\n\u201cWe applaud that. We cherish that. There should not be a problem with that as long as the big picture is not affected\u201d.\n\nBoth governor expressed optimism that the insecurity plaguing the country would soon be tackled.\n\nFor instance, expressing concern about issue, el-Rufai said it was becoming increasingly political, citing statements and utterances of some political leaders.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cone of the candidates for the 2019 elections said if Buhari was re-elected, banditry would get worse. Is that a prophecy? How did the candidate know what he was talking about? Is this rise in banditry fuelled by political consideration?\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, said banditry \u201cis a tipping point and it has to be crushed. We are going to see the end of it this year because we are not going into election with this level of insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a former general and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, we all know Buhari, his antecedents and how he invaded Chad when germdemes entered Borno State.\n\n\u201cAre some politicians fuelling this to discredit the president? Is this about 2023? Is it to say that APC failed to provide security so that it can be a campaign issue in 2023?\n\n\u201cI do not know. But there are many of us that analyse the utterances and statements of some political leaders around that time that we did not take quite seriously.\n\nFor Fayemi, the security challenges confronting Nigeria can be fixed within 17 months.\n\nAccording to the second-term governor, insecurity is affecting the rating of the regime of the president.\n\nFayemi also noted that security chiefs in the country know what to do to end banditry and other security challenges in the country.\n\nHe explained that not ending the security challenges within 17 months may mean that some people are benefitting from the \u201cwar economy.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we can destroy that monster of insecurity, the opinion in the country will change dramatically. If we decide to go after these people without too much attachment to human rights and issues that may come up from the international communities. these people are not ghosts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know where the bandits are, so we can neutralise them and then begin to have the opportunity. It may not be completely finished under this government, but you can do that part of it under this administration.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*May prevail on Atiku to accept BoT chairmanship\n\n*APC agreed after merger to rotate presidency, says Ngige\n\nChuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nSome governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have embarked on fresh move to zone the presidential ticket of the party in the 2023 general election to the South, in line with the position of the 17 southern governors that power should shift to the South in 2023, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAlso, in a first major endorsement for power shift by a member of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has expressed support for the emergence of a president from the southern part of the country, insisting that the All Progressives Congress (APC) agreed after merger to rotate presidency between North and the South.\n\nThis development is coming as the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu has enjoined Nigerians not to be hopeful of any meaningful change from the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration in 2022, saying the ruling party is bent on bringing more hardship to Nigerians.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that as part of the strategic consultations to realise this aspiration, some PDP governors had met with one of their colleagues in the North-east to help mount pressure on former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to accept the position of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the party.\n\nA source close to the governors and who is also privy to the new permutations in the main opposition party told THISDAY off-record that the incumbent chairman of the PDP BoT, Senator Walid Jubrin would be rounding off his tenure before the 2023 general election.\n\nThe PDP had zoned its national chairmanship ticket to the North, raising hopes that the presidential candidate would emerge from thesouthern part of the country.\n\nBut the body language of Atiku and some other chieftains of the party from the North has revealed that they are nursing the ambition to contest the position.\n\nHowever, the source told THISDAY that the PDP governors were working to prevail on Atiku to drop his ambition and allow power to shift to the South for the sake of justice and fairness.\n\nWhile acknowledging that Atiku is eminently qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election, the source added that the clamour for power shift and the issue of age could work against the former vice president.\n\n\u201cAtiku will be almost 77 years by 2023 as he is currently 75 years and that Nigerians may not accept such an old presidential candidate in view of the present circumstances of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cPDP gave Atiku the ticket in 2019 and may not be in a position to take the same gamble again.\n\n\u201cThe governors are thinking of allowing the former vice president to settle for the office of the chairman of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT),\u201d he explained.\n\nWith the popular agitation for power shift, the source further explained that the two leading political parties \u2013 PDP and APC may ensure the repeat of what happened in 1999 where the PDP and the then All Peoples Party (APP) produced two presidential candidates -Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and Chief Olu Falae from the South, to pacify the South-west over the annulment of the 1993 presidential election won by the late Chief MKO Abiola.\n\nAccording to the source, a repeat of the 1999 configuration would promote equity and fairness as well as address the agitation against marginalisation.\n\nHe noted that if power shifts to the South, the odds would favour the South-east geopolitical zone.\n\nHe explained that the PDP stakeholders were buying into the sentiments of ensuring equity and fairness to push for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the South.\n\nAccording to him, it is feared that if the PDP goes ahead to produce a presidential candidate outside of the southern states and the APC eventually ensures that it picks its presidential candidate from the south, the main opposition party will lose sympathy as many Nigerians will support APC to ensure the emergence of a president of southern extraction by 2023.\n\n\u201cIn whatever that we are doing, the continued unity of Nigeria should be taken into consideration. We are all aware of what happened in 1999 when the issue of June 12 threatened the nation.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now is more than the June 12 agitation because of the nepotism of the present administration. There must be a Nigeria before we talk of the 2023 general election. There must be unity before everything and everybody must reason on how best to assuage the heightened tension in the country. It will not be business as usual. We must make compromises,\u201d the source further explained.\n\nAPC Agreed after Merger to Rotate Presidency, Says Ngige\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Ngige, has expressed support for the emergence of a president from the southern part of the country in 2023.\n\nNgige who is a chieftain of the ruling APC, disclosed that the APC agreed after merger to rotate the presidency, stressing that that zoning and rotation of power create stability, unity, equity and progress of the country.\n\nAccording to him, rotation engenders confidence and patriotism and ensures that no one ethnic group or section of the country dominates the other.\n\nThe former Anambra State governor faulted those saying that no such convention exists.\n\nHe particularly berated the opposition PDP for waiting for APC to choose a southern presidential candidate, so that it can pick its candidate from the North in clear breach of the rotation convention and even against the rotation principle enshrined in the PDP constitution.\n\n\u201cTheir top apparatchik thinks they are smart. They want to play a fast one. They are waiting for APC to go to South. Their calculation is that when that happens, they will go to the North. Number one, that will be an act in bad faith because it will mean that they have taken the people in the South-south and South-east that have all along supported PDP 90 per cent in all the elections, for a ride.\n\n\u201cThe PDP will be shocked the way the South-east, the South-south and other minorities, and in fact, Nigerians as a whole will revolt. I was a founding member of the PDP. I was in its National Executive Committee as the Assistant National Secretary, South-east and served in many strategic standing committees. I was elected governor on the platform of the PDP. I know that the constitution of the PDP is clear on rotation of power and zoning of offices between the North and South.\n\n\u201cSo, if they are waiting for our great party the APC to choose a southern candidate so they can quickly turn and present a northern candidate at a point the dominant mood in the country is for power to shift to the South, then, they are deceiving themselves. Nigerians will shock them.\u201d\n\nA statement by the minister\u2019s media office in Abuja quoted Ngige as having made the assertions while answering questions from journalists at his country home in Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra State.\n\nNgige insisted that an unwritten agreement exists among politicians and political parties that rotation of offices should take place, adding that it was written down as a constitutional provision in the case of PDP.\n\nNgige noted that the issue of the rotation of the prime offices in the land is not expressly written in the constitution of APC, but insisted that the ruling party had agreed to rotate presidency after its merger.\n\n\u201cI was the secretary at our first convention and I took all the minutes. We had an agreement that our flag-bearer would come from the North and after North, it would go down to the South. So, those who are talking today were not there when this agreement was made. But was it written down and signed by politicians from both sides? No. But we had minutes of the meeting. They are there. It was agreed that there would be a movement between North and South.\n\n\u201cAs we were doing the convention and filling in offices, we narrowed down our candidates to about two or three. But, among the candidates, General Buhari was topping. All of us from the ACN caucus had agreed that he was our candidate. CPC had agreed that he would be their candidate. ANPP was split into two. So, when we went to the presidential convention, he emerged with a wide margin. That is the truth of the matter,\u201d Ngige explained.\n\nHe also argued that power rotation is contained in the 1999 constitution of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nHe said: \u201cFirst, Section 14 (3) of the constitution is clear on the composition of government at the national, states and even local government level, in such a way that there should be no actual or perceptions of domination by any single tribe or group of persons from one ethnic nationality so as to engender confidence and patriotism,\u201d he added.\n\nAPC Maladministration will Bring Sufferings to Nigerians, says Ayu\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the PDP, Ayu has alleged that the ruling APC is bent on making lives nasty, brutish and short for Nigerians in 2022.\n\nAyu, who stated this in a New Year message to Nigerians, however, promised that the reign of the APC was about to give way to a creditable government that would work in the interest of all.\n\nHe said: \u201cDo not expect anything better from the APC in 2022? They will still make your life nasty, brutish and short.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that all bad things come to an end. The hell that is APC will surely come to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nAyu stressed that to oust the ruling party, Nigerians of eligible age should register and vote in the 2023 general election to herald a new dawn.\n\n\u201cGo out and register. Get your voters\u2019 cards, mobilise and get this evil out of your lives. This is why 2022 is such an important year of hope for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the PDP, I wish you a hopeful New Year, a year that we all begin the journey for the liberation and rebuilding of Nigeria. So, help us God,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Angela, wife of the 52-year-old Assistant Superintendent of Police, Ojo Ayeni, crushed to death on a motorbike along Ado\u2013Ijan Road in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, by a van of the Rapid Response Squad of the Nigeria Police says the officers, who drove recklessly, were chasing suspected fraudsters otherwise known as 'Yahoo boys' when they hit the deceased.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Tuesday exclusively reported that Ayeni, who was riding on a bike, was crushed by the RRS van chasing suspected internet fraudsters from opposite direction.\n\n\u201cThe RRS operatives were in two Hilux vehicles chasing a Benz. I don\u2019t know where they were chasing the guys from, as they were about to overtake the Benz, the deceased who is popularly known as Baba Ada was coming from the other side and one of the vehicles hit him. He died immediately,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nHowever, spokesperson for the Ekiti Police Command, Sunday Abutu, in a statement on Wednesday shamelessly attacked SaharaReporters over the story.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe Ekiti State Police Command implores members of the public to disregard the news as it was not true but falsely fabricated to ridicule and dent the image of the Ekiti State Police Command and the Nigeria Police Force at large. See Also News Policeman Crushed To Death By Police Van Chasing \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019 In Ekiti To Be Buried Friday\n\n\u201cUpon the receipt of the report, the RRS Commander deployed three patrol vehicles with adequate operatives to that axis for the operation. Unfortunately, while on their way, one of the three patrol vehicles developed a mechanical fault, went off its lane and hit an oncoming motorcycle ridden by a policeman who had closed from work and was returning home.\n\n\u201cThe policeman was rushed to the hospital for medical attention but was confirmed dead by a medical doctor while eight other RRS operatives in the patrol vehicle sustained different degrees of injuries and are currently in the hospital receiving medical attention.\n\n\u201cIn view of this, the Ekiti State Police Command is at loss at the mental status of the Sahara Reporters that propagated the fake news. The reporter (from Sahara) did not patiently and professionally confirm the story but shamelessly chose to disrespect the life of the policeman that was lost while on national assignment. See Also Police Ekiti Police Shamelessly Attack SaharaReporters, Confirm Killing Of Officer By Patrol Van Chasing \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019\n\n\u201cSahara Reporters' action is very disgraceful, unfortunate, ungodly, inhuman and not in line with the practice of good journalism. Members of the public are, therefore, enjoined to disregard and discountenance the news and consider it as one of those fake news on the social media that are aimed at causing unnecessary tension, portraying the Nigeria Police Force in bad unpleasant garb and procreating an uprise against the force.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH, widow of the deceased and eyewitnesses said the officer was crushed by RRS operatives chasing \u2018Yahoo boys\u2019.\n\nAngele said, \u201cThat Tuesday morning, he dressed up and went to work. But at about 4:00pm, he took a bike and went to his project site where some people were working for him. When he got there, he paid the workers and rode to my shop nearby. We discussed and he said he would not eat as he was not feeling hungry. He said he was returning to work at his division and I said he should take care of himself. He left not knowing that it was the last time I would see him alive.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later, a commercial motorcycle rider came around and said a terrible accident had happened. He stated that some RRS operatives were pursuing some internet fraudsters (Yahoo boys) and in the process hit a policeman riding on a black bike. He said the accident was terrible and that the RRS operatives had put the policeman in their vehicle. I rushed there to confirm because my husband rode on a black bike when he came to my shop. See Also Police Identity Of Policeman Crushed To Death By Police Van Chasing \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019 In Ekiti, Revealed\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I saw the bike mangled. The RRS vehicle crossed from its lane to the other lane and hit my husband. I asked which hospital they took him to but nobody could say specifically until much later when I got wind that it was a police clinic. I went there to see him and take him to another hospital if need be for proper medical attention.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the police clinic, it was his lifeless body I saw at the back of the van. There was blood everywhere. I went there, cried, prayed, attempted to wake him and held the lifeless body to myself. Later, they said they would take him to the mortuary. I said I would do that, but they said no. I followed them to mortuary.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe woman, who said life would never be the same again without her husband, said the love they shared was great.\n\nShe also raised the alarm over her husband\u2019s phone, saying, \u201cWe have not recovered my husband\u2019s phone and it has since been switched off. The phone was in his pocket when he left my shop. One of the people who carried the body into the van must have taken his phone.\u201d",

          "text": "Angela, wife of the 52-year-old Assistant Superintendent of Police, Ojo Ayeni, crushed to death on a motorbike along Ado\u2013Ijan Road in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, by a van of the Rapid Response Squad of the Nigeria Police says the officers, who drove recklessly, were chasing suspected fraudsters otherwise known as 'Yahoo boys' when they hit the deceased.\n\nSaharaReporters had on Tuesday exclusively reported that Ayeni, who was riding on a bike, was crushed by the RRS van chasing suspected internet fraudsters from opposite direction.\n\n\u201cThe RRS operatives were in two Hilux vehicles chasing a Benz. I don\u2019t know where they were chasing the guys from, as they were about to overtake the Benz, the deceased who is popularly known as Baba Ada was coming from the other side and one of the vehicles hit him. He died immediately,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nHowever, spokesperson for the Ekiti Police Command, Sunday Abutu, in a statement on Wednesday shamelessly attacked SaharaReporters over the story.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe Ekiti State Police Command implores members of the public to disregard the news as it was not true but falsely fabricated to ridicule and dent the image of the Ekiti State Police Command and the Nigeria Police Force at large. See Also News Policeman Crushed To Death By Police Van Chasing \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019 In Ekiti To Be Buried Friday\n\n\u201cUpon the receipt of the report, the RRS Commander deployed three patrol vehicles with adequate operatives to that axis for the operation. Unfortunately, while on their way, one of the three patrol vehicles developed a mechanical fault, went off its lane and hit an oncoming motorcycle ridden by a policeman who had closed from work and was returning home.\n\n\u201cThe policeman was rushed to the hospital for medical attention but was confirmed dead by a medical doctor while eight other RRS operatives in the patrol vehicle sustained different degrees of injuries and are currently in the hospital receiving medical attention.\n\n\u201cIn view of this, the Ekiti State Police Command is at loss at the mental status of the Sahara Reporters that propagated the fake news. The reporter (from Sahara) did not patiently and professionally confirm the story but shamelessly chose to disrespect the life of the policeman that was lost while on national assignment. See Also Police Ekiti Police Shamelessly Attack SaharaReporters, Confirm Killing Of Officer By Patrol Van Chasing \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019\n\n\u201cSahara Reporters' action is very disgraceful, unfortunate, ungodly, inhuman and not in line with the practice of good journalism. Members of the public are, therefore, enjoined to disregard and discountenance the news and consider it as one of those fake news on the social media that are aimed at causing unnecessary tension, portraying the Nigeria Police Force in bad unpleasant garb and procreating an uprise against the force.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH, widow of the deceased and eyewitnesses said the officer was crushed by RRS operatives chasing \u2018Yahoo boys\u2019.\n\nAngele said, \u201cThat Tuesday morning, he dressed up and went to work. But at about 4:00pm, he took a bike and went to his project site where some people were working for him. When he got there, he paid the workers and rode to my shop nearby. We discussed and he said he would not eat as he was not feeling hungry. He said he was returning to work at his division and I said he should take care of himself. He left not knowing that it was the last time I would see him alive.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later, a commercial motorcycle rider came around and said a terrible accident had happened. He stated that some RRS operatives were pursuing some internet fraudsters (Yahoo boys) and in the process hit a policeman riding on a black bike. He said the accident was terrible and that the RRS operatives had put the policeman in their vehicle. I rushed there to confirm because my husband rode on a black bike when he came to my shop. See Also Police Identity Of Policeman Crushed To Death By Police Van Chasing \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019 In Ekiti, Revealed\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I saw the bike mangled. The RRS vehicle crossed from its lane to the other lane and hit my husband. I asked which hospital they took him to but nobody could say specifically until much later when I got wind that it was a police clinic. I went there to see him and take him to another hospital if need be for proper medical attention.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the police clinic, it was his lifeless body I saw at the back of the van. There was blood everywhere. I went there, cried, prayed, attempted to wake him and held the lifeless body to myself. Later, they said they would take him to the mortuary. I said I would do that, but they said no. I followed them to mortuary.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe woman, who said life would never be the same again without her husband, said the love they shared was great.\n\nShe also raised the alarm over her husband\u2019s phone, saying, \u201cWe have not recovered my husband\u2019s phone and it has since been switched off. The phone was in his pocket when he left my shop. One of the people who carried the body into the van must have taken his phone.\u201d",

When it became obvious that the security men were going overboard, the CP, after about 30 minutes humiliation, ordered the arrest of four of the security men, leaving one.\n\n\u201cHowever, in order not to make the Estate porous, the Commissioner of Police immediately posted well-armed policemen at the gate to support the security man left behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA few minutes later, a female resident of the Estate later identified as Adebola Fatiregun who didn\u2019t witness the incident but heard of it, stormed the gate in anger, inciting other residents against the Commissioner of Police and his aides.\n\n\u201cShe was also arrested for inciting violence and conduct likely to cause a breach of peace.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesman said all those arrested were taken to the Isheri police division where they made statements, but were released minutes after following the intervention of \u201cnotable individuals\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome residents of the Estate, in solidarity with the arrested security men, deliberately closed the gate, thereby creating a temporary gridlock. This they did after the CP had left, perhaps to blackmail him and make him release the security men,\u201d Ajisebutu added.",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Autochek, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup scene has seen continued progress year on year. After a slight setback in 2020, courtesy of the coronavirus and the ensuing lockdown, activities have resumed as usual \u2014 well, almost.\n\nAs the year ends, we bring you a few memorable moments across the African tech ecosystem, some good and some bad.\n\nMore African investors throw their hats in the ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKola Aina, pioneer founder Ventures Platform fund\n\nFor so long, most of the investment into African startups came from foreign investors. Make no mistake, that is still the case. However, more African investors are springing up and providing much-needed funding for African startups.\n\nThis year saw PiggyVest\u2019s Co-founder, Odunayo Eweniyi team up with Eloho Omame to start FirstCheck, an African firm funding startups founded by women. Seasoned investor and early PiggyVest investor, Olumide Soyombo, launched Voltron Capital; LoftyInc Capital launched its third fund of $10 million. Ventures Platform recently announced the first close of its $40 million fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany founders also invested in startups themselves or as part of a collective, with Flutterwave\u2019s Founder, Olugbenga Agboola; Paystack\u2019s Co-founders, Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi; and Babs Ogundeyi, Founder and CEO of Kuda Bank some of the founders to do so.\n\nAll this points to a better understanding of the dynamics of funding tech startups by local investors and would help support more innovators on the continent. We\u2019re excited to see how this plays out.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crypto ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a broken payment infrastructure, many Nigerians took to cryptocurrencies to navigate global financial systems.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government of Nigeria was having none of it. Through the Central Bank of Nigeria, it issued a circular in February instructing commercial banks and other licensed financial institutions to stop facilitating transactions for cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.\n\nThere was a brief period when it seemed users of cryptocurrencies were going to capitulate, but they were only regrouping with peer to peer transactions increasing as a result.\n\nThe year of the unicorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nAs the year started, Africa had only one unicorn. As of December, it now boasts five fintech startups as OPay, Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, and talent outsourcing company, Andela, joined Interswitch as the continent\u2019s unicorns.\n\nFlutterwave led the way when it raised $170 million in a Series C round in March, bringing its total funding to $225 million.\n\nOPay was the next with a $400 million raise that took its valuation way past the $1 billion mark and made it the fastest African startup to cross the $1 billion valuation mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy September, Andela became the latest unicorn after Softbank led a $200 million Series E round in the talent outsourcing startup. Chipper Cash rounded up the list as Africa\u2019s seventh unicorn raising a $150 million extension round. This followed its $100 million Series C raise in May.\n\nTwitter\u2019s first African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nNigeria\u2019s frequent fight with Ghana continued this year, and this time, it was not over who had the better jollof rice but over Twitter\u2019s decision to set up its first African office in Ghana.\n\nThe decision to set up in Ghana was a surprise to many after comments made by Twitter\u2019s then CTO (now CEO), Parag Agrawal, during a 2019 visit to Nigeria.\n\nDuring the visit, Agrawal commented on the availability of technical talents in Nigeria and impactful public conversations.\n\nThe roles it began hiring for also indicate that the plan might have been to set up in Nigeria with the company listing free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet as its reasons for choosing Ghana.\n\nThe Nigerian Startup Bill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nBuilding a startup in Nigeria means occasionally pulling all-nighters as you try to figure out how to surmount the latest regulatory hurdle. For so long, it has been argued that Nigerian startup founders need to be proactive in their interactions with the government and regulators.\n\nAs a result, some of the country\u2019s most prominent founders and investors came together to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill. The Bill seeks to set a framework of interaction between the Nigerian startup community and the government to enable startups to thrive.\n\nHowever, this is not the first of such initiatives, and few people expressed scepticism about it. However, it seems plans are on track, with TechCabal reporting that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council has approved the bill.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether things work better this time around, but we hope they do.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter ban\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, June 2, 2021, microblogging platform, Twitter, deleted tweets made by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari. According to Twitter, the decision resulted from the President\u2019s violation of its abusive behaviour policy.\n\nTwo days later, on June 4, 2021, the federal government responded by banning the use of the microblogging platform in Nigeria, forcing Nigerians to access Twitter using VPNs. Over the next few months, the federal government disclosed a willingness to lift the ban, provided Twitter agreed to some conditions.\n\nIn August, the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, hinted that the ban would be lifted \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d It\u2019s been over four months now, and the ban is still in place.\n\nFrancophone Africa gets its first unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil this year, all of Africa\u2019s tech unicorns had been founded in predominantly English speaking countries. But in September, Wave broke that monopoly, becoming the first francophone Africa unicorn. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it came from the fintech sector.\n\nThe startup became a unicorn after it raised $200 million in Africa\u2019s largest Series A round to date. Founded by Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, Wave launched in Senegal in 2017, offering free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application while charging users a 1% fee for money transfers.\n\nIts low-cost solution has enabled it to take on more established players in Senegal, with Orange, the country\u2019s largest mobile money operator, reportedly going as far as stopping its Senegalese users from purchasing Orange airtime using Wave\u2019s application.\n\nRecord-breaking rounds for Egyptian startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was the year of Egyptian startups. Last year, startups in the country raised $156 million, but by August 2021, they had eclipsed those figures. As of September, startups in the country had raised over $400 million in 2021.\n\nConsequently, it now rivals Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa as the continents top investment destinations.\n\nAlready, the country has one startup valued above $1 billion in Fawry and could have two when Swvl lists publicly. According to Disrupt Africa\u2019s Egyptian Startup Ecosystem Report 2021, this year, Egypt is behind only Nigeria in terms of funding raised by its startups. However, unlike most startup powerhouses on the continent, Egypt\u2019s most prominent startups are in eCommerce instead of fintech.\n\nMainOne\u2019s impending acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunke Opeke. Founder/CEO, MainOne\n\nLast year, telecommunications service provider, MainOne, celebrated its 10th anniversary. This year, reports have emerged that the company is in talks to be acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nIt is fair to say that the news was one few, if any, were expecting as Nigerians made their feelings known on Twitter. A central talking point was the rumoured cost of the transaction, with some of the opinion that the company was underpriced.\n\nHowever, Funke Opeke, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO, quashed such suggestions in an interview with TechCrunch. According to her, while MainOne has raised money since its founding, not all of it has been equity raises, with the company also raising debt rounds.\n\nAt $320 million, this is the highest any Nigerian tech company has acquired. Throw in the fact that this is a female-led company, and you can see how impressive it is.\n\nNigeria\u2019s surprising 5G auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s road to getting 5G has thrown up some surprises, but none has been more surprising than one of the recently concluded 5G auction winners \u2014 MAFAB Communications.\n\nUntil the bids were announced, very little was known about MAFAB Communications or its operations. However, it surprisingly beat Airtel to become one of two holders of Nigeria\u2019s 5G licence. For context, the company was only incorporated on July 8, 2020, but managed to edge out older and more established players.\n\nAs we step into the new year, we do so with excitement at what is to come, and we hope you had an amazing year.\n\nMerry Christmas, and a happy new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween January and September 2021, African fintechs raised up to $1.4 billion, signalling an increasing investor appetite for Africa\u2019s growing fintech space, and Nigeria has taken centre stage.\n\nWhen Paystack and Flutterwave launched in 2016, it was a massive game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s financial sector, enabling thousands of other businesses to receive payments for their services.\n\nSince then, each year has presented an interesting trend as people look to plug different perceived gaps in Nigeria\u2019s financial sector.\n\nAccording to data gathered by Intelligence by Techpoint, Nigerian fintech startups raised almost $800 million in 2021. This was 120% higher than what fintechs raised in the last three years combined ($360.7 million).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, it took the lion\u2019s share of funding across sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this success, our analysis showed that fintechs were merely scratching the surface of financial inclusion in Africa. But, so far, there\u2019ve been massive improvements in the fintech space beyond smartphone apps.\n\nLooking back at 2021, we touch on some notable points, and, once again, we had the honour of discussing the space with Adedeji Olowe, Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nIn January 2021, Olowe made some interesting predictions which, in the real sense, are educated guesses based on the trends from past years, and we created a little analysis.\n\nInterestingly, some predictions came to pass, reminding us that no one sees the future. At least, we haven\u2019t met anyone who does, have you?\n\nWhat did not happen?\n\nVisa and Mastercard to acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, we placed what was perhaps the most daring and exciting prediction front and centre in our analysis of Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions. Visa could acquire Interswitch with Mastercard responding by acquiring eTranzact.\n\nThis obviously did not happen, but several building blocks are in place to make it possible.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Visa invested $200 million in Interswitch, making one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech companies a full-fledged Unicorn. That investment brought several conversations about Visa\u2019s play for the Nigerian market, and that of its biggest competition, Mastercard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth companies have invested in many Nigerian fintechs, most notably Paystack and Flutterwave, and seemingly took their battle for market share to Africa\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cI made the prediction because I think it made perfect sense for both companies to go through that route, and I think it\u2019s still a possibility in the future,\u201d says Olowe.\n\nMajor banks to implement free transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest selling points Digital banks like Kuda have used to take the market by storm is free transfers. Unfortunately, no major bank took up the gauntlet to implement free bank transfers in 2021.\n\nAccording to Olowe, giving free transfers for transactions below a certain amount would greatly aid Nigeria\u2019s drive for a cashless society. This, he says, would bring in several people performing low-value transactions daily.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s something the CBN should push for. Over 20 years ago, a SIM card cost \u20a620,000, but now it\u2019s completely free. Today, some people don\u2019t mind buying \u20a650 recharge cards ten times in a day, but tell them to load \u20a6500 at once,\u201d he states.\n\nOlowe believes that once a cap is set, it would be very helpful and will not be abused.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling people to send their own hard-earned money. Even if it\u2019s free, It won\u2019t be so easy. If the accounts are linked with the BVN, then it would be easier to catch those who might want to abuse the policy,\u201d he argues.\n\nCould we see another game-changing CBN circular soon? Let\u2019s watch out.\n\nMonthly inter-bank transactions to hit $500 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fintech stalwarts tout Nigeria\u2019s payment sector as one of the fastest globally. This was made possible by the introduction of the NIBSS Instant Payment by the Nigerian Inter-Bank Settlement System. This speed, as well as several other factors like increasing Internet penetration, has increased monthly inter-bank transactions in recent years.\n\nAs of December 2020, the numbers had almost hit $300 million, but so far, in 2021, it hasn\u2019t come close to $500 million.\n\nAccording to data from the NIBSS, the average monthly inter-bank transactions stayed a little over $250 million for the better part of 2021, finally crossing $300 million in October and November.\n\n\u201cTransactions will likely go up during the festive season, but I doubt it will hit $400 million.\u201d\n\nIt stands to reason that free inter-bank transfers could encourage more inter-bank transactions, but it might not always be so straightforward. Let\u2019s watch out for any triggers in 2022.\n\nWhatsApp to make a payment play in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, all it would have taken was a virtual account attached to every WhatsApp number, and that would have been a game-changer, Olowe opined in January 2021. However, WhatsApp payment struggled to lift off during the year.\n\nIts launch in Brazil met with stiff opposition, and regulatory parties all but quelled any traction it plans to gain. However, the team at Meta-owned WhatsApp is not deterred, and it announced a relaunch in Brazil and testing in the United States in December 2021.\n\nOlowe believes they\u2019re not out yet, stating that future developments would most likely tie in with Meta\u2019s recent crypto play.\n\nImagine being able to make transactions from a crypto wallet in your WhatsApp account. That would be something, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSignificant progress\n\nThe growth and relevance of agency banking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency banking burst onto the scene in 2020 with the reported successes of OPay and TeamApt. In 2021, it grew to unprecedented levels as more players like Kudi and Paga began to show immense growth in Agency banking services.\n\nOlowe predicted that Agency banking locations would surpass one million. Though we tried collating data from different players, this could amount to double-counting as most agents are company agnostic. So we\u2019ll try to lay our hands on official data.\n\nIn January, Olowe argued that if KYC issues were resolved, most agents would be able to perform services such as offering loans, customer KYC verification, e-commerce deliveries, and other non-cash transactions.\n\nThis idea has not been fully realised, but some of the players in the space have made some significant strides.\n\nTeamApt, OPay, and Paga, for example, offer bill payments and other social services, but a little talked about company, Kudi, has struck some interesting initiatives.\n\nIn August 2021, it revealed a partnership with Aella App and Reliance HMO to allow customers access loans and health insurance through their network of agents.\n\nYou see, mobile money providers do not have the licence to provide loans or insurance, but that\u2019s where Aella comes in to provide loans to customers, and Reliance comes in for health insurance.\n\nAccording to Nifemi Akinwamide, Head of Marketing at Kudi, the goal is to bring millions of Nigerians who are offline into the financial market, and such a partnership would help Aella and Reliance reach thousands of people who do not have smartphones.\n\nThis deserves a closer look, and its success might help make this prediction get a more favourable outcome in 2022\n\nWhat happened\n\nMTN finally got its PSB licence\n\nIn January, Olowe stated that MTN would finally get its PSB licence, and he based his prediction on the fact that Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO, who has a history of execution, would make it happen.\n\nAt the MTN anniversary event, we tried getting some juice from Toriola, but he simply stated that the company had completed all the requirements and was waiting for the CBN\u2019S final decision.\n\nIn November 2021, MTN and Airtel finally received approval in principle (AIP) to operate as a payment service bank in Nigeria. They joined 9mobile and Glo that got the AIP in 2019.\n\nWhile a telco-driven mobile money operation has worked wonders in Kenya and Ghana, it has not hit the mark in Nigeria.\n\nMost mobile money providers use PoS machines that require cards and mainly deal with cash, but a telco-led mobile money could make things completely cashless.\n\n\u201cAn AIP gives many financial institutions the power to operate fully. They\u2019re basically telling you to put actions behind all you\u2019ve been boasting that your company would do. They\u2019ll then come back in a few years to see that everything is functioning well.\n\n\u201cI must admit that MTN would find it really tough to play in the financial space. They would have two regulators, the NCC and the CBN, and would experience what banks and other fintechs have been facing in the space,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHowever, he also insists that MTN has a track record of execution, and they would come with the right strategy to take the market.\n\nMTN is the largest telecom company in terms of network coverage, voice subscribers, and Internet subscribers, and the launch of its PSB could bode well for financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nVirtual accounts are coming of age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe predicted that virtual accounts, led by innovators from TeamApt, Rubies, Zenith, Sterling, Wema, and Sparkle would become increasingly popular.\n\nSo far, most of these fintech companies have led the charge as predicted, but not without a few hiccups.\n\nWhen the CBN banned crypto transactions in March 2021, it placed sanctions on Providus Bank, which enabled virtual accounts for several fintech companies playing in the crypto space.\n\nHowever, the issues have since been resolved, and Olowe states that activities have resurged to the levels attained just before the crypto ban.\n\nLocal investors are stepping up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports from previous years showed that foreign investments have dominated funding for Nigerian startups, and Olowe predicted that this would change with the FOMO caused by Paystack\u2019s acquisition in 2020.\n\nRecall that Stripe acquired Paystack in 2020 for $200 million, a truly momentous milestone for Africa\u2019s startup scene.\n\nIn 2021, there\u2019s been a massive improvement in the participation of local investors, but differently than expected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that several Nigerian investors don\u2019t really understand the business of startups. They think it\u2019s just, \u2018Put your money and expect constant returns.\u2019 What we\u2019re now seeing is startup founders who truly understand the space funding upcoming founders,\u201d Olowe points out.\n\nRecent funding rounds have featured the likes of GB, Flutterwave CEO; Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi, Paystack\u2019s Co-founders; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO, and other notable names.\n\nOlowe, however, maintains that Nigeria has boasted a good number of local investors in recent years. Most notable are Gbenga Oyebode, Founder of Aluko and Oyebode, one of MTN\u2019s first supporters in Nigeria.\n\nOther names like Idris Ayobello and Olumide Soyombo also warrant significant mention.\n\nAccording to Olowe, the successes of three investors has created FOMO among their peers who are getting more interested in the startup space.\n\nIt was a bright year for fintech companies and a year of Unicorns.

          "title": "How Nigerian banks frustrate cash trapped customers",
          "text": "Customers of Nigerian banks have decried the inability of the lenders to make cash available on the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and even online transfers when needed.\n\nThis, however, has been attributed to operational problems rather than liquidity issues as some analysts believe that if such persists, the financial inclusion drive of the central bank would be at risk.\n\nAt the convenience of her home in Amuwo Odofin, Lagos, a middle-aged woman used the USSD code of her bank to transfer N100,000 to a customer with a UBA account on December 18, 2021 but was not successful.\n\nThe response she received after initiating the transaction was, \u201cyour account is restricted please dial *737*20*BVN# or visit any GTBank branch to link your BVN to your account.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was sure that her account had been linked to her BVN, however, followed the instruction, only to receive another response, which read, \u201cYour account is already linked to your account. Dial *568*0# to confirm your BVN.\u201d\n\nOn different occasions at Lagos Island, customers were seen moving from one ATM machine to the other in search of cash but were disappointed.\n\nThe response displayed by one of the ATMs of a first-generation bank was, \u201cthis transaction cannot be completed\u201d and the second ATM machine said \u201cno service.\u201d\n\nIt was either the ATM machines of commercial banks around Marina area of Lagos that could not dispense cash or the cash transactions were delayed due to network issues.\n\nSome banks\u2019 ATM machines visited randomly by BusinessDay during the festive period were the ones owned by First Bank of Nigeria, GTBank, UBA, FCMB, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Polaris Bank, among others.\n\nResponding to the development, Muda Yusuf, CEO, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), said this may slightly be a technology issue, noting, \u201cI believe that it is a question of the banks strengthening their technology capacity to be able to handle some of these transactions.\u201d\n\nHe said quite a lot of transactions were taking place online these days, adding that the use of cash was getting lower.\n\nRead also: CBN\u2019s interventions drive banks\u2019 credit to private sector growth\n\nAs more transactions migrate online or through electronic channels, he said the capacity of channels needs to be strengthened so that some of the downtime, failure of PoS, failure of ATMs, network collapsing in the banks, and all that would be reduced.\n\n\u201cI think it is a technology issue. So, we have to engage the banks to make sure that they invest a lot more in technology, and we also need to appeal to the government to support the telcos who are providing the backbone for some of these technologies to happen.\n\n\u201cSomething like the fibre optic cables and technology. All of these things are very important ICT infrastructure that other sectors of the economy need. But as for cash, I am not sure that there is any bank that is insolvent. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any bank that is distressed. So, people are not able to get cash because there is a challenge with technology,\u201d Yusuf told BusinessDay.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said a key focus of the central bank under his leadership had been enabling the build-out of a robust payment system that will provide cheap, efficient, and faster means of conducting payments for most Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWith the growing pace of digitisation globally, it is essential that we leverage digital channels in fulfilling this objective,\u201d he said.\n\nTotal transaction volumes using digital channels more than doubled between 2018 and 2020, as volumes rose from 1.3 billion to over 3.3 billion financial transactions in 2020. Digital payment channels, he said, also help to support the continued conduct of business activities during the lockdown.\n\n\u201cOur robust payment system has continued to evolve towards meeting the needs of households and businesses in Nigeria. Reflecting the confidence in our payment system, between 2015 and September 2021, about $900 million has been invested in firms run by Nigerian founders,\u201d Emefiele said.",

          "title": "How Nigerians can sing a new song in 2022",
          "text": "It was endless back-slapping yesterday as Nigerians joined the rest of the world to wish one another a happy new year and general goodwill. But the good wishes of new songs would, to a large extent, depend on what the socio-economic and political firmament would look like; observers told BusinessDaySunday.\n\nThe out-gone year was hell for many citizens on all fronts.\n\nIf one considers the realities on the ground, especially the economic downturn, a new song might elude Nigerians this New Year, except things are consciously done differently by the government and the people.\n\nAs much as the country and her citizens, who were battered by intense hardship, escalating insecurity, and the lingering impact of the pandemic, yarn for respite from their agonies of 2021, it is only a concerned government, which is ready to walk its talk that can make a new song possible and louder in 2022.\n\nMany concerned Nigerians and observers think that the country can bounce back in her economy, security, as well as, overcome other challenges if the leadership is determined to walk its talk, at least, for the first time.\n\nStarting from the base, observers argue that if the government had given license to many investors to build refineries, given them deadlines, monitor the projects, and offer them other incentives, the fear of subsidy removal by the middle of this year and the consequent hike in prices would have been averted.\n\n\u201cWeather Nigerians will sing a new song or not depends on our government. Ordinarily, coming out of 2021 was a miracle because of the hardship that overstretched Nigerians. It was a year when prices of goods tripled in just one month, a year that more Nigerians fell under poverty threshold and a year that many will curse if allowed,\u201d Paul Oghenkor, a lawyer and Lagos landlord, said.\n\nLamenting further, the landlord said: \u201cConsidering the debt pile, a sensitive government will not borrow again, rather manage and look for ways to stimulate the economy, get many entrepreneurs back on track and encourage companies rather than kill them with stifling policies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a new song is possible if government walks its talk on the diversification of the economy, recover the billions of Naira lost to gas flaring every day in the Niger Delta, open other seaports to importers of bulk goods to reduce the cost of transportation to final destinations, which impact prices, and encourage investors in technology companies and creative industry.\n\n\u201cWe all know that oil prices have never been stable for a long time now and will not in the future. So, we need to consciously develop other sectors of the economy to boost revenue. If Hollywood is raking billions of dollars for the United States of America\u2019s economy, Nollywood can do the same if encouraged and supported,\u201d Oghenkor said.\n\nExpressing his views on diversification of the economy as a means of salvaging the country this year, Nkereuwem Onung, president, Federation of Tourism Associations of Nigeria (FTAN), insisted that tourism offers diverse opportunities, amid huge capacity for employment.\n\nHe also noted that the umbrella body of tourism practitioners in Nigeria has credible members who are willing to partner with others for sustainable development of tourism in a way that it will earn foreign exchange and huge revenue for the country like some destinations such as Dubai, South Africa, Kenya, France, and Spain.\n\nThe same view was shared by Patrick Utomi, founder, Centre for Values in Leadership (CVL) and political economist, while as a keynote speaker at the annual general meeting of the National Association of Tour Operators (NATOP) in Calabar, recently.\n\nUtomi disclosed that tourism was the lowest hanging fruit for economic diversification due to its easy entry, it does not require huge capital investment and grows profit easily.\n\nFor him, the government can identify credible stakeholders in the tourism industry to partner with for sustainable tourism development projects that can impact the economy within a short period, though long-term investment in the sector is also necessary.\n\nThe professor observed that in Nigerian tourism, there seems to be a missing link, especially in a diversified economy, hence the need to train and direct Nigerian tourism stakeholders on better ways of marketing Nigerian as a tourism destination.\n\nDimifa Alagha, an investment banker with StanbicIBTC, pointed out that the prevailing policies in the country do not support investments, especially foreign direct investments, and that the government needs to change such policies in order to attract investors this year, who will help stimulate the economy.\n\n\u201cIn economies like Nigeria, it is the SMEs that are the backbone of the economy, but the policies and the business environment have not been favorable for them. If you want a better 2022, the government should consciously pull the SMEs out of the brick and the lingering impact of the pandemic. Again, the government should intervene with soft loans because high-interest rates, impossible collateral, and low purchasing power are challenging SMEs now more than before,\u201d Alagha said.\n\nThe investment banker argued that the government cannot pressure SMEs with unfavorable policies, amid multiple taxations and still expect the economy to improve this year.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired of promises, the government should learn from other economies that pass through a similar experience and how they managed to stabilise their economies. It is not all about loans and obeying World Bank orders, it is about finding what works for us and implementing them, loans do not work for us, they mortgaged our future,\u201d he said.\n\nHannah Irem, a mother of three and businesswoman, thinks that 2022 will be better if the government is sincere with the masses, and also avoid price hikes in fuel pump price, electricity tariff and other things that induce inflation.\n\n\u201cDo not promise what you cannot fulfill; do not increase something you cannot reduce, leave us to manage until when a messiah will come. You want to increase fuel price as if the masses are the reason the refineries are not working,\u201d she said.\n\nLai Omotola, group managing director, Masters Reality International Concepts Limited (MRICL), and chancellor of E-Boot Camp Limited, said that for those in business, like himself, to sing a new song this year, the government must try to reduce the hassles associated with doing business in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe economy remains very vital to our welfare and indeed affects all aspects of our lives. This is why everybody wants to know how the economy is doing. There are certain indices that people look at to know how the economy is doing. What are those indices for the economy? Number one is inflation, which has accelerated fast and it is now 15.99 percent. Inflation of double-digit means that we need to raise the serious alarm.\n\n\u201cAnother one is the exchange rate which is at N575 to the dollar and you look at what was the exchange rate in 2015. Then, you look at the size of the economy in terms of the GDP which is at $440 billion. This for a giant of Africa is little. When you look at the budget size for 2022 is N16 trillion. The question is how are we going to spend the budget? The government is saying that there is going to be a deficit of N6.3 trillion out of the N16 trillion.\n\n\u201cWhat is the deficit? It means that we have a budget but we do not have enough money to cover it and we are going to borrow N6.3 trillion either from domestic or foreign. So, that begins to raise a flag. We are even budgeting beyond what we produce, which is a no from day one but they say we need to continue that way otherwise the economy will shut down.\u201d\n\nAccording to Omotola, \u201cWhen one looks at the budget to find out what we are spending money on, you will find out that out of the N16 trillion, we are spending N6.8 trillion on recurrent expenditure, which is close to 30 percent of the budget. On personnel cost, we will be spending N4.11trillion. Then, the question is which government parastatal in Nigeria can one enjoy excellent customer care service. Can one have a good experience at General Hospital, Passport Office or Police despite the amount spent annually on personnel cost?\n\n\u201cAnother question is- where is this money coming from? The budget says that 80 percent of the funding will come from oil. This means that for the past 60 years that we have been talking about diversification, we still remain in the same place.\n\n\u201cNigerian oil still provides 95 percent of foreign exchange and 80 percent of budgetary revenue. This means that Nigeria still remains a mono-economy. So, 20 years of democracy plus 32 years of military dictatorship, have not shifted us forward but we have gone backward.\u201d\n\nOmotola, who is a real estate player, told BusinessDaySunday that unless Nigeria begins to implement her ideas and policies, the new song may not be possible for the country this year.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to achieve a turnaround in her economy and record the desired change, the country must be looking not only for an ideas man but for an executioner that can say that the Niger Bridge, for instance, will be ready on October 1, 2022, and it will be so. An executioner will say that the three refineries in Warri, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna will be ready by 2023, and it will be.\n\n\u201cUntil Nigeria finds that executioner, our journey will still continue to manifest the way it has always been. It is now about executing ideas rather than giving talk shows, and seminars. We usually say that leadership is the problem of this country but we have now realised that human capital drain is totally on the increase and worse than leadership. This means that there is a vacuum of knowledge. Scarcity of knowledge is one of the reasons why we are where we are today.\u201d\n\nHumphrey Bamisebi Olumakaiye, diocesan bishop of Lagos and archbishop, Ecclesiastical Province of Lagos, urged both the leaders and the led to work positively for the good of the nation and the citizenry.\n\nAccording to Olumakaiye, \u201cEach New Year offers a blank sheet of rewriting history and changing the narrative. It is God\u2019s benevolent gift of time to etch our footprints in the sand of history. Indeed, New Year is a new window of opportunity to be a better person in character, disposition, and attitude. With the arrival of another 365 days comes another door of hope to rise from the shadow and shine the light in an ever-increasingly dark world. Therefore, the desire of the Lord Almighty is that we should all seize the moment and embrace this gift of time with resolute determination. The chance to make the right impact is for all and on all; for leaders and followers; for men and women; for boys and girls \u2013 without discrimination and partiality.\u201d",

          "text": "The year 2022 is the eve of the 2023 general election when the 18 recognised political parties will be conducting primaries to field candidates for the various offices.\n\nPoliticians are expected to increase their desperation in their quest for various elective positions in the months to come.\n\nThey are already in deft moves to position themselves for electoral victories.\n\nAs expected, there would be alignment and realignment of forces through the common option available to many Nigerian politicians; defection from one political party to another and even merger or formation of new political parties as the Independent National Electoral Commissioner (INEC) recently disclosed that over 100 associations have applied to be made political parties.\n\nExperts predicted that there would be a rise in political activities, more defections, and establishment of new political parties in 2022, as they called for zoning of offices to checkmate marginalisation; and more youth inclusiveness, as well as living above board by INEC, the umpire.\n\nChristian Okeke, lecturer in the Department of Political Science in a Nigerian university, told BusinessDaySunday that Nigerians should expect a phenomenal rise in political activities, as the next general election draws nearer.\n\nHe said that there would be political alignments, defections, campaigns, membership drive, and so forth, noting that political noise is expected to dominate the geo-political space, while there will be much political drama and thuggery.\n\n\u201cSadly, all manner of negative political participations, which characterised previous elections may still rear their ugly heads because it appears the process has not been cleaned up the way it is supposed to be. So, a lot is expected to happen in the area of politicking this year,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the International Relations scholar, the year 2022 and the forthcoming 2023 general election are going to put INEC on the spot as a lot is expected of the Commission as its integrity and independence would be put on trial.\n\n\u201cOf course, the electoral umpire has an opportunity to write its name in gold or mess up everything. Whether INEC will save our democracy or become an accomplice to collapse will be a concern for Nigerians. Bearing that in mind, it is expected that INEC goes beyond its usual mantra of \u2018we are ready for the election\u2019 to really tackle anticipated logistic and technical failures.\n\n\u201cMany people still expect that INEC\u2019s bimodal machines will fail on election day. As a result, it is up to the Commission to prove the naysayers wrong by test-running the machines ahead of the polls and going further to ensure that whatever would cause a hitch is nipped in the bud. Recruitment and training of ad-hoc staff are expected this year, so is the issue that has to do with security during the election. So, INEC has its hands full this year,\u201d Okeke said.\n\nHe also called on the electorate to play their role very well by turning out en masse to cast their votes, remain peaceful, and protect their votes, especially if security and credibility of the process are guaranteed.\n\n\u201cI expect to see a large turn out on the election day because of many things that have happened between 2015 and now, except insecurity does not allow the electorate to show up at polling units,\u201d the former journalist said.\n\nRead also: 2023 Election: Senator calls for equity\n\nWhile backing the agitations for power shift from the North to the South, Okeke said: \u201cI support that power must shift to the South and South-East in particular. Actually, to clean the mess in the polity will not take north or south politics to be done. It is a very herculean task that awaits the next president because things have really gone bad. Don\u2019t forget that insecurity alone is hydra-headed and multi-dimensional, not to talk of other challenges like poverty, poor education system, decayed infrastructure, hyperinflation, and other internal contradictions.\n\n\u201cHowever, allowing power to shift will address one of the perennial challenges in the system, which is injustice. There is a need for fair play, equity, and fairness in the political calculations leading to the next election. Anything short of that will further draw the country backward and create more problems. After 2023 and the end of whatever tenure those to be elected will have, we can talk about shifting to the marginalised ethnic groups in the north and so on.\u201d\n\nHe expressed worry that there are no signs that youths will be given a chance in 2023 yet as the political elites have already skewed the process to perfectly and cunningly exclude the youths.\n\n\u201cThink about the over N20 million nomination and expression of interest forms, how many youths can afford that? Has all the former this and that told you that they are retiring from politics for good? Youths beg them for virtually everything and the 2023 general election will not be an exception. They may allow a few youths in but bet me, the ratio will still be wide, comparatively.\n\n\u201cThe implication of excluding the youths is that the country keeps going in the same circle of infamy. Imagine a country that excludes her youths in governance? There is nothing that will make it not continue to become a laughing stock and wallow in underdevelopment,\u201d the political scientist said.\n\nIdayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), Abuja, said Nigerians would see many politicians who lose out during the National Convention of either the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2021 and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2022 defecting to other parties or establishing new parties.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian election is 14 months away with the electoral management body, INEC officially releasing the timetable for the elections. 2022 will herald the official commencement of campaigns for the politicians. In fact, for most elected government officials, all emphasis will be on campaigns against governance.\n\n\u201cNigeria as it currently stands is already battling with disinformation, we can expect to see an increase in the disinformation produced in a bid to delegitimize opponents, parties, ethnic and religious groups,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nShe noted that INEC would not just be planning for elections but unfortunately will be faced by fake news from all quarters in an attempt to discredit the Commission and it will at the same time be planning a difficult election as the level of insecurity in the country increases.\n\n\u201cThis time around, it is not just the Boko Haram insurgency but also the banditry in the North West, the South East impasse just to mention a few. We need to reflect deeply on the difficulty in putting the Anambra election together.\n\n\u201cAll the challenges currently being faced by the country have made it imperative for citizens to do beyond voting based on primordial sentiments. This time, the citizens must ask what are they voting for, roads, security, electricity and not for N5000 and suffering for the next four years. I believe as Nigerians we have finally learnt that votes do have consequences,\u201d she said.\n\nThe democracy and development expert opined that zoning is important as it balances the winner-take-it-all political system, saying if not for zoning, moneybags and majority ethnic groups would control the government at all levels.\n\nShe emphasised that: \u201cAt this point in history, where national cohesion is at risk, there must be zoning. It is not like zoning means jettisoning competency, but we can zone and also ensure that only competent people get the tickets.\n\n\u201cFor instance, I see no reason why the Presidency should not go to the South East, it is about equity and justice not a game of numbers. There is no way to promote loyalty to the ideals of Nigeria other than by sharing power with the ethnic groups that feel marginalised. At this point, let\u2019s stop the number game, if the two dominant parties agree, then all is balanced. We must make Nigeria liveable and also workable for her people,\u201d she further said.",

And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others. Our programmes, reforms and initiatives are targeted at improving the quality of life and placing them at the centre of our politics. The vituperations of APC and their minions will never in any way derail this sacred mandate given freely by the majority of Edo people in September last year.\n\nAndrew Emwanta JP\n\nCommissioner for Communication and Orientation, Edo State\n\nDecember 30, 2021\n\n...",

For the Electoral Act, he faulted errors, saying direct primary will be too expensive and will affect security. But he signed something that he knows would affect the economic survival of the country negatively.\u201d\n\nWike berated the federal government over what he described as a lopsided fight against corruption, saying that criminals were only found in Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u201cbut if you go over to the All Progressives Congress (APC), you are no longer a criminal. What kind of system is that? Is that the kind of leadership you want?\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we speak today, there is no judicial autonomy in Nigeria. Go and see the nature of the Federal courts.

In a country, when you see abomination, like an invasion of Supreme Court justice\u2019 house, it is not just an invasion; it is a threat to the judiciary. And the president could not say, \u2018I will not accept this\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers governor observed that the country needed a leadership that has regard for every region, irrespective of their religion. \u201cIf some people are saying that they are not part of you, it is your duty to make them feel that they are part of you. How do we build hope and confidence? It is by the kind of things that I do.\u201d\n\nWike said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must take responsibility FOR rescuing the country. He lamented the worsening insecurity in the country, saying that no part was safe again.\n\n\u201cThe whole aim of a government is to protect lives and property. When that is not there, then there is no governance again. People must be allowed to use the road, health facility, to go to school and farm. These are the kind of things we continue to hear. Is that the kind of Nigeria you bargained for?\u201d\n\nThe governor, who disclosed he was yet to see his parents and relatives in the New Year, said he decided to be in Bauchi on January 1, 2022 to be with his friend because he held him in high esteem.\n\nBala Mohammed thanked him for leaving the comfort of his state to visit him. He described Wike as a man who makes friends with people from other parts of the country",
          "summary": "Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike has argued that the N17.127 trillion budget signed into law last week by President Muhammadu Buhari is not implementable.\nWike noted that the President should have returned the budget to the National Assembly for correction before assent, as according to him, many of the provisions cannot be implemented.\nHe said, \u201cYou saw a president yesterday that said this budget is unimplementable, yet he went ahead and signed something he knows would not help the country.\nHe lamented the worsening insecurity in the country, saying that no part was safe again.\nHe described Wike as a man who makes friends with people from other parts of the country",

          "title": "For the Record: \u2018Wake Up and Help Save Our Tomorrow!\u2019 \u2013 Text of Open Letter By Emeka Obasi Jnr to African Youths on Climate Change",
          "text": "Fellow Youths of our beloved continent, it is with a heart full of trepidation, but also optimism, that I write to you this day. My trepidation stems from the fact that our continent is in danger, threatened menacingly by climate change. Already, Africa is confronted by the twin challenge of insecurity and poverty, but climate change now threatens the continent\u2019s very existence.\n\nBut I am also optimistic about the future of our continent. I look at the numbers; the millions of young Africans doing exploits globally, and particularly at the fact that a vast majority of the population of Africa are young people, and my heart is gladdened. Yes, the challenge of climate change is enormous, but I\u2019m confident that we have what it takes as youths of Africa to galvanize action towards averting the climate crisis that now stare us in the face, which is why I am writing to you today.\n\nLike many of you, I was born at the turn of the 21st Century. Indeed, I was born 21 years ago, at a very auspicious time in the history of mankind. It was a time when an old age had just passed away, giving birth to the new millennium. I was born at exactly 1pm on the first day of the first month of the first year of the new millennium, precisely on January 1st, 2001, at 1pm.\n\nMy mother keeps telling me that I\u2019m a special child; that maybe God wanted me to come on such symbolic day in order to make my life story more engaging.\n\nI spent my early childhood in Lagos, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest city. It\u2019s where I grew up and where I had my early education. I only travelled out during the holidays or during school excursion trips.\n\nLooking back on those years, I find it remarkable that despite maintaining great interest in current affairs, especially given the fact that my father is a Journalist, I never became conscious of the environmental crisis which had begun to endanger Lagos until I came to England for my college education in 2017. It was while here in England that I became increasingly aware of the problems of the environment and the challenges they pose, particularly to African countries.\n\nBut I find it inexcusable, and almost unforgivable that despite living my first decade and a half in Lagos; a city so threatened by climate change that scientists have projected that it may become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise, I did not become conscious of climate change and indeed the environment. What it underlines is the acute lack of deliberate policies to create awareness among the younger generation of Africans.\n\nLagos is a coastal city with a population of 24 million and is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by 2100 as a result of global warming. According to certain scientific projections, Lagos could become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise.\n\nIt is, however, heartwarming that the state is already taking action to ensure that this potential disaster is averted. Not long ago, the the Lagos State government unveiled a five-year Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2020-2025. The goal, as stated by Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, is to achieve an emission-neutral city by 2050.\n\nBut the case of Lagos state is not unique. It typifies the acute environmental problems facing many parts of Nigeria. There is increasing desertification in the North, which has had very huge impact on security in the country; erosion in the East; oil spillage in the South/South, among others. The scenario is similar in other parts of Africa. Global warming is expected to melt Africa\u2019s remaining glaciers in the next few decades, and the reduction in water essential to agricultural production will create food insecurity, poverty, and population displacement.\n\nAgriculture, which remains heavily dependent on rainfall, is critical to Africa\u2019s economic growth, thus, climate change could potentially destabilize local markets, increase food insecurity, limit economic growth, escalate insecurity and increase risk for agriculture sector investors. Without doubt, for Africa to survive, sustained action must be taken beginning from today.\n\nIn this, our generation has a very critical role to play, because as we say in Nigeria, the youths are the leaders of tomorrow. If we analyse that saying well, it makes a lot of sense. Of course, the future belongs to the younger generation \u2013 it is their inheritance \u2013 but as an old African saying has it, the young shall grow.\n\nThe question I ask is, when the young must have grown, then what happens? The expectation is that when the young grow they will inherit the Earth. My worry is in what shape that Earth will be.\n\nSo, it is important that young people become involved in the global effort to ensure that the Earth is in fit and proper condition to make a worthwhile inheritance. Therefore, the effort to improve the environment should be championed by the youths because the world of tomorrow belongs to us.\n\nWhereas it is true that today belongs to our fathers and mothers, tomorrow belongs to the children; to us, and what we do today will surely determine the fate of our tomorrow and the fate of those coming after us. Therefore, I have resolved to contribute my own quota towards the global push to create a more sustainable, safer, cleaner and healthier environment for the future by setting up an NGO, \u201cOur Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe NGO will become an active player in the climate change ecosystem and I am committed to getting the youths of Africa to commit to this noble endeavour.\n\nOur tomorrow has a three point agenda:\n\nTo wake African youths up to the reality of the existential threat climate change poses to their future.\n\nTo sensitize African leaders, both at the government, corporate and non-governmental levels, to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change.\n\nTo mobilize resources, both material and human, to campaign and create sustained awareness of Africans, especially the youths, on the need to be actively involved in the battle to save the environment for their future and for future generations.\n\nFor me, it is a struggle of a lifetime. It is a call which I feel honoured to answer.\n\nAs the great Marxian philosopher, Frantz Fanon, once wrote: Every generation must, out of relative obscurity, discover its true mission and either fulfil or betray it. I am proud to state that as an African youth, I have found my mission and by the grace of God, I will not betray it.\n\nMy target is to mobilise the teeming populace of the youths in Africa to achieve a critical mass of climate change advocates, whose voices will resonate loudly and clearly and catalyse positive action. We will use the awesome power of social media to create this unstoppable army and empower their voices in every country in Africa.\n\nIndeed, the prospects are exciting, I invite all African youths to this adventure.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nPrince Emeka Obasi junior.\n\nAston University, Birmingham, England.",

          "text": "Nurses in Lagos State under the umbrella of Lagos State Council of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) are to embark on three-day warning strike from January 10 over unmet demands by the state government.\n\nNANNM gave the order for its members to embark on the strike action in a circular signed by its state secretary, Oloruntoba Odumosu with REF NO: NANNM/LS/SEC/VOL.II/148/001 and addressed to members of the association in the state.\n\nThe circular said that the SEC of the association resolved to embark on the warning strike at its meeting held on December 29, 2021, accusing the administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of failure to meet its demands.\n\nThis strike notice is coming a few months after the union abruptly aborted its decision to go on an indefinite strike in September 2021, following the last-minute approval of its request for payment of uniform allowance for its members by the government.\n\nWhile the government has failed to meet other demands aside from the payment of the uniform allowance, the union has reiterated some of the existing issues in the new directive.\n\nThe union highlighted eight issues in the circular, including what it described as the acute shortage of nurses and midwives in the state owned health facilities; payment of retention allowance, regularisation of graduate and stagnated nurses, improved welfare and working condition of nurses, improved hazard allowance, and life Insurance scheme for nurses and other health workers, among others.\n\nThe union also noted that the Federal Health Institutions have been exempted from the strike, which it noted would be monitored for strict compliance.\n\n\u201cThe struggle at hand requires the commitment and steadfastness of all members. We urge you all to play your part well,\u201d the union wrote.\n\nBefore the union rescinded its decision to go on strike in September, it gave a 21-day ultimatum to the government, threatening to down tools should it fail to pay the allowances or put in place concrete steps to commence the processes.\n\nThe union accused the government of \u201csectarianism\u201d, saying while those working under the state\u2019s health service commission are unpaid, their counterparts at the primary health care board and the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) have either received their payment or were in the process of receiving it.\n\nIts strike notice, which was addressed to the governor in September, had read in part; \u201cAs of now, the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) and the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board have commenced the payment of the allowance to nurses and midwives.\n\n\u201cPayment at the Ministry of Health would commence soon. The Health Service Commission where a large percentage of nurses and midwives in the state are domiciled is yet to commence payment and has informed us it made no provision for the payment of the allowance\n\n\u201cWe would want to make it unequivocal that a situation where the Health Service Commission Nurses and Midwives would not be paid the uniform allowance for this year cannot be contemplated and would not be tolerated at all.\n\n\u201cWe ask that you take this letter as both a reminder and an ultimatum for possible commencement of industrial action. If we do not have concrete assurances in terms of the approval of the governor and steps for the commencement of the payment within the next 21 days, the council would be left with no other choice than to take industrial action to press home our request.\u201d",

          "title": "2022 Budget Insertions: No Rift Between Buhari, NASS \u2013 Presidency",
          "text": "The Presidency has cleared the air regarding what it described as widely-viewed/reported episode on Friday, December 31, 2021 at the State House in Abuja during the signing of the 2022 Budget and Finance Bill 2022 by President Muhammadu Buhari; specifically on the insertions in the 2022 Appropriation Act, of 6,576 new schemes worth about N37billion by the National Assembly.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Sunday said while it is true that the President expressed disagreement with these and many of the other alterations, including the \u201creduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment Projects\u2019,\u201d innumerable lies were being spread about the President being \u201cangry\u201d at, had \u201cblasted\u201d or \u201clashed out\u201d at the Parliament.\n\nAccording to him, this cannot be farther from the truth.\n\nHe said as the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, said shortly after the budget-signing ceremony, disagreements as the ones listed by the President were normal in the everyday Executive-Parliamentary relationship because, as he explained, \u201cexecutive and legislative judgements don\u2019t always have to be the same.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cWhile we note that there are people who are trying to create a fiasco between the two arms of government on account of the budget, we assure that they will, in the end, be disappointed.\n\n\u201cThe Executive and the 9th National Assembly have since moved away from the wild, destructive political games of the past, conducting themselves in a way that puts national interest supreme in their decisions.\n\n\u201cWe doubt if there is a patriotic citizen who wants to see the return of the operating environment engendered by the 8th Senate when an elected government was held in chains, held hostage to the desperate political ambitions of a clique, and the public denied needed services including that which impinged on national security. Happily, the 9th National Assembly is more about policy than politics.\n\n\u201cUnder the constitution, both arms of government are coequal and at the same time, independent and interdependent. The rule of the game is cooperation and the President, as a democrat fully accepts this.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShehu further stated that Mr. President was clear and candid in expressing his reservations with the numerous changes to the 2022 Budget made by the National Assembly, which would hamper its implementation.\n\nHowever, he said it was necessary to respond to critics that questioned why President assented to the Budget if it was so severely tampered with, citing reasons for the action.\n\n\u201cAlthough over 10,733 projects were reduced and 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly, there are tens of thousands more provisions in the 2022 Budget, all of which, when efficiently and effectively implemented, will have significant developmental impact on the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGiven Mr. President\u2019s commitment to improving the lot of the Common Man, it was felt that it would not be wise to throw away the baby with the bathwater. Ongoing Capital Projects, Critical Recurrent Votes, Priority New Projects \u2013 all feature in the 2022 Budget and Mr. President\u2019s forbearance in assenting to the Budget will save these provisions from implementation delays and other challenges.\n\nThe presidential spokesman further stated that President Buhari is a democrat who deeply believes in the supremacy of the Constitution, with its checks and balances across the three arms of Government.\n\nAccording to him, in terms of the passage of legislations like the Appropriation Act and other Money Bills, the National Assembly has equal responsibilities with the Executive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndeed, he noted if Mr. President had declined assent to the 2022 Appropriation Bill, the National Assembly has powers to override the President\u2019s veto if they can drum up a 2/3 majority vote as stipulated by the constitution.\n\n\u201cHappily, this situation has not arisen during the tenure of Mr. President\u2019s Administration, and the Executive\u2019s relationship with the Leadership of the 9th National Assembly is much improved over what happened with the 8th National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is on account of his confidence in the strength of this excellent working relationship that Mr. President has directed that an Amendment Budget Proposal should be prepared and submitted to the National Assembly, once they return from their recess.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the National Assembly will carefully consider and approve the 2022 Amendment Budget Proposals, once presented to them in due course, for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is important therefore that, in place of \u201canger\u201d or confrontation, President Buhari showed the democracy-loving side of his personality as he signed the budget at the same time calling for dialogue with the parliament to resolve the contentious issues.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency under Muhammadu Buhari and the parliament under Lawal and Gbajabiamila are committed to a good neighborly relationship and this or any other disagreement between the two arms of government will not alter the dynamics of that relationship,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "Buhari makes U-Turn, okays padding of 2022 budget by National Assembly",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is okay with the alterations and padding of the 2022 budget by the National Assembly, the Presidency stated on Sunday night.\n\nIn a statement that tried to offer a new interpretation of Buhari\u2019s misgiving about the budget, which he signed, Aso Rock now claimed that Buhari\u2019s comment was misinterpreted.\n\n\u2018While it is true that the President expressed disagreement with these and many of the other alterations, including the \u201creduction in the provisions for many strategic capital projects to introduce \u2018Empowerment Projects\u2019,\u201d innumerable lies are being spread about the President being \u201cangry\u201d at, had \u201cblasted\u201d or \u201clashed out\u201d at the Parliament.\n\n\u2018This cannot be farther from the truth\u2019, said presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu..\n\nIn the budget, the National Assembly inserted 6,576 new schemes worth about N37 billion and also reduced the allocation to some capital projects, dear to the executive.\n\nBut Shehu said: \u201cAs the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan said shortly after the budget-signing ceremony, disagreements as the ones listed by the President are normal in the everyday Executive-Parliamentary relationship because, as he explained, \u201cexecutive and legislative judgements don\u2019t always have to be the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we note that there are people who are trying to create a fiasco between the two arms of government on account of the budget, we assure that they will, in the end, be disappointed.\n\n\u201cThe Executive and the 9th National Assembly have since moved away from the wild, destructive political games of the past, conducting themselves in a way that puts national interest supreme in their decisions.\n\n\u201d We doubt if there is a patriotic citizen who wants to see the return of the operating environment engendered by the 8th Senate when an elected government was held in chains, held hostage to the desperate political ambitions of a clique, and the public denied needed services including that which impinged on national security. Happily, the 9th National Assembly is more about policy than politics.\n\n\u201cUnder the constitution, both arms of government are coequal and at the same time, independent and interdependent. The rule of the game is cooperation and the President, as a democrat fully accepts this.\n\nShehu also replied critics who wondered why Buhari signed the budget despite his reservations.\n\nHe said the Buhari assented to the appropriation bill to Save Value-Additive Projects Programs & Policies and also to demonstrate that he is a democrat.\n\nHe also revealed plans by the executive to present to the National Assembly 2022 Amendment Budget Proposals.\n\n\u201cAlthough over 10,733 projects were reduced and 6,576 new projects were introduced into the budget by the National Assembly, there are tens of thousands more provisions in the 2022 Budget, all of which, when efficiently and effectively implemented, will have significant developmental impact on the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cGiven Mr. President\u2019s commitment to improving the lot of the Common Man, it was felt that it would not be wise to throw away the baby with the bathwater. Ongoing Capital Projects, Critical Recurrent Votes, Priority New Projects \u2013 all feature in the 2022 Budget and Mr. President\u2019s forbearance in assenting to the Budget will save these provisions from implementation delays and other challenges.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is a democrat who deeply believes in the supremacy of the Constitution, with its checks and balances across the three arms of Government. In terms of the passage of legislations like the Appropriation Act and other Money Bills, the National Assembly has equal responsibilities with the Executive.\n\n\u201cIndeed, if Mr. President had declined assent to the 2022 Appropriation Bill, the National Assembly has powers to override the President\u2019s veto if they can drum up a 2/3 majority vote. This is the constitution.\n\n\u201cHappily, this situation has not arisen during the tenure of Mr. President\u2019s Administration, and the Executive\u2019s relationship with the Leadership of the 9th National Assembly is much improved over what happened with the 8th National Assembly. It is on account of his confidence in the strength of this excellent working relationship that Mr. President has directed that an Amendment Budget Proposal should be prepared and submitted to the National Assembly, once they return from their recess.\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that the National Assembly will carefully consider and approve the 2022 Amendment Budget Proposals, once presented to them in due course, for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is important therefore that, in place of \u201canger\u201d or confrontation, President Buhari showed the democracy-loving side of his personality as he signed the budget at the same time calling for dialogue with the parliament to resolve the contentious issues.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency under Muhammadu Buhari and the parliament under Lawan and Gbajabiamila are committed to a good neighborly relationship and this or any other disagreement between the two arms of government will not alter the dynamics of that relationship\u201d.",

          "title": "Igboho: Ilana Omo Oodua attacks lawyer Olajengbesi over resignation",
          "text": "The war of words between Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups has alleged that its Abuja based lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, traded Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, currently being detained in Republic of Benin and its struggle for financial and political gains.\n\nThe group said this while reacting to the resignation of the lawyer from the legal team of Igboho earlier on Sunday.\n\nOlajengbesi, who helped get 12 associates of Igboho arrested by Department of State Services, DSS during a raid on the Ibadan Oyo State home of the secessionist last July had in a statement on Sunday announced his resignation from the legal team.\n\nOlajengbesi had in the statement washed his hands off any matter relating to Igboho and the Yoruba Nation Agitators except the cases currently in court related to two of the associates of the agitator.\n\nThe lawyer resigned after he was attacked by Ilana Oodua following his criticisms of a statement by the group\u2019s leader, Banji Akitoye that Osun and Ekiti governorship elections scheduled for later this year may not hold if Igboho was not released from prison.\n\nThe group had also condemned a statement issued by Olajengbesi in which he appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene to release Igboho from prison.\n\nBut Ilana Omo Oodua said it was wrong for Olajengbesi to announce his resignation through social media since he wasn\u2019t hired through the Social media in a statement signed by the Communication Manager to the group Chairman, Maxwell Adeleye.\n\nIt also noted that Olajengbesi\u2019s resignation is a contradiction and full of paradox. The group accused the lawyer of falsely claiming to be lawyer to Igboho to hobnob with Nigerian government for financial gains.\n\n\u201cLastly, it should be on record that contrary to the claim of Olajengbesi, he is not a personal lawyer to Sunday Igboho, but a Lawyer to the Yoruba Self-determination struggle.\n\n\u201cHe was introduced to us by Chief Yomi Aliyu, SAN. The Self-Determination Struggle hired, retained and paid for the services of Pelumi Olajengbesi, not Chief Sunday Igboho. Olajengbesi, perhaps, looking for fame and popularity, used the media to brand himself as Ighoho\u2019s Lawyer. We chose to allow him to enjoy the fame to avoid distraction.\n\n\u201cNow having appropriated some fame, he turns to hobnobbing with the Nigerian Government to trade Chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho and our self-determination struggle for financial and political gains,\u201d the group said.\n\nIt also said it will no longer allow the lawyer to represent two members of the group being tried for terrorism.\n\nRead the full statement below\n\nIlana Omo Oodua (IOO), the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups has said it was wrong for its counsel, Mr Pelumi Olajengbesi to annouce his resignation through social media since he wasn\u2019t hired through the Social media.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Communication Manager to the group Chairman, Maxwell Adeleye and made available to Vanguard in Ibadan on Sunday, the group noted that Olajengbesi\u2019s resignation is a contradiction and full of paradox.\n\nThe statement reads \u201cthe Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) Worldwide, the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups all over the world has received the media report of the resignation of Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi, the Lawyer that the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Groups worldwide retained and paid to defend the aides of Chief Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho) against the Department of State Services (DSS) at an Abuja High Court.\n\n\u201cWe want to state very expressly that we did not hire Mr. Olajengbesi through the social media and it is not ideal for him to have resigned through the social media. Choosing the social media to resign is an indication of his lack of understanding of the ethics of his profession. It clearly raises questions on his integrity and honour.\n\n\u201cWe want the whole world to know that Mr. Olajengbesi resigned over the response of the Yoruba people worldwide to his provocative and unnecessary attack on social media against our revered leader, Professor Banji Akintoye on 31st December, 2021. The attack was over the statement of the renowned scholar declaring that there will be no Governorship Election in Ekiti and Osun States in 2022.\n\n\u201cOlajengbesi, in a conversation with IOO Directors of Legal Affairs and Communications, Barrister Olasupo Ojo and Mr. Maxwell Adeleye respectively, expressed regret of his action against Professor Banji Akintoye, stating that he had realised that he dabbled into an issue that does not concern him.\n\n\u201cHe agreed to make clarifications and apologise for misleading the public and misrepresenting the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Struggle. Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi admitted to us that he reacted too quickly to Prof. Banji Akintoye\u2019s statement, and that he was wrong, erred and thereby verbally apologized. This we accepted and called everyone concerned within the Homeland and Diaspora to stop releasing further statements against him forthwith.\n\n\u201cMr. Olajengbesi admitted that he was misled by The Punch Newspaper\u2019s \u201cambiguous\u201d report. He admitted that he hadn\u2019t read the full statement of Professor Banji Akintoye before he reacted through his Facebook timeline.\n\n\u201cWe therefore want to state that Mr. Olajengbesi\u2019s so-called social media resignation is full of contradictions and a paradox. He said he was quitting every case that has to do with Sunday Igboho and the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Struggle, at the same time he said he will continue with the case of the Ighoho2 charged for terrorism by the DSS.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t approbate and re-approbate. You can\u2019t be out attacking us on the social media and still want to handle the Ighoho2 case. You can\u2019t eat your cake and have it. The public embarrassment, humiliation and opprobrium that has been brought to the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Struggle by Olajengbesi in the last 24 hours is enough. With the way he has conducted himself in the last 24 hours, we are of the opinion that if allowed to continue with the Ighoho2 case, Pelumi Olajengbesi will sabotage us and trade the two innocent people to the Nigerian Government. We do not want him anywhere near our struggle anymore. He has clearly indicated that he lacks honour, integrity and decency.\n\n\u201cOlajengbesi fallaciosuly wrote a happy new year message on behalf of Sunday Adeyemo Igboho to President Muhammad Buhari without authorisation, impersonating and painting the image of a tired & surrendered Ighoho. When the statement of Professor Banji Akintoye on Ekiti and Osun State Elections overshadowed his Abuja-teleguided and self-serving statement, he got angry and went to the social media to attack Professor Banji Akintoye. He later confirmed to us on the phone that it was the DSS who sent him the Punch report of Professor Banji Akintoye\u2019s statement which prompted his social media virulence against our struggle.\n\n\u201cWhile Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi has a right to do whatever he likes in his personal capacity, we are however surprised that he could be wildly unethical in his professional approach by choosing to use social media to attack Professor Banji Akintoye\u2019s New Year Statement on behalf of the Yoruba Nation Self-Determination Movement. We at Ilana Omo Oodua, being the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-Determination Groups, consider Olajengbesi\u2019s action as a betrayal of trust that we reposed in him and an abuse of the ethics of his legal profession. He took advantage of his association with our movement to perpetrate his personal agenda to our own detriment which is against the run of play.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge Mr. Pelumi Olajengbesi\u2019s fundamental human rights, the right as a Politician from Osun State and his strong interest in this year\u2019s Governorship Election in his home state for the 2023 general elections, a fraudulent process which Ilana Omo Oodua seeks the Instrumentalities of the law to stop, hence, his decision to attack Professor Banji Akintoye, not because he truly loves Chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho. CSI had before his arrest, made it clear to the world that it is #NoReferendumNoElection.\n\n\u201cLastly, it should be on record that contrary to the claim of Olajengbesi, he is not a personal lawyer to Sunday Igboho, but a Lawyer to the Yoruba Self-determination struggle. He was introduced to us by Chief Yomi Aliyu, SAN. The Self-Determination Struggle hired, retained and paid for the services of Pelumi Olajengbesi, not Chief Sunday Igboho. Olajengbesi, perhaps, looking for fame and popularity, used the media to brand himself as Ighoho\u2019s Lawyer. We chose to allow him to enjoy the fame to avoid distraction. Now having appropriated some fame, he turns to hobnobbing with the Nigerian Government to trade Chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho and our self-determination struggle for financial and political gains\u201d.",

          "title": "My persecutors planned to drug, undress, film me among prostitutes \u2013 Mbaka",
          "text": "Fiery Catholic priest and founder of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka has said that his sudden disappearance sometime in 2021 was meant to hack him to death by those he said were persecuting him.\n\nAccording to The Nation, the cleric said that the plan was to take and drug him, undress him before prostitutes and film him where he would be seen frolicking with prostitutes before hacking him to death.\n\nMbaka also said that he never asked anyone to vote for Muhammadu Buhari as the president of Nigeria during his 2015 prophecy.\n\nMbaka was invited to the Bishop\u2019s Court after asking President Muhammadu Buhari to resign or be impeached in May last year with the presidency firing back and alleging that the cleric was angry because he sought to secure contracts from the Buhari-led government and was denied\n\nDuring his invitation to the Bishop\u2019s Court, his phones went off and nothing was heard from him after several hours, a development that forced his followers to besiege the Bishop\u2019s Court and demand his immediate release.\n\nExplaining what happened in that incident in his 2022 New Year message during the cross over night at the Adoration Ground, Emene, Enugu, Mbaka said the people who caused his disappearance wanted to give him the Nnamdi Kanu treatment.\n\nHe told the congregation, \u201cThe day you went on rampage looking for me, they would have killed me that night.\n\n\u201cThe way they took Nnamdi Kanu was what they planned to do to me. They would have picked me up and drugged me and I would be acting under the influence of that drug.\n\n\u201cBut the Holy Spirit already gave me an order on Sunday night. It is that kind of order that is called \u2018supernatural mandamus\u2019. The Holy Spirit told me never to park in a place for 20 minutes. You know I was given an order not to come into this adoration ground for 30 days.\n\n\u201cI was invited for a meeting and on my arrival, I noticed that it was a panel that was sitting about me. It was on that panel that I was ordered not to conduct adoration again for 30 days. They also said that I shouldn\u2019t come into my house for 30 days. I told them that I didn\u2019t have any toiletries, took brush and even money to buy them and that I would need to get home to pick some things before going but they refused and yet, I obeyed.\n\n\u201cBut the Holy Spirit told me to be careful with my obedience and never to park anyhow. I never knew that the Holy Spirit already knew that I was under watch. I parked my car in front of St. Joseph and I went to pray for like 15 to 20 minutes. I never knew they were tracking me that night.\n\n\u201cBefore the next morning when you people started looking for me, their plan was immediately they picked me up, they would take me to Cubana Junction where they would parade me among prostitutes. They would also show a video where I was frolicking with the prostitutes. The question would have been: what was Mbaka doing in this kind of place?\n\n\u201cFrom Cubana, they would have taken me to the one in front of Igboeze where prostitutes also stay. This was where they had planned to undress me. The question would have been, what was he doing there naked.\u201d\n\nThe priest disclosed that the grand plan was to take him to Abuja and kill me along the road.\n\nHe however withdrew the apologies he gave to Enugu Catholic Bishop, Callistus Onaga, after his disappearance last year, saying the reverse should be the case.\n\nHis words: \u201cI was apologizing after everything that happened. But two days ago, I was asking myself, why should I apologise to anyone? I shouldn\u2019t have apologised at all. They should be the ones to apologise to me because they wronged me.\n\n\u201cThey should be very careful, otherwise they will get the treatment my uncle got for always beating my father before us and his children when I was still a little boy.\n\n\u201cThis uncle kept beating my father till he lost one of his teeth as a result of the constant beatings. And on each occasion, my father would keep crying and I would do nothing because I was still a young boy.\n\n\u201cWhen I entered secondary school, I joined Taekwondo training to enable me to gather enough skills and tactics to fight back for my father. I was still leading Block Rosary and Charismatic very well.\n\n\u201cIt was after I was ordained a deacon that my uncle beat a tooth out of my father\u2019s mouth. In my uncle\u2019s mind, I would still do nothing about that because I was already a deacon. But I returned home to teach my uncle a great lesson he never forgot in his lifetime. I used him to show off my taekwondo skills and he found himself crying and begging for forgiveness.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m begging those who have set out to persecute Mbaka to leave me alone. I\u2019m over obedient (to the authorities of the church). If you ask me to kneel down, I will lie down. But, will my children (members of adoration) watch me lying down? That is the problem. Look at the crowd here (over hundred thousand worshippers). It is no longer Mbaka that is being persecuted. Nothing is too much to fight for a father.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleading that 2022 should be a year of peace. Fr. Mbaka has continued to embrace peace to the extent of mounting the kind of a giant billboard in front of the ministry. The Pope\u2019s picture and all the bishops are there. Someone who is doing all this, do you still think he is quarreling with anyone?\n\n\u201cAnyone persecuting me and this Adoration Ministry is persecuting the Holy Spirit. He should be ready to bear any consequences that follow.\n\n\u201cFrom the one room I was given at Umuchigbo, God has given us a place (Adoration Ministry) he wants us to stay. This ground was an evil forest. I know what I did to remove the various deities in this forest before making it inhabitable.\n\n\u201cPeople should stop attacking this Ministry. It is where Igbos are getting their liberation. It is where souls are liberated.\u201d\n\nWith the over hundred thousand participants in the adoration ground on Friday night, Mbaka said even the Pope would be proud of the Ministry and do everything possible to protect it.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t the church appreciate what she has? What kind of fight is this? The worst is that some priests are joining in this rubbish. Priests should not create \u2018anti-clericalism\u2019 because the lay people will soon begin to insult and attack them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cleric who intensified prayers for the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in 2022, saying he sees the IPOB leader as his son.\n\nHe however pleaded with fellow priests to stop castigating him for praying for and blessing Kanu over his travail.\n\nMbaka said: \u201cI\u2019m begging my fellow priests to stop condemning me for praying for Nnamdi Kanu. I am not closing any priest\u2019s mouth and nobody should close my own. If I use my mouth to bless Nnamdi Kanu and you don\u2019t like it, please use your own mouth to curse him. Leave me to bless him.\n\n\u201cI see Nnamdi Kanu as my son. Every Igbo man and woman is my child. You may not understand the spiritual authority I have on this land.\n\n\u201cIf as a church, we can be praying for Nigeria in distress, nobody can stop us from praying for Nnamdi Kanu and our brothers in distress.\n\n\u201cThis year will be for Kanu and those held for agitations. God will show them mercy this year.\u201d\n\nHe thanked his followers for treating him as their shepherd, saying, \u201cI thank you all for listening to me as you rampaged and were about to destroy things. But immediately I called on you to be calm, you calmed down and avoided destruction of things. I\u2019m happy for your obedience.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything wrong. They\u2019re just trying to touch the tail of the lion. They should know that such an action has serious consequences.\n\n\u201cThey should look for those who are disturbing them. We\u2019re not disturbing anyone. In fact, we have never come to this ground to say anything bad about our bishop. We have never said any bad prayer against the bishop. Every time we remember him, it is blessings all through that we declare for him.\n\n\u201cSo, someone I call father should treat me equally as a son. You can\u2019t push somebody to the level of rebellion. It will look ridiculous for you to experience what happened to my uncle who beat out one of my father\u2019s teeth, I used him to show off my taekwondo and judo skills. And people couldn\u2019t believe that a man on his way to becoming a priest could act like that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of priest the society needs. When the masses are being maltreated, he speaks. If you are a governor, you already know that you must do well.\u201d\n\nHe used the opportunity to correct the impression people had about his 2015 prophecy on Buhari\u2019s presidency.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen I said that Buhari would be president, I didn\u2019t tell anyone to vote for Buhari. But people were just quoting me out of context. I told you that it was revealed to me that Buhari would be president. That it was revealed to me doesn\u2019t mean that you should vote for him. What it meant was that whether you voted or not, Buhari would emerge as president. It\u2019s a vision. I also said that if he began to mess up that I would attack him. He started messing up and I started attacking him. And people were saying that I was insulting the president.\u201d",

          "title": "Tackling insecurity in 2022: With N12trn budget in 7 yrs, Nigerians set agenda for troops, others",
          "text": "Not less than N12trillion was budgeted for security in the last seven years (2016-2022), Blueprint can authoritatively reveal.\n\nThe revelation is coming amidst rising insecurity with Nigerians calling on the troops, police and other security agencies to step up in the fight against insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, farmers/ herders\u2019 clashes and related crimes.\n\nBreakdown\n\nBlueprint gathered that in 2016, N1.04 trillion was budgeted out of which N443.1billion was allocated to Ministry of Defence; in 2017, N1.053 trillion was appropriated for security-related outfits out of which Ministry of Defence got N330.54 billion.\n\nA further breakdown showed that in 2018, over N1.305 trillion was appropriated for security-related sector aside $1billion withdrawn from excess crude oil account, out of which $496 million was used for procurement of 12 Tucano fighter jets from the United States of America.\n\nIn the 2019 fiscal year, budgetary allocations to security-related agencies jumped to N1.76 trillion from which the Ministry of Interior got N617.9 billion, Defence \u2013 N589.9 billion, Police-N366 billion, Operation Lafiya Dole \u2013 N75 billion, and Office of the National Security Adviser got N120 billion.\n\nAlso in 2020, the security vote was increased to N1.78 trillion, while it was moved up to N1.97 trillion in 2021 aside the N802 billion added from the N983 billion supplementary budget, which was later approved for President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBesides, in the 2021 fiscal year, a total of N85 billion was approved for Police Trust Fund \u2013 N11billion in March and N74 billion in June.\n\nAnd in the N17.13 trillion Budget for the 2022 current fiscal year, a total of N2.41 trillion, representing 15% of the entire budgetary projections, was earmarked for security and defence.\n\nThe figure represents an increase of about N1.37 trillion from N1.04 trillion it was in 2016.\n\nIn all, from 2016 to the already projected 2022, about N12 trillion has been sunk into security/defence as budgetary vote arising from prevailing security challenges in the country.\n\nThere are mixed reactions over the military budget.\n\nWhile some told Blueprint that the sum is not only justified but also well spent, others differ, saying there is no justification for it and therefore called for accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s justifiable \u2013 Military source\n\nEfforts by Blueprint to get Army Headquarters\u2019 comment failed as text message sent to the spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachuckwu was not responded to.\n\nHowever, a military source who volunteered to speak under anonymitysaid \u201cno amount is too much for a military that is at war on many fronts.\u201d\n\nThe top military chief said the fact the troops are deployed to over 33 states further justifies the huge budgetary allocation to the military over the years.\n\n\u201cThe money is justified because Nigeria is at war and the military must prosecute the war with superior firepower in order to emerge victorious. The myriads of security challenges across the country ranging from insurgency in the North-east, banditry in the North-west, kidnapping and all manner of insecurity across the country has made extra funding for the military necessary.\n\n\u201cNo amount is too much for a military that is at war, hence the need to uplift the resources available to our armed forces to enable them procure the best tools to help win this war. Don\u2019t forget that the military is helping the police in 33 states across Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory to combat internal security challenges,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn whether the monies appropriated over the years were well spent, the source said: \u201cThe money appropriated has been well spent and for the things we are doing, a lot has to do with funding to solve a lot of problems that our troops are facing in the North-east, North-west and North-central.\n\n\u201cOur country is going through very challenging times and the armed force is at the forefront of resolving the challenges that we are facing. And for any armed forces to function effectively they need equipment, they need capabilities.\u201d\n\nFG lauds troops\n\nAlso speaking on the feats achieved by the military at a recent media parley in Lagos, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the Nigerian military should be applauded.\n\nHe said: \u201cDespite the enormity of the challenge, our military has continued to live up to their billing. We owe them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and sacrifice. We just can\u2019t appreciate them enough, as you will soon see when I break down their achievements in the year under review.\u201d\n\nThe minister who reeled out the various operational teams set up by the military hierarchy and the achievements recorded across the country, said various platforms were procured for the armed forces to ensure efficient operations across the country.\n\n\n\nMohammed, who spoke mainly on the activities in 2021 said: \u201cThe procurement of modern platforms for the armed forces has also gone a long way in raising the level of their operational readiness and efficiency, in addition to boosting their capabilities. During the period under review, the Nigerian Army procured 160 MRAPS, 150 trucks and 60 APCs to improve its equipment holding. Various kits were equally provided for troops. This is in addition to the provision of accommodation for troops and the recruitment of over 10,000 personnel into the Army.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Navy (NN), for its part, commissioned the FALCON EYE Maritime Domain Awareness Capability, the third locally-built Seaward Defense Boat, one helicopter, 4 inshore patrol boats and 90 Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats. Over 1,500 personnel were recruited into the Navy during the year.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of 12 Super Tucanos and 3 JF-17 Thunder Fighter Aircraft and other platforms with which it has conducted several Air interdictions, provided close air support to ground troops and destroyed several illegal structures and equipment belonging to terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements.\u201d\n\nPolice equipment\n\nThe minister also spoke on the federal government\u2019s spending on the police.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe implementation of the community policing initiative of the current administration has led to the training of 25,000 constabularies in several police colleges across the country. The successful officers who were trained on basic police duties, modern intelligence gathering techniques, rule of law, etc. were deployed to their local governments of origin to aid in intelligence gathering and improve police visibility in their communities.\n\n\u201cAlso, in an effort to improve the police/citizens ratio, 418 Cadet officers of regular course 3 were successfully graduated in June 2021 and deployed into the operational asset of the Nigeria Police Force. Through the Police Trust Fund, 200 Buffalo branded vehicles, bulletproof vest, protective helmets, drugs, and medical equipment as well as arms and ammunition, riot control equipment, and combat equipment were procured for the Police Special Weapon and Tactical Squad (SWAT). The Ministry of Police Affairs has also entered into a contract agreement for the supply of police Anti Riot Equipment with Poly Technology of China through a Government-to-Government arrangement at a cost of 44 million U.S. Dollars. These equipment will go a long way in boosting the capacity of the police to control civil unrest in the most efficient and civil manner.\u201d\n\nAPC chieftain\n\nSimilarly, Director General Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Moh Lukman, said unlike the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\u2019s administration, the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government of President Muhammadu Buhari, has invested heavily in weaponry and equipment.\n\nLukman said: \u201cHundreds of new platforms are being acquired for the Army, Air Force and Navy. The Nigeria Air Force has received 23 new aircraft since 2015, including the newly acquired A-29 Tucano jets. The Navy has similarly acquired its first new Landing Ship Tank (LST) since 1979.\n\n\u201cThe administration has also launched a Nigeria Police Trust Fund. Sadly, public discussion in the country is taking place as if nothing is being done. Opposition politicians and critics of government have even argued that these are wrong investments. Some have argued that rather than invest in acquiring arms, including the A-29 Tucano jets, government should have recruited more military personnel.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Nigeria needs more military personnel, just like the country needs more police personnel. Some security experts have suggested that to end the war against Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, there is the need to deploy not less than 200,000 ground troops. Now, there is less than 50,000 ground troops in the whole of the North-East, which is partly responsible for the inability to hold on to liberated territories after defeating Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, government has succeeded in strengthening the capacity of Nigerian security personnel across all services to be able to respond to national security challenges in all parts of the country. The fact that Nigeria is still faced with the current security challenge arising from activities of terrorists and insurgents requires deeper introspection from citizens.\u201d\n\nExperts\n\nFaulting the positions, however, a security analyst, Dr Charles Nwankpa, said rather than abating, the security challenges were on the rise despite the huge investment.\n\nNwankpa agreed that huge budgetary allocation was needed in the defence and security sector to address the current security challenges facing the country.\n\nHe, however, said insurgency, banditry, kidnappings and other crimes violent crimes were on the increase in spite of huge resources allocated to the sector, just as he accused the military authorities of misappropriation of funds.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the spate of insecurity in the polity has continued to worsen in spite of huge budgetary allocations to the sector over the years. There is no doubt that funds are required to provide adequate weapons, replace old equipment, take care of welfare of personnel in frontline, as well as gather actionable intelligence. But successive military authorities have not been able to account for the huge resources allocated to the sector. There is need to give account.\n\n\u201cDespite huge expenditures on military operations over the years, security remains deteriorating as a result of bad governance, corruption in the military and lack of transparent procurement process. As I speak with you, some of them are currently being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and other anti-graft agencies. We have heard report of nonpayment or diversion of allowances of troops in the frontline in the past.\n\n\u201cThe deteriorating security situation of country also begs for answer. Nowhere is safe. We have been fighting insurgency in the north east for more than 10 years now; bandits have taken over the North-west with some of them collecting taxes and levies from locals. There are also rampant incidents of kidnapping, highway robberies and other violent crimes.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, no part of the country is exempted from the raging insecurity. Nigerians cannot sleep with their two eyes closed. Nigerians have become fugitives in their country owing to escalating insecurity. There are Internally Displaced Person\u2019s Camp (IDPs) camps everywhere.\u201d\n\nSharing similar perspectives, another Abuja-based security expert, Olatunbosun Abolarinwa, faulted what he described has huge budgetary allocations for security and defence in the last seven years.\n\nIn his view, \u201cthe amount expended so far is huge but the results and gains do not justify nor reflect the expenditures.\u201d\n\nOn what should be done differently, the security expert said: \u201cGovernment and Security Agencies should start shifting away from \u2018kinetic approaches\u2019 and start engaging insecurity from strategic approaches.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should caution and sanction politicians who appears to be inciting violence in their speeches and probe how security vote is being spent in all arms of government.\u201d\n\nEx-OATUU scribe, CSOs\n\nSpeaking in similar vein, a former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), Owei Lakemfa said security is not about mere budgeting and funds but about intelligence, strategy, tactics and the involvement of the populace.\n\nHe said there is a \u201cleaky attitude to budgeting, therefore, accountability is not a strong point.\u201d Lakemfa, who recalled $1billion was released to the immediate past service chiefs for arms purchase, said the arms could not be accounted for.\n\n\u201cEffective security is about social justice and the mobilisation of the populace to meet security threats. The Armed Forces should also not be presented as the preserve of groups and sections of the country. Security is every citizen\u2019s problem and should be tackled collectively,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Convener Take Back Nigeria Movement and Co-Convener Say No Campaign Jaye Gaskia described the sum of N12 trillion as huge.\n\n\u201cThe quantum of the amount in terms of its quality is much more important. How much of this sum was spent on the technical and equipment part of the expense? What percentage was expended on salaries, personnel cost and overheads?\n\n\u201cSo, the key question really is how much of this sum was spent on reequipping, on maintenance, on acquiring new platforms, and on enabling new strategic approaches to operations?\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the question of whether there\u2019s a security threat assessment undertaken, and whether on the basis of this assessment report, a comprehensive and integrated security response plan had been developed?\n\n\u201cBecause, without a security threat assessment process and a security response plan development and implementation process in place, whatever the amount of money spent, it is not likely going to be enough to address the problem. It will simply be like fetching water in a basket \u2013 it is a wasteful approach, and solves no problem.\n\n\u201cSo, what should be done differently? There\u2019s a need for an inter agency security threat assessment process, and security response plan development process to be put in place and implementation.\n\n\u201cTake the NE(North-East) for instance, when the military is concentrating its forces in super bases to enhance and amplify their capacity to tackle armed terrorist groups-which they are doing effectively; civil authority-led by the police should also be concentrating on securing communities within the security conference provided by the super camp.\n\n\u201cImplicit in this is the need to coordinate between defence, police, internal security and other law enforcement agencies to enable a seamless security architecture and security response.\n\n\u201cThe other, but also primary component is creating platforms to enable citizen ownership and role in ensuring their own security in their immediate locale.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Executive Director Societal Safety Network (SSN) Abdulrahman Agboola charged President Buhari to hold service chiefs accountable and sack any appointee that failed to perform as expected.\n\nAgbooola, who spoke to one of our correspondents on the telephone said: \u201cConsidering the complications we have in the country today, the government is battling with different forms of security challenges. When you look at the expenses on security since 2016 till today, and you look at the resultant effect on the war against insecurity in Nigeria, a lot of people will agree that the humongous amount of money expended cannot in any way be explained by the people that have handled those finances. There is no justification for such an amount based on the result we are seeing.\n\n\u201cI am not saying the government is not doing its best to tame insecurity, but with the amount of money being mentioned, one will begin to wonder why insecurity persists.\n\n\u201cThere is a particular problem in this administration, and the problem is that the president is not holding the people in charge of security responsibilities to account on the way and manner security issues are being managed. Going forward, there is a need for the president to take charge and take responsibility personally.\n\n\u201cOn what they need to do differently, the security agencies need to improve on their reward and punishment system. Security personnel that are doing well in tackling security challenges should be rewarded and celebrated, to encourage others and them to do more, while those found wanting should be punished or sacked if need be, to serve as a deterrent. If this is encouraged, Nigeria will get the result.\u201d\n\nPDP faults FG\n\nBut contrary to the federal government\u2019s position, the opposition PDP said there is nothing on ground to justify the N12 trillion budget for security/defence investment.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba in an exclusive interview with Blueprint said \u201cprogressively, we have been going in the negative direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is more important to Nigerians is security? About N12 trillion has been budgeted for security/defence to tackle the myriads of security challenges in the last 5 years under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government and we are where we are. What it simply means is that progressively, we have been going in the negative direction.\n\n\u201cIf you compare what happened under the PDP and what has happened under this government on security alone, the statistics show that this is an incompetent government, either complicity or unwilling to tackle the security challenges. Then you know why the result does not match input in terms of budgetary allocation. This is a reflection of APC,\u201d Ologunagba said.\n\nOn what should be done differently to improve the security situation, the PDP spokesman said: \u201cPerception is very important in everything you do. So the federal government must show in everything they do that indeed they want to tackle the security challenges. So what they need to do is that the President by his actions and body language should give directives to the service chiefs to clear the security challenges. And I guarantee you that it will be done because the Nigeria military is capable, they are smart, they are intelligent people and they are professionals, but they need command to get the job done.\u201d\n\nAlso in another reaction, an Abuja resident, Jone Emmanuel lamented that \u201cthere is nothing to show of all the money the government spent on security and defence since 2016. It is highly unfortunate that despite the huge budget Nigerians are still not safe in most parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThere is need for the Federal Government and even the security agencies to set a panel to probe where all the money went into.\n\n\u201cTalking about ways to ease Nigeria out of insecurity in 2022, I want to suggest an inter \u2013 agency collaboration. It appears most that collaboration is not there between security agencies. There is need for collaboration in 2022, this will help in terms of intelligence gathering and tackling the menace.\u201d\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has revealed the agency\u2019s plans to end the scarcity of passport in the country by March, 2022.\n\nActing Comptroller-General of NIS Isa Idris, stated this at the weekend while briefing journalists on the ongoing reforms at the agency.\n\nHe said COVID-19, lack of forex and economic meltdown were responsible for the experienced shortfall of the international passport production.\n\nAccording to him, efforts were being made towards addressing the problem with the launch of an enhanced e-passport, embedded with more and improved features.\n\nHe said apart from the United Kingdom where it was launched, the Service through the support of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has inaugurated such centres in Kano, Port Harcourt and Ibadan.\n\nHe said: \u201cJust Friday, we received a total of 45,000 booklets towards clearing the backlogs and in December alone, we received more than 100,000 booklets which we have continued to distribute across the passport centres nationwide. This is not just for Nigerians in Nigeria alone but for those in the Diaspora as well.\n\nBut with the introduction of the enhanced e-Passport, we are good to go in our efforts towards addressing the scarcity. This enhanced e-passport is a great improvement on the biometric passport technology which we adopted as a country in 2007. It is a strategic step towards curbing forgery, impersonation and other forms of fraud associated with obtaining travel documents under the old Machine Readable Passport regime.\u201d\n\nHe tasked Nigerians to support the agency and avail themselves with the use of technology as a means of ending sharp practices in the Service.\n\n\u201cAnd because we know that technology helps to address some of our challenges, including corruption, we have continued to try to stop personal contacts with our officials. My predecessor started to break the jinx and we are continuing on that. We plead with applicants to apply only online and stop physical contacts with our officers to avert corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nHe further charged them to stop engaging in last-minute application rush saying that, application for renewal can be done six months to the expiration of passports.\n\nHe said there is nowhere in the world where passports are produced in 24 hours except in emergency situations.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

Our efforts have yielded arrests and interdictions. That should be a clear signal to anyone in the drug trade that the rules of the game have changed.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, our goals remain the same: to dismantle drug cartels and syndicates, and that include arresting and having drug offenders jailed by the court and ultimately to rid our society of all traces of illicit substances.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Air Force Kill Two Notorious Bandit Leaders, Several Others In Zamfara\n\nWhile leaving open a window of repentance for those in the trade, Marwa said; \u201cthere is still a window of opportunity for drug traffickers and barons: Now is the time for them to turn over a new leaf before NDLEA turn on the heat and they lose it all. Since most of them are in the business to amass wealth and now they have made fortunes from this trade that harms society, therefore, it is time to quit.\n\n\u201cWe call on them to think about the common good, to think about the future of this country, to think about the young and coming generations. Let commonsense prevail and on your own volition make a significant contribution towards the effort to have a drug-free society where peace and harmony reign.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the havoc of illicit drugs from the ugly development in parts of our nation due to drug abuse by youths and also from the general blight caused by abuse of Cannabis across the country.\n\n\u201cThose who heed this warning will thank themselves for taking the wise decision to quit the drug trade in the days ahead. Those who think and act otherwise can be assured of a tough year in 2022.\n\n\u201cThey can take a cue from what happened in 2021, where the Agency secured various jail terms for over 1, 200 drug traffickers, including nationals of other countries and we brought to book six drug barons, including those outside the country and those who had been on the run for as long as 10 years.\u201d\n\nEmphasising Nigeria\u2019s determination to win the drug war, Gen. Marwa said with the full support of President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly, the Judiciary and the citizenry, NDLEA will leave no stone unturned to fulfill its mandate in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn this campaign against drug abuse and trafficking of illicit substances, the Agency has the public support 100%.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency is backing NDLEA to the hilt. Lawmakers are giving the Agency the necessary leverage. And in the court of law, as proven by recent developments, there is no respite for drug traffickers and barons. Likewise, we have a good rapport with international partners.\n\n\u201cHence, those who deal in illicit substances can be certain that NDLEA\u2019s long arms will reach them and they will face severe penalties from the law,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Israel\u2019s military said early Sunday it launched strikes against militant targets in the Gaza Strip, a day after rockets were fired from the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nVideo filmed in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, showed three huge explosions and fighter jets could be heard flying overhead. There was no immediate confirmation on possible casualties.\n\nThe Israeli military said the attacks targeted a rocket manufacturing facility and a military post for Hamas. It also blamed the militant Islamic group for any violence emanating from the territory it controls.\n\nThe airstrikes come as retaliation for two rockets fired from Gaza on Saturday which landed in the Mediterranean Sea off central Israel.\n\nIt was not clear whether the rockets were meant to hit Israel, but Gaza-based militant groups often test-fire missiles toward the sea. There were no reports of casualties from Saturday\u2019s rocket launches.\n\nApart from a single incident in September, there has been no cross-border rocket fire since a cease-fire ended an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas in May.\n\nThe cease-fire, brokered by Egypt and other mediators, has been fragile. The militant Hamas group says Israel did not take serious steps to ease the blockade it imposed on Gaza with Egypt\u2019s help when the Islamic movement seized control of the coastal enclave in 2007.\n\nTension are also high as other groups like the smaller but more hardline Islamic Jihad threaten military escalation if Israel doesn\u2019t end the administrative detention of a Palestinian prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for over 130 days.\n\nOn Wednesday, Palestinian militants in Gaza shot and lightly wounded an Israeli civilian near the security fence and Israel responded with tank fire targeting multiple Hamas sites in the first exchange of fire in months.",
