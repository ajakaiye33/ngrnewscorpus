          "title": "Ex-TUC president urges FG to borrow for capital projects, not consumption",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nMr Peter Esele, former President, Trade Union Congress (TUC) has requested the Federal Government to borrow for capital project, rather than for consumption.\n\nEsele, also a public affairs commentator, made the request on Wednesday, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin.\n\nHe was speaking on the backdrop of the 2022 budget proposal recently presented by President Mohammadu Buhari to the National Assembly (NASS).\n\nHe noted that from the proposed budget, it was evident that the country was borrowing for consumption rather than for capital projects.\n\nThis, he said, was evident in the comparison between the proposed allocations for recurrent and capital expenditure.\n\nHe noted that the recurrent expenditure in the proposed budget was almost half of the entire budget.\n\nAccording to him, this was not a recipe for sustainable development, because with recurrent expenditure taking larger chunk of the total budget it showed that the country was borrowing to fund its consumption.\n\nPresident Buhari had on Oct. 7, presented a proposed budget of N16.39 trillion before the National Assembly for 2022, fiscal year.\n\nA breakdown of the budget had shown that N6.83 trillion would be spent on recurrent expenditure while N5.35 trillion would be spent on capital expenditure.\n\nEsele, therefore, said if the country was serious about development, there was need for a reduction in the recurrent expenditure.\n\nHe noted that in other parts of the world recurrent expenditures were not more than 20 per cent of budgets.\n\n\u201cSo, if you are spending so much on recurrent like it\u2019s evident in the 2022 proposal, then what do you have left for development?\n\n\u201cLooking at the budget for capital expenditure, it is as if we are treading on water.\u201cI am not saying that there will be no progress, but where the world is making five steps forward, we will be making just a step, which means we would not be making progress as we should.\u201d\n\nThe former TUC president also noted that the debt servicing by the country was equally high.\n\nHe, therefore, advised for a pro-active action by the government in managing the nation\u2019s debt.\n\nHe, however, lauded President Buhari for prioritisiing Security and Education in 2022 budget proposal, noting that three fundamental sectors, which include education, security and health drove a country.\n\nHe stressed that those three sectors were foundational because if they were well laid out, it would become easier for investors to bring their investment to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nALSO READ: Nnamdi Kanu trial: Former Anambra gov, Ezeife, barred from entering court premises\n\n\u201cAfter prioritising these three, infrastructure is expected to be next, because ordinarily, a robust, healthy and educated society would guarantee everything and it\u2019s a panacea for growth.\n\n\u201cAdequate security gives room for investors to invest in your country and aid development, but without security, there will be no investment, and then poverty thrives.\n\n\u201cTalking about eradicating poverty, when allocation for Social Development/poverty eradication is higher than allocation for health it means you are dealing with the symptom and not the cause.\n\n\u201cSo, it would be appropriate to deal with the cause of a problem rather than treating the symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nEsele said that with huge budgetary allocation for Social Development/poverty eradication, the citizens should know those who had benefitted from it.\n\nHe, therefore, advised that there was need for accurate records and data to be made available for Nigerians and to also know the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), in order to know its benefits to the economy.\n\nThe former TUC president also faulted the huge allocation to the national assembly.\n\nAccording to him allocating N134 billion to the NASS is way too much, because it amount to spending a whooping 0.82 per cent of our total budget on just 456 persons.\n\n\u201cThis means it\u2019s costing the country more than N200 million to maintain each NASS member.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s ask ourselves what are they spending such amount of money for and on?\u201cThat is why they have not been able to earn the respect of Nigerians because each time they act as if they are above the law and appropriate whatever they like to themselves.\n\n\u201cNigerians should begin to ask questions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further noted that the country\u2019s budgetary system was opaque as some of the things budgeted for in 2020 were budgeted for again in 2021, and were still included in the proposed budget.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

However, this cannot be achieved without the commitment, financial and otherwise of every Member State.\n\n\u201cWe must all join forces and strive to ensure that we constantly uphold the ideals and objectives upon which the MoU was established. For this reason, I urge all Member States to play their part in contributing towards the growth of the Abuja MoU, so that we can constantly meet with expectations and safeguard our marine domains,\u201d he said.\n\nAmaechi however thanked Member states for ensuring that the Abuja MoU performed well in the face of COVID-19 and urged them not to relent in their commitments to inspections, trainings and overall contributions.\n\n\u201cI must thank most of our Member States for their performance and swift responses in declaring seafarers as key workers and in lending their support to ensure that the impact of COVID- 19 did not disrupt global shipping. While it is to be noted that the resulting effect of the pandemic slowed down inspection of vessels, nonetheless, based on our 2020 Report, the Abuja MoU performed relatively well in the inspection of vessels that called at our Ports,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Ghana\u2019s Minister of Transportation and Chairman of Abuja MoU, Hon. Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, in his opening speech said \u201cPort State Control acts as an important safety-net to eliminate the operation of sub-standard ships to ensure the needed safety. It is therefore refreshing to note that notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic, our performance as Flag States have been very encouraging.\n\nHe called on member states to \u201cprioritize the vaccination of seafarers, their off and on signings, especially in the repatriation process, and ensure strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols to protect PSCOs and Crew of vessels visiting their ports.\n\nAsiamah also stated that member states \u201cmust be guided by the IMO\u2019s Code of Good Practice for Port State Control Officers and other relevant circulars and Statutory Documents in conducting inspections within the Framework of the Regional Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement on Port State Control,\u201d while ensuring that their PSCOs are empowered to safely conduct inspections, \u201cand to always aim at exceeding the agreed 15per cent minimum number of foreign vessels that call at our ports. States should also accept and endorse the IMO\u2019s guidelines on Cyber Security as part of the Safety Management Codes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ghanian Minister also called on women to explore careers in PSC and other related fields as according to him, \u201cWomen are great agents of change.\u201d He tasked member states to create avenues for the participation of women as Port State Control Officers.\n\nOther Ministers at the meeting include Sierra Leone\u2019s Minister of Transport and Aviation, Hon. Kabineh Kallon and Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Transportation, Sen. Gbemisola Ruquayya Saraki among others participating online.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Cooking gas: Consumers lament rising cost, fear reduction not in sight",
          "text": "As the cost of cooking gas continues to soar, consumers have lamented the situation blaming it on the inability of the government to enact legislation that would make Nigeria a total gas-producing country with less reliance on importation.\n\nNigerians, who bared their minds in Osogbo, revealed to DAILY POST that cooking gas is gradually becoming a luxury commodity because it is slipping out of the reach of the average Nigerian.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Emmanuel Alade, a development expert, predicted that before the end of 2021, cooking gas may become too expensive, forcing many to resort to using charcoal as an alternative means of cooking.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen the recession hit in late 2015 to early 2016, many households were forced to resort to charcoal and firewood as a means of cooking.\n\n\u201cIt had to be so because kerosene became more expensive than cooking gas and since gas was cheaper then, many households opted for cooking gas until conditions made it impossible to continue.\n\n\u201cNow, Nigeria is not in recession but the price of cooking gas is becoming outrageously expensive. Fill this month and by the time you go back next month, you won\u2019t get it at the amount of the last time.\u201d\n\nHe attributed the high cost of cooking gas to importation and the fact Nigeria has stopped being a producer nation but more of a consumer one.\n\n\u201cWe began the year 2021 on a sound note. Cooking gas was selling for between N300 to N350 per kilogramme but now it\u2019s N650 per kilogramme with the possibility of even increasing before the year ends,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going from here?\u201d\n\nCorroborating, a marketer, Mrs. Latifat Oyewale speaking on the development ascribed the increasing price of cooking gas to increase in foreign exchange and Value Added Tax.\n\nOyewale explained that it was no secret that the government had increased the tax on the importation of cooking gas to 7.5 per cent.\n\nShe stated that the high exchange rate which has made Naira be at a disadvantage with the US Dollar is a factor that has hit the business hard and has made many retailers leave the business.\n\nAccording to her, the price has not been constant also and it depended on the foreign exchange.\n\nA retailer, Adetayo Adekunle told DAILY POST that he is considering leaving the business for another one.\n\nAccording to him, it does not pay him anymore as he has to be adding extra money each time he goes to fill at the depot.\n\nHe lamented the fact that consumers have been dwindling by the day.\n\n\u201cIf I feel my bottle N50,00:00 this month, and sell at that rate, by the time I go back to the depot, I will have to cough out more to fill my bottle and when I tell my customers, some won\u2019t believe me but nevertheless will buy but they won\u2019t come around again to buy from me,\u201d he said.\n\nIndustry watchers are indicating that there is the possibility that the cost of cooking gas may increase further by the year\u2019s ending.\n\nA consumer in Osogbo, Comfort Nwakpe, a housewife, stated that since the beginning of June, there was no time she goes to fill her cylinder without an increase in the price of cooking gas.\n\nShe revealed that she was considering the next option as what she encountered each time she filled her cooking gas cylinder was eating deep into her budget and exceeding her expectations.\n\nAn Osogbo-based food vendor, Ronke Iyunade, stated that the increase in cooking gas came at a period when there was an equal rise in foodstuff which has made her daily revenue drop.\n\nLamenting the situation, she however expressed optimism that things may get better and that is the reason she will press on with her business.\n\nSamuel Abolarinwa called on the government to re-introduce the price control system adding that with such in place, cooking gas will be cheap and affordable to many Nigerians who still see it as a means of cooking.\n\nHe decried the situation where students who had been used to the cooking gas as a means of cooking because of its affordability would have no other option but to use charcoal stoves and firewoods.\n\nHe told this reporter that he has since switched to a kerosene stove as a measure to cut down on the high cost of cooking gas adding that the switch was not palatable.",

The Court of Appeal stated that: \u201cIn present-day Nigeria, clearly police permit has outlived its usefulness.\n\n\u201cIt is the right of citizens to conduct peaceful processions, rallies or demonstrations without seeking and obtaining permission from anybody. It is a right guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution and any law that attempts to curtail such right is null and void and of no consequence,\u201d Oyinlade said.\n\n\u201cThe rationale for police refusal to implement the 2007 court ruling on the Public Order Act suggests that the police in Nigeria focus largely on what they perceive law to be against what the law truly is.\u201d\n\nOyinlade told the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, to alert the police hierarchy nationwide on the position of law on the subject matter and order total compliance.\n\nThe lawyer demanded that innocent Nigerians arrested and/or detained for exercising their right to protest should be freed immediately.\n\nOyinlade recently won the 2021 American Bar Association (ABA) International Human Rights Laureate.

It is a reflection of our warm and cordial bilateral relations that this is the second time I\u2019ve had the pleasure of receiving my brother in Abuja.\n\n\u201cDuring the visit, we had very useful discussions on a number of bilateral issues, aimed at strengthening this cordial relationship between Nigeria and Turkey. The key issues we touched on included a series of bilateral agreements and Memoranda of Understanding that have been finalised.\n\n\u201cAs a positive outcome, eight major agreements, MoU on a number of the key sectors, including energy, defense, industry, mining, and hydrocarbons, among others, were signed today. We have agreed that implementation is to commence immediately.\n\n\u201cIn the course of our discussions, we also reviewed the travel ban based on the revised COVID-19 protocols, and removed Turkey from Nigeria\u2019s travel ban list. Turkey has indeed achieved remarkable success in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President commended President Erdogan for providing a safe haven for about four million refugees, who had to flee their war-torn home countries in search to peace and safety.\n\nOn his part, speaking in his native Turkish language and interpreted by one of the officials on his entourage, President Erdogan recognised Nigeria as one of the oldest allies of Turkey in Africa, having seen 60 years of diplomatic ties.\n\nAccording to him, steps would immediately be taken to expand the trade volume between the two countries to $5 billion, as the $2 billion mark achieved last year could not be said to be substantial enough.\n\nHe said: \u201cThanks for the bilateral discussions we\u2019ve had with Nigerian President, Mr. Buhari, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to observe and to assess all aspects and dimensions of the relations between Turkey and Nigeria and we had also exchanged our opinions and impressions as to how much further we can develop and strengthen our relations between our two countries. It gives me great pleasure to confirm once again that in terms of expanding our cooperation between the two nations, we share the same resolves.\n\n\u201cWe shall be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two nations and Nigeria hosts one of the oldest diplomatic missions of the Republic of Turkey on the African continent. Nigeria is one of the outstanding members of international organisations, such as the G8, OIC, ECOWAS and the African Union, as well as being one of the most leading countries of both this region, and the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cWe should appreciate the tremendous efforts of Nigeria with eventual goal of bringing peace, stability, and economic development to the entire African continent. Nigeria holds the manufacturing position of the entire continent, and our trade volume between the two nations reached $2 billion last year. Thus, Nigeria became our most outstanding and the biggest trade partner in the sub-Saharan Africa for the Republic of Turkey.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still believe that this level we have achieved is far from being adequate. We hope and pray that we will be expanding our trade volume up to $5 billion immediately. We hope and pray that the relations between the two nations will be further developed on the basis of a win-win scenario, and on the basis of mutual respect\u201d.\n\nOn the beneficial ties between Turkey and Africa, especially Nigeria, President Erdogan said, \u201cwe\u2019ll keep on converging with the African continent as Republic of Turkey on every dimension possible. All relations are based upon the foundation of strategic partnership, and we are gaining new momentum every time we visit the continent.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the number of our diplomatic missions on the African continent up to 43 recently. The third round of the Turkish-African Business Forum will be hosted in Istanbul on October 21, and the 22nd, only to be followed by hosting of the third Turkish-African Partnership Summit on December 17, and 18th. We are committed to expanding our relations and our cooperation further with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt also gives me great pleasure to be able to observe that many Nigerian youngsters are pursuing their further education, not only in Turkey, but also in the universities of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and it gives me great pleasure to observe that they\u2019re also benefiting from the turkey scholarships available to them\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Turkish President used the forum to request Nigeria\u2019s collaboration with Turkey in the fight against terrorism in both countries, noting particularly that his nation had been following Nigeria\u2019s fight against insecurity, particularly the activities of terrorists.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs Turkey, we have been closely monitoring the developments unfolding in Nigeria, our brotherly and friendly nation. The terrorist organisations, the armed gangs and the marine bandits are continuously active in Nigeria and the Nigerian authorities are continuously fighting against them. So, in order to cooperate further in the fields of military, defense, and security, we are doing everything that will be available.\n\n\u201cOn this occasion, I also would like to take this opportunity, once again, to extend my most heartfelt condolences to our brothers and sisters of Nigeria, who have lost their lives as a result of terrorist attacks and I hope and pray that Allah will bestow upon those who stay behind, the utmost patience and strength.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to share our ever-expanding capabilities, as the Republic of Turkey, with Nigeria, especially in the field of defense industry and security, which are being praised by the entire globe.\n\n\u201cThis sensitivity that we showcase in fighting terrorism, I hope, will be reciprocated by our Nigerian brothers and sisters and our counterparts. As we\u2019re probably aware of the fact that Turkey has been fighting against terrorist organisations for many decades, such as the PKK, PYD, FETO, DASH and other terrorist organisations.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrator of the heinous failed coup of July the 15th, FETO, is still illegally active in Nigeria, and we are continuously sharing our intelligence with the Nigerian interlocutors and authorities. I hope and pray that our Nigerian brothers will forge a closer solidarity in this field with us, the Republic of Turkey. I hope and pray that our visit will yield the most auspicious results\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says President Buhari has allowed the rot to deepen\n\n\u2022Warns country sliding into failed state\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report\n\nThe Economist has expressed concerns about how kidnappers, zealots and rebels are making Nigeria ungovernable, highlighting the rising incidence of insecurity across the country.\n\nThe London-based newspaper, noted in a report that in the north-east, a jihadist insurgency was spreading; rebellion was brewing in the south-east, pointing out that across most of the country, the rich and poor alike live in fear of kidnappers, warlords or cattle rustlers.\n\nEven the sea provides no haven: the Gulf of Guinea is the world\u2019s hotspot for piracy, it stated.\n\nAccording to the report, the country was growing ever harder to live or work in.\n\nThe report disclosed that the share of adults in Nigeria that told Gallup that they wanted to emigrate permanently had risen from 41 per cent in 2012 to 48 per cent in 2018.\n\n\u201cAmong the young, a clear majority wish to leave. Shell, an oil giant that was long Nigeria\u2019s biggest foreign investor, and which stuck around during the grimmest years of military rule, recently said it would pull out, citing the threat of violence. The army has now been deployed to every one of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\n\u201cSecurity [in Nigeria] is at its worst since the civil war,\u201d it quoted Cheta Nwanze of SBM Intelligence, a consultancy in Lagos, to have said.\n\nThis, the report described as a startling claim, stating that the Biafran war of 1967-70, when the Igbos of the south-east tried but failed to secede from Nigeria, claimed an estimated one million lives.\n\n\u201cSince then, Nigeria has held together. The country of 200 million people has had mountains of problems, from corruption and ethnic strife to a series of military dictators. But it has been democratic since 1999. And parts of it are thriving, especially in the south-west. Lagos, the commercial capital, is home to vigorous banks, a hip technology scene and a flourishing film industry, Nollywood,\u201d The Economist stated.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not yet a failed state, but large parts of it are failing. This matters not only because one sub-Saharan African in six is Nigerian. The country also has Africa\u2019s largest economy, whose dire performance holds the continent back. And its conflicts are spilling across borders, destabilising fragile neighbours such as Niger and Chad and amplifying the jihadist threat across the Sahel.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s instability is largely born of poor governance. Britain, the colonial power, lumped together many groups in one country: Muslims in the north, Christians in the south, numerous and overlapping ethnic groups in different regions.\n\n\u201cPolitics has long been a tussle to grab petrodollars, the source of nearly all government revenues. All groups gripe that they are short-changed. Most are right\u2014a corrupt elite grabs a huge portion, leaving only scraps for ordinary Nigerians of any group.\n\n\u201cSince politics is the swiftest route to wealth, it is a violent business, cursed by candidates who drum up ethnic or religious strife to win support. What has changed in recent years is that the government has grown so rotten that it struggles to control wide swathes of territory.\n\n\u201cTo understand how, start in the north-east. In 2009 a jihadist insurgency erupted there. The jihadists called themselves Boko Haram (\u201cwestern education is sinful\u201d). They were fed up with predatory government, eager to establish a theocracy, and not averse to seizing loot and women. Their insurgency has directly cost some 35,000 lives, plus another 314,000 from war-induced disease and hunger, estimates the UNDP.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 they nearly captured Maiduguri, the biggest city in the north-east. A force of mercenaries, reinforced by Nigeria\u2019s army, pushed them back into isolated swamps and forests,\u201d it explained.\n\nIt alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari, has failed to address the situation, stating that over the past six years the jihadists have regrouped in the countryside, hoisting their black flags over village after village.\n\n\u201cNow they are once more threatening Maiduguri, this time under the banner of Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), an offshoot of Boko Haram that now outguns it,\u201d it added.\n\nISWAP is \u201cmuch more dangerous\u201d to the Nigerian state, Vincent Foucher of International Crisis Group (ICG), a Brussels-based think-tank stated.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s unofficial strategy now seems to be to contain the jihadists, rather than to try to defeat them. The government has deployed enough force to control the biggest towns and to escort convoys along the main roads, but not enough to hold, much less govern, the smaller towns and villages. The army is thinly stretched. Trying to pacify the north-east is only one of its problems,\u201d it added.\n\nIt stressed that kidnappers have made life perilous in much of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn July gunmen shot up a hospital in Kaduna and kidnapped ten people, including two babies. In August, audacious bandits attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy, the equivalent of West Point, killing two soldiers and grabbing a major.\n\n\u201cA startling 1,400 schoolchildren and students have been kidnapped this year. After one such incident in September, schools and markets were closed across Zamfara. The government also shut telephone networks and imposed a curfew. All told, about 1m Nigerian students are out of school because of insecurity.\n\n\u201cMost of the rest are nervous. A security guard at a university in south-west Nigeria checked the boot of your correspondent\u2019s taxi. It is \u201cin case we kidnapped students\u201d, explained the driver.\n\n\u201cThe army is trying to fight back, especially in Zamfara. But it often does so indiscriminately; for example, by calling in air strikes,\u201d it added.\n\nFurthermore, it pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s third big security threat was in the south-east, where separatists had been trying to revive Biafra.\n\n\u201cMany Igbos feel marginalised and ill-treated by the central government. (As do most people in Nigeria.) The main separatist group, the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), is demanding a Biafra that includes all of Nigeria\u2019s main oil-producing states, even the ones where Igbos are a minority,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the report, even in the south-west, the most prosperous part of Nigeria (bar the capital), separatist feelings were starting to spread, citing the agitation by Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cA dire economy makes taking up arms more tempting. In 2019 some 80 million Nigerians lived on less than $2 a day. More than half of Nigerians are unemployed or underemployed. Food inflation is 21 per cent.\n\n\u201cBad policies, such as closing land borders to goods entirely in 2019 in the hope of spurring local production, have deepened the pain. The government has made little effort to wean itself off oil, or to prepare for a future when cleaner forms of energy ultimately replace it.\n\n\u201cAnother cause for optimism is that millions of Nigerians still manage to thrive, despite the chaos. Some start businesses to get around government failures. Security firms are booming, unsurprisingly. So are start-ups. Lagos boasts three fintech firms worth over $1bn each. Most Nigerians would rather earn a living peacefully than fight,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Protesters hold car procession at Lekki Tollgate, demand justice, say brutality continues\n\n\u2022Police disrupt march to National Assembly\n\n\u2022We did not stop demonstrators, Lagos insists\n\n\u2022Okowa inaugurates human rights protection committee\n\n\u2022Afenifere challenges FG to fulfil promises\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja; Chiemelie Ezeobi, Segun James, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos; Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt; Fidelis David in Akure; Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba; and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe youth of the nation made good their threat to hold memorial marches yesterday commemorating those who died during the nationwide anti-police brutality protests last year. This was despite warnings by the Nigeria Police that marches to mark the one year anniversary of the #EndSARs protest would not be condoned.\n\nAs the memorial rallies held in some states yesterday, the National Economic Council (NEC) directed state governors to forward final reports of the panels of inquiry into the protests to their Attorneys-General for prompt arraignment and prosecution of the indicted persons.\n\nIn Lagos State, youths gathered at the Lekki tollgate to mark the EndSARs anniversary. But the rally was marred by police brutality and clampdown on journalists covering the peaceful event.\n\nIn Abuja, security operatives acting on the order of Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, pushed a procession to the National Assembly complex back.\n\nBut Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, yesterday, inaugurated a Committee for the Protection of Human Rights in the state with an appeal for more citizen participation in peace and nation building.\n\nIn Rivers State, over 200 youths staged a candlelight procession at the popular Waterline junction in Port Harcourt.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed, who revealed the decision of NEC in Abuja, during a media briefing, also accused those he labelled \u201cchampions of a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate,\u201d including Amnesty International and CNN, of holding on to \u201ctheir unproven stand.\u201d\n\nThe federal government said where incidents in the inquests related to matters of discipline, in addition to prosecution, NEC had urged the Nigeria Police to take disciplinary action against the affected officers in line with the provisions of the Police Act 2020.\n\nMohammed spoke on measures that had been taken to improve the efficiency of the police and other security agencies\u2019 architecture. He explained that NEC had called on the leadership of the security agencies to ensure that persons recruited into arms-bearing security organs underwent psychiatric evaluation and drug test before enlistment.\n\nHe also said personnel of the agencies had been advised to dutifully observe rules of engagement in the discharge of their duties.\n\nWhile acknowledging the various initiatives introduced by the federal government to strengthen police accountability through the Police Service Commission, the minister said the council had urged the government to prioritise the general welfare of security agencies.\n\n\u201cIn particular, it advocated the review of pension and gratuity of retired police officers and attainment of parity of remuneration by police officers with sister security agencies,\u201d he stated.\n\nMohammed also said the council advised the government to \u201cundertake a comprehensive assessment of all police stations across the country with a view to ensuring that they are fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cNigeria Police Force and other security agencies should deploy cutting-edge technology in the fight against crimes.\u201d\n\nThe council also urged the police to ensure that all those detained as a result of the #EndSars protests were expeditiously processed with due regard to the principles of fair hearing.\n\nHowever, the federal government maintained its stance that there were no evidence of massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate a year ago.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cToday marks the first anniversary of the phantom massacre at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, which was the culmination of an otherwise peaceful protest that was later hijacked by hoodlums.\n\n\u201cAt earlier press conferences, I had called the reported massacre at the toll gate the farce. On Monday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was set up by the Lagos State Government after the #EndSARS protest wrapped up its sitting.\n\n\u201cDuring the sitting, CNN was summoned but it never showed up, thus, missing a great opportunity to prove its allegation of massacre at the toll gate. Also, Amnesty International had a golden opportunity to convince the world, but it rather opted for issuing meaningless press releases.\u201d\n\nMohammed claimed that in its latest attempt to grasp at straws and, \u201credeem whatever is left of its battered credibility on this issue, CNN has continued with its baseless report that soldiers shot at protesters.\n\n\u201cIn a report currently running on the network, CNN brazenly and unashamedly held on to its flawed narrative, relying on an unidentified mother whose son was reportedly shot dead at Lekki, but without convincing evidence of who shot him dead.\u201d\n\nThe minister said the federal government remained proud of the security agencies for acting professionally and showing utmost restraint all through the #EndSARS protest and the ensuing violence, an action he said saved lives and property.\n\nPolice Clampdown on Journalists, Brutalise Protesters in Lagos\n\nMeanwhile, in Lagos, Nigeria Police officers, who ignored warnings to abide by the rules of engagement, unleashed violence on peaceful protesters, passers-by, and even journalists deployed to cover the commemoration.\n\nThe operatives from the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and the state taskforce were seen assaulting people gathered at the tollgate, as well as road users.\n\nThose who bore the brunt of yesterday\u2019s crude actions by the Nigeria Police in Lagos included an Uber driver, Clement Adedotun; Arise Television crew; an online reporter, Bisola Alawode, and another lady simply identified as Blessing.\n\nThe police also forced many at the rally into their waiting Black Maria after using tear gas at close proximity to spray their faces.\n\nThe security operatives, comprising the RRS, Taskforce and Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps (LNSC), had brutalised and arrested Alawode and a lone protester before whisking them away to an unknown destination.\n\nAttempts by protesters to resist arrest were met by more force by the security operatives.\n\nThe Uber driver, whose torture video went viral, said he had a passenger in his cab when they heard gunshots.\n\nHe said, \u201cI abandoned my vehicle and fled. The passenger ran as well. When the situation calmed down, I returned to take my vehicle but couldn\u2019t find it.\n\n\u201cI asked questions around where I had left the vehicle and I was told to go and meet the security operatives because they towed vehicles off. That was how I came here and the next thing they started forcing me into this truck.\n\n\u201cI cannot enter it because I am not a thief. No member of my family has ever entered it. It won\u2019t be me that will enter. I did not do anything. I am not even a protester.\u201d\n\nPrior to the acts of brutality, the youths led by Music Star, Folarin Falana, alias Falz, and Comedian Adebowale Adedayo (Mr. Macaroni), were in their vehicles waving the Nigerian flag and chanting #ENDSARS as they drove through the tollgate repeatedly.\n\nHowever, things turned violent when the procession was about to end. While some dropped off their flags, others refused to vacate, thereby causing traffic congestion.\n\nThe police were said to have blocked off the tollgate and diverted traffic before they used teargas to disperse the crowd, while vehicles parked on the road were towed away and the tollgate reopened.\n\nIn the ensuing melee, it was alleged that a thug stabbed a Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps official and fled, while the operatives arrested some persons with cutlass, hammers and charms at the venue.\n\nLagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, got those wrongfully arrested freed, just as he tendered public apology to those who were brutalised.\n\nAddressing journalists at the scene, Odumosu said the security operatives had to use minimal force when they discovered that miscreants had infiltrated the crowd.\n\n\u201cNo one stopped the car procession. I told them that no one would harass them as long as they do not obstruct traffic because this is a business area and not a park or garden. They were free to have their banners, stickers on their cars and drive pass as many times as they wanted to, which they did.\n\n\u201cI put a call across to one of the organisers to know if they were done and he said yes, that they were through and on their way. I asked if it was true they had another event at Alausa and were going there but he said no, that they had dispersed.\n\n\u201cSo, you can see that the protesters who have leaders have concluded their exercise and left. These ones who came to block the road now are not known. They do not have leaders and are not organised. That is not to say they cannot protest since peaceful protest is the right of every Nigerian.\n\n\u201cWhat we will not allow is disruption of movement or the infringement on the rights of others because where one person\u2019s right stops, another\u2019s starts. Now, you can see we have arrested some of them with weapons. Are those protesters?\n\nThe youths said they were angry with the Lagos State government for trying to stop yesterday\u2019s protest, saying it amounts to gross violation of their human rights.\n\nBut the Lagos State government denied the allegation of trying to stop protesters.\n\nLagos State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, said the governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had no control over police activities in Lagos, and could not order the police to stop any protest in the state. The Lagos State Police Commissioner reports directly to the Inspector General of Police in Abuja and not to the Lagos State government.\n\nOmotosho spoke yesterday on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d, an ARISE NEWS Channel programme, alongside the founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, Mr. Atedo Peterside, as well as a lawyer and civil rights advocate, Mr. Inibehe Effiong. The information commissioner said different agitations coming from Lagos and other parts of the country since the #EndSARs protest last year had tended to divide the people of the state.\n\nHe called for peace, unity and understanding among Lagos youth and, by extension, Nigerian youth, adding that the youth need to collaborate with government to build the country and not disrupt activities and destroy the common wealth of the country.\n\nOmotosho said, \u201cLagos State Government encourages freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest. I was with the Lagos State Governor three days ago, when he made a call to the owner of Landmark Centre, when #EndSars youths visited him, to complain about how the management of Landmark Centre suddenly reneged on an earlier agreement they had reached with them to use the centre for the one year remembrance of #EndSars protest.\n\n\u201cDuring the telephone conversation between the governor and the owner of Landmark Centre, which I recorded, the owner of Landmark Centre denied getting any instruction from Lagos government to decline the commercial request of the youths to use the centre for their protest. He told the governor that the decision was taken by the management to save lives and property and that it was a pure business decision.\n\n\u201cSo it is wrong for anybody to think that Lagos State government must have instructed the managers of Landmark Centre to stop the youths from using the venue for their protest.\u201d\n\nAsked why protesters were arrested and journalists were rough handled and their drones and cameras seized by the police during yesterday\u2019s protest in Lagos, Omotosho said, \u201cLagos State governor did not ask the police to stop any protest and arrest protesters and seize the working tools of journalists covering the protest. \u201c\n\nWorried by the action of the police during the protest, Effiong accused the government of insensitivity to the challenges of the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe police cannot deviate in their role to protect the rights of the protesters. Civilians laid down their lives for Nigeria\u2019s democracy when they confronted the military years back and we cannot have a Commissioner of Police in Lagos who will not give instructions to the police to protect peaceful protesters.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Sanwo-Olu cannot compel the Lagos State Police Commissioner to respect the rights of the people, the governor must write to President Muhammadu Buhari, the Police Service Commission and request the redeployment of the Lagos State Commissioner of Police. Until he has done that, the governor must take full responsibility of the violations of Lagos youths, the harassment of journalists in Lagos and the continued disdain to the rule of law and democracy in Lagos.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Peterside advised the youth to unite in fighting their course and choose leaders among them who would represent them to dialogue with government in pushing their demands.\n\n\u201cThe best way to bring about change in a country is through dialogue and there must be leaders who are willing and able to dialogue with government,\u201d Peterside said.\n\nPolice Stop #ENDSARS Protest March to National Assembly\n\nA procession towards the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, led by the publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, was stopped. The protesters were walking towards the perimeter gate of the complex when they were intercepted by a detachment of policemen, near the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe police interception subsequently forced the procession to beat a retreat to Unity Fountain, along Shehu Shagari Way, Maitama, where they continued their protest, which was largely peaceful.\n\nThe presence of anti-riot policemen, soldiers and members of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps prevented the protest from degenerating into violence.\n\nMost of the protesters were clad in black outfits that reflected the mood of the occasion.\n\nThe slogan, \u201cWe will Not Forget 2010 20 Lekki Massacre\u201d, was boldly inscribed on their outfits.\n\nThey held various anti-government placards, some of which read: \u201cThe Liberator Generation is Here\u201d, \u201cYoung Not Criminal\u201d, \u201cWhy Does It Look Like it is a Crime to be a Nigerian\u201d, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Kill Nobody\u201d, \u201cWe Can\u2019t Be the Future of the Nation, if We Are Dead\u201d.\n\nHowever, a few metres from the #EndSARS protesters in Abuja, a pro-government group gathered close to the security operatives and also unfurled a banner describing the shooting of protesters at Lekki as a hoax. They carried banners with inscriptions such as: \u201cEndSARS was an insurrection against the state\u201d.\n\nThe pro-Buhari protesters stormed the Unity Fountain ground around 10:30 a.m. and berated the #EndSARS memorial protesters for being too critical of the Buhari government.\n\nThe pro-Buhari group also accused the #EndSARS protesters of projecting Nigeria in a bad light before the world through their mass action in Lagos, Abuja and other major cities in the country. They alleged the #EndSARS memorial protest was a ploy to instigate an unlawful change of government.\n\n\u201cWe have come here because we found out that some miscreants hiding behind #EndSARS have planned to come here to hold #EndSARS memorial,\u201d their leader said.\n\nLater in the day, the anti-government protesters held a solemn candlelight memorial in honour of the victims of Lekki shooting and all those who died during the protest across the country.\n\nOkowa Inaugurates Human Rights Protection Committee\n\nOkowa, yesterday, inaugurated a Committee for the Protection of Human Rights in the state with an appeal for more citizen participation in peace and nation building.\n\nThe governor was the head of the new committee, which he inaugurated in Asaba yesterday, as part of the recommendations of the Justice Celestina Ogisi Judicial Panel of Inquiry on police brutality and extrajudicial killings in the state.\n\nMembers of the Committee included the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Isaiah Bozimo; Commissioner for Youth Development, Ifeanyi Egwunyenga; Solicitor-General/Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Mr. Omamuzo Erebe; and the Commissioner of Police in the state.\n\nOthers were representative of the youth, Mr. Harrison Gwamnishu; representative of civil societies organisations, Israel Joe; representative of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Dr. Jonathan Ekpenisi; representative of National Human Rights Commission, Mr. Alpheus Ngwu; and Permanent Secretary, Directorate of Political and Security Matters, Mr. Theophilus Aguonye, who would serve as Secretary.\n\nHe thanked God for His intervention in restoring peace following the anti-SARS protest, which he admitted shook the country significantly.\n\nOkowa said, \u201cWe saw a lot of our youths come out in anger against so many issues as it concerned the nation but particularly against police brutality.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of destruction of property as the movements of various civil society groups and youths got hijacked by unscrupulous citizens of this nation.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the youths who actually set out at the beginning for the protest meant well for this nation because they were actually there to draw the attention of the leadership of this nation both at the national and at the sub-national levels to the ills in the society.\n\n\u201cThey said they were demonstrating against oppressive tendencies of security agencies, which were impinging on their freedom.\u201d\n\nOkowa revealed that a lot of discussions took place and in one of the meetings at NEC, headed by the vice president, as chairman, decisions were taken that were far-reaching and they helped to douse the tension.\n\nHe said the decisions included the need to carry out some enquiry into the issues raised as to police brutality and to also find ways and means of assuaging the nerves of those who may have suffered one loss or the other.\n\n\u201cThis state and many other states commissioned panels of inquiry to look into the issues of police brutality and extra-judicial killings.\n\n\u201cThe panel itself had finished its sitting and the report was sent to my office and eventually a white paper was prepared from the report and decisions were taken just recently at the State Executive Council meeting.\n\n\u201cWe are very mindful of the fact that we cannot pay for lives lost but we have agreed at the council on the need to show some respect and to also find means of assuaging the nerves of those who have lost loved ones and for those who had to go to hospitals following action from police brutality.\n\n\u201cThese decisions have been taken and we look forward that at the end of this month the monies, which Exco has approved, should be paid to the various families that were affected.\u201d\n\nYouths Stage Candlelight Procession in Port Harcourt\n\nIn Rivers, over 200 youths yesterday, staged a candlelight procession at the popular waterline junction in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nThe youths, who were peaceful during the procession, alleged that one year after, no action had been taken to penalise police officers indicted in the report by the #EndSARS panel.\n\nChairman, Rivers State Civil Society Organisation (RSCSO) and Convener of the #EndSARS procession, Enefaa Georgewill, stated that police officers alleged to be involved in the brutality of young people across the state were yet to be prosecuted.\n\nEnefaa added, \u201cThe people are saying that enough is enough. We cannot continue to live in a state of fear. We are demanding that the state should implement its panel called the EndSARS panel.\n\n\u201cUntil now, the police officer who caused bodily harm and killed young people are yet to be prosecuted. We are saying the people they say they will compensate are yet to be compensated.\n\n\u201c#EndSARS is beyond just ending a police unit called SARS, it is a metaphor for evil in our society. It is a symbol for misrule.\u201d\n\nThe youths carried placards with various inscriptions like; \u201cno protester will die in vain under our watch\u201d.\n\nYour Boys are Back on the Streets, Protesters Tell IGP in Ondo\n\nSimilarly, in Akure, scores of youth from across Ondo State held a memorial procession to mark one year anniversary of the event. The protesters reminded the Inspector General of Police that his \u201cboys\u201d were back in the streets, alleging that the officers are not after armed robbers, bandits, kidnappers but they are after Nigerian youth.\n\nThe protesters, who gathered outside the entrance of the Akure City Hall, amid a heavy presence of police officers, walked through Oba-Adeshida Road, passing through NEPA roundabout to the Police Command Headquarters, Akure.\n\nAddressing journalists, the leader of the protesters, Tope Temokun, said, \u201cThe memorial protest is to honour our slain heroes, to demand that our government must continue to tell us the truth, because our government has been feeding us with lies over the years.\n\n\u201cOur coming out today after a year of the protest to end brutality in Nigeria, both from the police and the government, is to remind the government that we need only one thing from them and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cWe came out on October 20, 2020 to protest against brutality and they told us we were going to get justice, they told us they were going to get to the truth and redress and that victims will get compensation but after one year, we are still in the street.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing today is brutality from government and the police. We have submitted petition to the government of Akeredolu to implement the recommendation of #EndSARS panel that was submitted to him to address the grievances of the protesters.\u201d\n\nHe said the youth were not tired of standing up to challenge all forms of injustice.\n\nAfenifere Challenges FG to Fulfil Promises\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, yesterday urged the federal government to fulfil it promises to youths during the protests last year. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, Afenifere said the high handed manner with which the police treated those who peacefully organised rallies yesterday clearly showed that the government and the police had not demonstrated that the lessons inherent in October 20, 2020, meant nothing to them.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the failure of the government to fulfil the promises made by President Muhammadu Buhari on the issue has added to the list of how the government continues to alienate itself from the people,\u201d he said.\n\nAjayi insisted that one year down the line, with governments setting up panels of inquiry to find out what happened, nothing tangible had come out of it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "This was despite warnings by the Nigeria Police that marches to mark the one year anniversary of the #EndSARs protest would not be condoned.\nIn Lagos State, youths gathered at the Lekki tollgate to mark the EndSARs anniversary.\nOn Monday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was set up by the Lagos State Government after the #EndSARS protest wrapped up its sitting.\nLagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, got those wrongfully arrested freed, just as he tendered public apology to those who were brutalised.\nThe Lagos State Police Commissioner reports directly to the Inspector General of Police in Abuja and not to the Lagos State government.",

          "text": "When the Kaduna Riot erupted in February 2000, the late Chibuike Ikeagwuchi was still in his mother\u2019s womb. The riot, which led to over 200 deaths and many properties destroyed, later extended to Kano, where Chibuike\u2019s parents lived at the time.\n\nAs Chibuike\u2019s mother, Agnes\u2019, due date drew nearer, the riot had intensified. Chibuike\u2019s father, Dominic, decided to prioritize the safety of his wife and family by evacuating them from Kano.\n\nOne night in March 2000, Dominic managed to get his plan of escape in motion. But there was a problem. When he and his family arrived at the Sabon Gari Park, the last bus of the F.G. Onyenwe Transport Company to Owerri was almost full, unable to accommodate all six family members.\n\nDominic decided to put his pregnant wife and four children on the bus so he could stay behind and join them later. He wanted to, as he recalls, \u201callow my wife and children to arrive home safely without any pressure on the pregnancy.\u201d\n\nHis family did arrive safely, and so did he, a month and two weeks later. The family had relocated to their hometown at Oboukwu Obizi in the Ezinihitte local government area of Imo State. There, Chibuike Ikeagwuchi was safely delivered.\n\n\u201cI avoided every trouble. I dogged every bullet,\u201d Dominic remembers. \u201cI did everything I could to make sure that the child was safe and secure.\u201d\n\nBut two decades later, Dominic would not be in the position to protect his son, who was murdered in cold blood.\n\nIt was the afternoon of September 19, 2020. when an officer named Isaiah Bene, attached to the Nigerian Mobile Police Force (MOPOL) at the Elelenwo area of the Obio/Akpor local government in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State, killed Chibuike, who had turned 20 just months before.\n\nChibuike and his friend, identified as Reuben, were reportedly walking along the road when they saw operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian Police Force. Having previously heard and seen atrocities committed by the unit, the two friends started running in fear. The officers chased after them and, when they could not keep up, raised a false alarm with shouts of \u201cthieves! thieves!\u201d\n\nTo avoid being killed, Chibuike and Reuben eventually stopped to explain themselves to the SARS officers, who were still running towards them. During their short wait for the SARS officers to catch up to them, the duo was approached by MOPOL officer Bene, who was stationed in Elelewon.\n\nReuben recalls emptying the bag he was carrying when he heard a gunshot behind him. Chibuike had been shot in the back by Bene and had fallen face down on the ground. The incident was videoed by eyewitnesses and posted on social media.\n\nWhen the SARS operatives finally arrived at the scene, they handcuffed Reuben. At that time, Chibuike was still breathing, but the SARS operatives refused to take him to the hospital. Rather, they put him on the floor of a tricycle where he breathed his last breath around 3:00 pm.\n\nWhile Reuben was taken to the police station, Chibuike was taken to the University of Port Harcourt (UPTH) mortuary.\n\nDominic heard about Chibuike\u2019s shooting from his (Dominic\u2019s) eldest son, Michael. When he heard, he went to the Elelewon police station, where he requested to see his son, but was informed Chibuike was not in their custody.\n\nHe then received a phone call from Reuben\u2019s mother, who told him not to leave the police station. When Reuben\u2019s mother arrived at the station, they were allowed to see Reuben, who told them Chibuike had been killed and taken to the mortuary by the SARS operatives. Dominic slumped.\n\n\u201cI did not know when I fell,\u201d he says.\n\nHe was shocked but also angry that his son had not only been shot, but taken to the mortuary without his consent. \u201cThey allowed my boy to die slowly,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen Dominic got to the UPTH mortuary that evening, the mortuary attendants did not doubt his claim of being the father of the deceased, because of the striking resemblance.\n\nBy the time I saw his body, he was very dark,\u201d Dominic remembers.\n\nThe SARS operatives had apparently dumped Chibuike\u2019s corpse and registered him under the name Daniel Anambra, a 30-year-old accident victim.\n\nDominic took his son\u2019s corpse and travelled to their hometown, where he ensured Chibuike was buried in the family compound on December 21, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe boy was a son I did not know I would lose like that,\u201d the 69-year-old Dominic laments. \u201cHe was not a cultist - it was proven beyond reasonable doubt. Throughout the time of his death till now, I never saw any group come to say he was their member.\u201d\n\nDominic describes his late son, who was his fifth and last child, as a potential music superstar who went by the stage name Sleek. Chibuike, Dominic reveals, was in a group that already had an album to their credit.\n\nIn 2020, Chibuike was admitted to study civil engineering at the Federal University of Owerri (FUTO), but could not attend because of complications caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to being an artist, he also installed aluminium windows and roofs.\n\nOn October 27, 2020, Dominic instituted two separate cases - criminal and human rights - against the Rivers State Command of the Nigerian Police Force in the Rivers State High Court. The human rights case was speedily carried out and on November 27, 2020, Dominic was awarded the sum of 50 million naira for damages. The criminal case was adjourned to April 14, 2021, while officer Bene was remanded in prison.\n\nChibuike\u2019s mother, Agnes, cries as she reflects on her son\u2019s life. \u201cLife has never been the same,\u201d she says, sobbing. \u201cI keep calling his number. I was there when they were burying him but I still call his number [to see] whether he would answer me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough I have other children, the departure of that boy seems as if 20 people left my house,\u201d she adds.\n\nDominic, meanwhile, says the loss of his son has shattered him, almost driving him to insanity. \u201cHis loss disorganized me,\u201d he explains. \u201cSince his loss, I\u2019ve become disoriented.\u201d",
          "summary": "When the SARS operatives finally arrived at the scene, they handcuffed Reuben.\nAt that time, Chibuike was still breathing, but the SARS operatives refused to take him to the hospital.\nWhile Reuben was taken to the police station, Chibuike was taken to the University of Port Harcourt (UPTH) mortuary.\nThe SARS operatives had apparently dumped Chibuike\u2019s corpse and registered him under the name Daniel Anambra, a 30-year-old accident victim.\nChibuike, Dominic reveals, was in a group that already had an album to their credit.",

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential.

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It started a chain of reactions culminating in a midnight call and a new story idea for this month\u2019s Privacy Roundtable.\n\nOn Friday, October 15, 2021, we sent out a tweet asking readers to fill a form for a story on why they do not care about privacy. As you might have already guessed, today\u2019s article has gone off on a tangent. And for this, I apologise to everyone. We will talk about it in next month\u2019s edition.\n\nWhile you are here, please populate the form with your answers.\n\nFor today\u2019s story, our focus would be on data privacy rights and possible exceptions. I paint a picture in the following paragraphs that guides this article\u2019s narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAda is a 24-year-old graduate with a theatre arts degree. If there\u2019s one thing she loves, it\u2019s talking to her friends on the phone. She could spend the whole day doing that. Perhaps, that\u2019s why she\u2019s unemployed.\n\nA few days ago, she saw a trending post on Twitter about this new fintech app that allows you to send money as airtime to anyone with a tag. Expectedly, she jumped on the train because she always needs airtime since she spends all day talking on the phone.\n\nLike most of us, without reading the terms and conditions or the company\u2019s privacy policy, Ada downloads and installs the app and chooses the tag \u2018adda\u2019. Of course, she immediately sends this to her friends and asks them to download the app so they can send her airtime anytime.\n\nToday, though, Ada has a problem. While trying to send her airtime, her friend mistakenly sent it to a user with a similar but slightly different tag; this user has an underscore (_) at the end of theirs.\n\nAda is distraught and decides she wants to change her tag to something unique but still identifiable by her friends. She goes on the app and tries to change her tag but is told she cannot. Now, she\u2019s angry. Why can\u2019t she change her tag? It\u2019s hers, after all.\n\nThe issues\n\nUnder the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019, a data subject has several rights over the use of their personal data. These include the right to transparent information relating to the processing of data and prior information before data processing.\n\nIt also includes the right to erasure, rectification and restriction of data, and the right to move your data to another platform, among several others.\n\nAda has the right to know extensively how her personal information is being handled and when it is handled. She can also choose to delete, correct, or restrict access to that data. If she wishes to move her personal information on that particular app to another with similar functions, she can do that too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not as cut and dried as this, and this brings me to the idea behind this story.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big idea?\n\nA Twitter thread caught my eye two days ago; it went something like this,\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change your Abeg tag or your name on the Abeg App. You can\u2019t also delete your account on the app.\n\n\u201cThis is in breach of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulations which protects the right of a data subject to rectification and erasure of their personal data.\u201d\n\nYou can't change your Abeg tag or your name on the Abeg App. You can't also delete your account on the app.\n\n\n\nThis is in breach of the Nigerian Data Protection Regulations which protects the right of a data subject to rectification and erasure of their personal data. \u2014 Equivocator (@Oluwanonso_Esq) October 18, 2021\n\nThis Twitter user, a lawyer with the handle, @Oluwanonso_Esq, then proceeded to share a screenshot of the conversation between him and an Abeg Customer Service Agent, L\u00f9, on the startup\u2019s Instagram account.\n\nL\u00f9 told him that he could not change his Abeg tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the conversation between @Oluwanonso_Esq and L\u00f9\n\nTwo questions come to mind. Is this usual with fintechs? Is there truly a problem here?\n\nIs this an isolated incident?\n\nI currently have several fintech apps on my phone. So, I decided to do a little investigation using the ones I could access.\n\nUsing Roqqu, Cowrywise, Risevest, Piggyvest, Accrue, and Barter as case studies, I tried to find answers.\n\nOn Roqqu, I found that I could not change the name associated with my account.\n\nCowrywise allows you to change your name and unique tag.\n\nRisevest and Piggyvest require you to send their support team an email.\n\nBarter does not allow you to change your name, but you can change your handle.\n\nIs there really a problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Iwaria\n\nTo better understand if this was indeed a problem, I spoke with Motunrayo Ope-Ogunseitan, Manager, Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Vetifly, to get a general idea of possible defences in a similar scenario.\n\nShe said there might be different reasons why a company would not allow an individual to change their data on its platform. The first is what she called the \u201cStartup Syndrome.\u201d This means the company is probably not paying attention to complying with the NDPR and is basically trying to get going as soon as possible.\n\nThe other reason she gave was that there might be a legitimate defence to such an action. Why? All laws have exceptions. A good example is the right to freedom of movement as contained in the Nigerian Constitution and the abrogation of that right in a state of emergency or when a crime is committed.\n\n\u201cMy best bet would probably be that such companies would say, \u2018Oh, we cannot allow you to frequently go on the app and delete your personal data or amend it because it may compromise the interests of other people.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut she also said this defence would need to be looked at on a case by case basis as all companies might not be able to rely on the same defence.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the startup app might be philanthropic, to give or provide for people who are in need. So imagine a situation where I get some money, I change my profile details, and I enter another giveaway and keep amassing a lot of money when the money is actually supposed to reach as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOr a scenario where someone credits my verified account with a huge sum of money to assist with sharing it and I just delete my account or deactivate and go offline. Given the nature of the app, considering the fact that it\u2019s largely a financial platform, you shouldn\u2019t just allow people to modify their data. There\u2019s a higher standard of care involved.\u201d\n\nBut she advised companies to communicate these decisions to users.\n\nAnother thing she referred to is the golden rule of interpretation in law. This rule states that a law could be interpreted to show the spirit or the intent of the law rather than a literal interpretation.\n\n\u201cIn as much as it provides for these rights, they don\u2019t necessarily tell the companies how to achieve it. The laws don\u2019t say the right to rectification of data by the data subject must be done on the platform by the individual, or it must be achieved immediately.\n\n\u201cAs a platform provider, I can say, \u2018Oh yes, you have a right, but you just can\u2019t do it yourself and randomly.\u2019 And that\u2019s why a lot of companies just say, \u2018You have a right to delete your data, amend your data. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us by email.\u2019 They won\u2019t necessarily allow you to just do it directly on the platform.\u201d\n\nEssentially, while the right still exists, it cannot be exercised haphazardly.\n\nThe NDPR provides for situations that might be regarded as the lawful processing of a data subject\u2019s data. Article 2.2 of the Regulations says at least one of the following must have occurred:\n\nThe Data Subject has given consent to the processing of his or her Personal Data for one or more specific purposes,\n\nprocessing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract,\n\nprocessing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject,\n\nprocessing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person, and\n\nprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in exercise of official public mandate vested in the controller.\n\nLike we explained here, a data controller is any person, organisation, or body that receives and controls an individual\u2019s data. The data controller determines the purpose and means of data processing.\n\nCombining Ope-Ogunseitan\u2019s words and the provisions of the NDPR, if the company provides a way to ensure the right is exercised or falls under the exceptions listed in Article 2.2, the data subject\u2019s rights have not been tampered with.\n\nUsing Ada\u2019s scenario, if the startup has an option to contact the company\u2019s support person for help to rectify her tag, then her rights as a data subject are still being protected.\n\nOr you could think of it this way. Facebook only allows you to change your name once every 90 days. While you still have the right to rectify your data, it just takes longer.\n\nMuch ado about nothing?\n\nYesterday, October 20, 2021, Abeg replied to @Oluwanonso_Esq\u2019s tweet.\n\n\u201cHi Nonso, thank you for stating your concerns, however, it is possible to change your Abeg tag and delete your Abeg account by contacting our support team at hello@abeg.app.\n\n\u201cThese measures were put in place for security reasons for the initial rollout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making some adjustments and all users will be able to deactivate and change their names without having to reach customer service.\u201d\n\nHi Nonso, thank you for stating your concerns however, it is possible to change your Abegtag and delete your abeg account by contacting our support team at hello@abeg.app.\n\n\n\nThese measures were put in place for security reasons for the initial rollout. \u2014 Abeg (@abeg_app) October 20, 2021\n\nThis can also be seen on Abeg\u2019s website in the FAQ section.\n\nSo why did the customer support agent on Instagram tell Nonso he couldn\u2019t change his tag?

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s TalentQL launches AltSchool Africa to train entry level tech talent for free",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian tech talent startup, TalentQL, has today, October 21, 2021, launched AltSchool Africa. The programme is the startup\u2019s latest attempt to create a tech talent pipeline following the launch of Pipeline, it\u2019s mentorship and upskilling program for senior developers.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem has grown, a number of organizations have sprung up to supply tech talent for startups. After an initial focus on building entry-level talent led by the likes of Andela, the demand for senior talent meant that for a while, training entry-level engineers took a backseat.\n\nA knock-on effect of this is that as the senior engineers get more skilled, they are more valuable to startups outside Africa. Without the ability to compete on remuneration with these foreign startups as well as the option of relocating, local startups face a huge struggle to get the right talents for their startups.\n\nThis is the problem that TalentQL is trying to solve with AltSchool Africa. For nine months, participants would receive training in software development after which they undergo a three month internship. At the end, they get a diploma certificate. Currently, the startup is partnering with the Michael and Cecilia Ibru\u2019s University to issue these certificates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat if we give your parents what they want? Certification. And we give you what you need, Skills.\n\nJoin https://t.co/DyyIWHwwdk.@AltSchoolAfrica \u2014 Adewale Yusuf (@AdewaleYusuf_) October 13, 2021\n\nIn an interview with Techpoint Africa, Adewale Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of TalentQL revealed the reason for giving certificates. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them diplomas because a lot of people can be good but cannot apply to certain opportunities because they do not have a certificate. So we\u2019re giving them skills and a certificate.\u201d\n\nParticipants do not need to have a tech background to apply for the program and it is open to everyone above the age of 16. In addition, there are no tuition fees required although participants would have to pay a $20 (\u20a610,000) application fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter submitting an application, a study kit would be sent to the applicant to assist in preparing for the assessment. The idea is to ensure that it is not just smart people who get in but those who are tenacious. There are three learning tracks \u2014 front-end engineering, back-end engineering, and cloud engineering.\n\nThe mode of instruction is entirely online. Furthermore, the startup intends to use the power of community to help students learn better. Through what it calls \u201cCommunity Peering Learning,\u2019 participants in the same location can meet occasionally to learn and exchange ideas.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of self learning. We\u2019re going to do online and then we have something we call community pairing learning. So for example, if you\u2019re from Osun State, we are going to get people from Osun State to meet and learn together a few times every month. We\u2019ve also designed the program in such a way that you can still be a part of it even if you have a job or are a student.\u201d\n\nThe U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the demand for software developers is going to grow by 22% between 2020 and 2030, faster than the 4% average for other careers. This presents both a unique challenge and opportunity for developing tech talents in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlready, startup founders on the continent are facing a fight to keep their employees who are courted by companies in the West. Therefore it is imperative that a steady pipeline is built to fill the gap left by those who leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Andela\u2019s pivot showed, startups are not exactly lining up to recruit entry level talents with there being a preference for senior engineers.\n\nUnlike Andela that kept engineers on their payroll, AltSchool would only be training software engineers so how are these graduates supposed to gain the experience they need to become senior engineers?\n\nRather than charge a fee, the startup would utilise an income sharing agreement (ISA) similar to that used by Lambda school. Consequently, students only get to pay after they get a job.\n\nYusuf reveals that the internships are one way to help them gain experience while they would be supported until they get a job. He expressed hope that participants perform well enough during these internships that they would be offered permanent placements.\n\nOne way to help these talents gain experience could be by exploring partnerships with companies like Enye, a non-profit that connects developers to founders looking to build out their products. This helps the developer gain experience building a product while the founder gets access to certified talents.\n\nAnother benefit of enrolling in AltSchool would be the fact that it provides a structured curriculum. This is particularly important when you consider that the majority of African software engineers are self-taught. While this is admirable, they are often unable to pass tests by international clients, a challenge that TalentQL faced while trying to match senior engineers with international clients.\n\nWhile speaking to Yusuf, you get the feeling that AltSchool Africa is not just another attempt at entrepreneurship for him but a mission. As he says, this is about democratizing access for every African.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "El-Rufai backs National Assembly on declaration of bandits as terrorists",
          "text": "Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai has hailed the motion by the National Assembly urging the federal government to declare bandits operating in the North West and North Central regions of Nigeria as terrorists.\n\nMr El-Rufai said such a declaration would allow the military to go all out against the bandits without fear of recriminations from the international community.\n\nThe governor stated this on Wednesday at the presentation of the Kaduna State Security Incidents Report for the Third Quarter of 2021. The event was held in Sir Kashim Ibrahim House, Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWe in the Kaduna State Government, have always aligned with the declaration of bandits as insurgents and terrorists. We have written letters to the Federal Government since 2017, asking for this declaration because it is the declaration that will allow the Nigerian military to attack and kill these bandits without any major consequences in international law.\n\n\u201cSo, we support the resolution by the National Assembly and we are going to follow up with a letter of support, for the Federal Government to declare these bandits and insurgents as terrorists, so that they will be fair game for our military. This is the view of the Kaduna State Government.\u201d\n\nMr El-Rufai lamented that his state is still recording daily deadly attacks by bandits despite the investment the state government has made in the security agencies in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of profound regret for me that our considerable investments in security are yet to manifest in the defeat or at least the considerable degradation of the criminals that menace our people.\n\n\u201cThe State Government has undertaken capital expenditure to provide facilities that can multiply the capacity of security agencies to deter crime and conduct effective investigations of those that do occur,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe described the third-quarter security report as sobering, saying it shows the situation has not improved despite the government\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cIt is a sobering report, reflecting the real agony of our citizens and communities, their pains and losses, and the fears and anxiety that have created considerable distress,\u201d the governor said in his review of the report..\n\n\u201cThese figures indicate the continuing severity of the security situation. In our view, this compels an obligation to transparency on the part of the managers of security. It acknowledges the pain of our people, reflects precise figures on the nature and pattern of security incidents and provides the public factual information on this unprecedented challenge.\u201d\n\nMr El-Rufai appealed to the federal government to carry out the planned recruitment of 774,000 youth to engage more young people and indirectly improve the security situation in Nigeria.\n\nRead below the speech by the governor on the occasion.\n\nPROTOCOLS\n\n1. Our Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs has just presented its report on security incidents in Kaduna State within the third quarter of 2021. It is a sobering report, reflecting the real agony of our citizens and communities, their pains and losses, and the fears and anxiety that have created considerable distress. The report puts the statistics in context, analyses the pattern of violence and outlines what the Kaduna State Government and the security agencies are doing to contain the situation and relieve the situation in our communities.\n\n2. These figures indicate the continuing severity of the security situation. In our view, this compels an obligation to transparency on the part of the managers of security. It acknowledges the pain of our people, reflects precise figures on the nature and pattern of security incidents and provides the public factual information on this unprecedented challenge.\n\n3. Previous annual and quarterly security reports have placed the Kaduna Central Senatorial District as the most impacted by these incidents. That was the consistent pattern in the Security Incidents Reports for 2020, the first quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2021.\n\n4. However, the report for the third quarter of 2021 indicates that the Kaduna South Senatorial District had the highest casualties in the period. This reflects the toxic mix of banditry and the continuing violent clashes between communities in Zangon-Kataf, Kaura and Kauru LGAs. The locus of these violent incidents is Zangon-Kataf LGA where the peace process, championed so impressively since last year by His Highness the Agwatyap, is being imperilled by sundry acts of lawlessness. I call on all the communities in Zangon Kataf LGA to recommit to peace, to work together to promote harmony, uphold the rule of law and unite to against the criminals that threaten all of them.\n\n5. While receiving the second quarter report in July 2021, I had noted that \u201cit is a matter of profound regret for me that our considerable investments in security are yet to manifest in the defeat or at least the considerable degradation of the criminals that menace our people. We have consistently supported the federal security agencies deployed to our state with logistics and equipment. Apart from these recurrent expenses, the Kaduna State Government has undertaken capital expenditure to provide facilities that can multiply the capacity of security agencies to deter crime and conduct effective investigations of those that do occur. We created the Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs to provide a specialised institution to coordinate these investments and our liaison with the federal security agencies\u201d.\n\n6. I am happy to report that since I made those comments, the military and other security agencies have commenced operations against the bandits. These operations, which began in the third quarter, are degrading bandits but they are not yet simultaneous across all the affected states in the North-West region. This reflects the limitations that personnel and other resource deficits have imposed on the federal security agencies. There are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\n7. Many state governments in the North-West and the North-Central have adopted an unconventional approach to help the federal security agencies to better protect our communities. There is no alternative to launching simultaneous operations.\n\n8. I call for a consensus between the Federal Government and the the 36 states on an emergency programme of recruitment into the security agencies. Government can change the game significantly by hiring 1,000 willing youths from each of the 774 LGAs in the country into the security agencies. This will be a surge in numbers that is unprecedented since the civil war. An influx of 774,000 new boots on the ground will be a significant blow against criminals and an employment boost.\n\n9. I wish to appeal to all the citizens and residents of Kaduna State to remain law abiding and to uphold peace in their communities as best as they can. On behalf of the state government, I offer our sympathy for all the pains and sorrow insecurity is causing despite our sincere and consistent efforts and investments of hard-earned resources. I assure you that we are working hard to solve this problem and it is our solemn duty to do so. We offer our condolences to the security agencies and the families of the security officers that have been killed while trying to keep our people safe.\n\n10. On a final note, I will like to thank the honorable Member for Zangon/Jaba for commending the conduct of the Local Government elections. I want to thank all the security agencies for the role that they played in making this happen. I will also like to announce that this Saturday, the two Local Governments of Birnin Gwari and Zangon Kataf will be having their own Local Government elections. They were postponed for security reasons, but I believe that the security agencies and the State Independent Electoral Commission have agreed that it is possible to hold this election this weekend. Our hope is that we will be able to conduct this election as well as bye elections in two or three Local Governments, so that we swear in the new Local Government Chairmen, to start their tenure from the 1st of November 2021.\n\n11. I would like to observe that if elections do not take place as scheduled on this date, we will have no option than to appoint Administrators to manage these Local Governments for the next three years. So it is in the interest of everybody to allow elections to take place, otherwise I will appoint people to manage those local governments.\n\n12. I will also want to comment on those that are affected by insecurity. We have a Riot Damage and Compensation Fund for those who are affected from 2016. I am therefore directing the Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs to draw from the Riot Damage Fund, to pay all those affected, up to, and including this year.\n\n13. I would also like to inform the security agencies as well as the traditional leaders here, that we are in the process of establishing a Farmers/Herdsmen Reconciliation Council at the State level as well as similar Committees at the Local Government and Chiefdom and Emirate levels. This is backed by a law, a military edict, enacted in the 1990s. But somehow, we didn\u2019t come across the law until recently. So, we are activating these Committees to help in managing clashes between farmers and herdsmen at all levels.\n\n14. We in the Kaduna State Government, have always aligned with the declaration of bandits as insurgents and terrorists. We have written letters to the Federal Government since 2017, asking for this declaration because it is the declaration that will allow the Nigerian military to attack and kill these bandits without any major consequences in international law. So, we support the resolution by the National Assembly and we are going to follow up with a letter of support, for the Federal Government to declare these bandits and insurgents as terrorists, so that they will be fair game for our military. This is the view of the Kaduna State Government.\n\n15. Let me conclude by expressing our deepest gratitude once again to our traditional leaders. You are playing a very important role not only in the provision of useful intelligence in your communities, but in also in engaging in reconciliation. You are also engaged in peace-building in collaboration with our state Peace Commission. We urge you to continue and I particularly urge the Agwatyap not to be discouraged by what is happening, to continue to work towards peace. In the end, there is no alternative to peace building. As leaders, we cannot but to continue to preach peace.\n\n16. I want to express our gratitude to our security agencies for the sacrifice that they are making. I urge them not to be discouraged by comments by those who are uninformed, who think that nothing is being done. My colleagues, the politicians, are the most guilty; just because they want people to clap for them, they will say that nothing is being done. If nothing is being done, you will not be able to sleep. Many of these incidences are being prevented and when they are, you will not hear about it. You don\u2019t hear commendation but when something happens, you hear all the condemnation. As someone who receives the security reports on a daily basis, I know that a lot is being done by the security agencies. I wish to commend you and may God bless you. We are happy with the results of the military campaigns, and it is clear that kidnapping has gone down, but we want more than that. We want to have zero-kidnappings, zero killings.\n\nThank you for listening.",

          "text": "South Africa based Mondia Digital, a consolidation of the Mondia Group\u2019s digital content distribution business, an end-to-end, product-centric and data-driven company with a focus on opportunities in the B2B segment, and its digital payments company, Mondia Pay, say they are proud to have contributed their expertise and innovative payment, content and B2B platforms to Vodacom\u2019s VodaPay \u201cSuper App\u201d, which launched in South Africa in August 2021.\n\nThe VodaPay Super App, designed in collaboration with Alibaba Group-owned fintech services platform Alipay, allows consumers to do everything from paying bills to sending money, playing games and ordering takeaways, a statement from the firm said\n\nAccording to it, the VodaPay Super App offers consumers a single point of entry and payment platform, with no additional download required.\n\nMondia Digital has integrated all of its technology, content and services into the easy-to-use VodaPay Super App environment. It is also responsible for connecting third-party content providers into this ecosystem.\n\nMondia Digital will make a selection of its custom content platforms available through the Super App, including: Mum and Baby \u2013 a free-of-charge mobile health intervention that provides maternal, neonatal and child health information designed to encourage good health practices; Vodacom\u2019s vLive app \u2013 a lifestyle and entertainment mini-ecosystem within the Super App that uses gamified elements to manage subscriptions to Mondia\u2019s 123 Kaboodle kids content service; Playinc., a comprehensive gaming portal; and My Muze, a 360o music portal.\n\nMondia Digital has also co-created many of Vodacom\u2019s key branded services on the Super App platform.\n\nIn addition to content integration, Mondia Pay has rolled out the provision of its seamless, contactless Direct Carrier Billing (DCB) payment service to the VodaPay Super App. DCB allows customers to make payments conveniently and securely by charging them to their mobile phone bill. Mondia Pay\u2019s DCB service is used by tens of millions of customers across the Middle East and Africa, and provides a highly scalable payment gateway that both customers and merchants can trust.\n\nDCB is seamless, with no need to sign up for any additional accounts or fill out any forms. Payments are completed in a matter of seconds and provide the best checkout experience on mobile devices, where filling out forms is time consuming and cumbersome. Making payments with DCB is secure. No personal data is transmitted during the payment process so there is no need to worry about identity theft.\n\nPaolo Rizzardini, CEO of Mondia Digital, said, \u201cWe are committed to the continuing digitalisation of Africa, and the VodaPay Super App B2B ecosystem is an exciting opportunity in this regard. The future of digital content consumption is going to be driven by innovative partnerships that offer compelling and convenient consumer solutions. Our growth across Africa has been driven by our ability to create consumer-centric products with outstanding digital content, and secure long-term, fruitful partnerships with some of the most innovative and dynamic companies on the continent. Our enduring relationship with Vodacom continues to deliver value for consumers and a growing ecosystem of third-party businesses alike.\u201d\n\nSimon Rahmann, CEO of Mondia Pay, said, \u201cThe VodaPay Super App is an exciting environment in which to implement our DCB platform. All-in-one environments offering seamless access and seamless payment are the future of customer and business ecosystems. By offering consumers a simple, fast and secure way to pay for services using their mobile phone, we not only encourage financial inclusion, but we make it easier for local and global developers to offer their services to millions more people.\u201d\n\nVodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub said, \u201cOur partnership with Mondia Digital and Mondia Pay strengthens our access to world-class technology and expertise, and leverages their experience across the MEA regions in developing strong, valuable partnerships and delivering seamless payment and content platforms. We want to drive financial inclusion, enhance the business-to-business ecosystem and transform the fintech environment in South Africa, by offering the capabilities of the VodaPay mini programs to as many businesses, of all sizes, across multiple industries as possible.\u201d\n\nWhile the Super App will be accessible to customers on any mobile network, it will be zero-rated for Vodacom users. The VodaPay Super App is set to be rolled out in other international Vodacom markets.\n\nDevelopers and businesses are invited to join the VodaPay ecosystem by building their own \u201cmini programs\u201d \u2013 third-party, downloadable sub-applications run within the super app.\n\nSome 70 businesses have already signed up or have committed to building their own mini programs in the app, including Big Blue, FlightSite, Dollar, Thrifty, West Pack, Petzone, NetFlorist, Kitkat Cash & Carry, Droppa, Planet54, Jacaranda FM, KFC, and Booking.com.\n\nMini programs can accept both physical and online payments from customers with the in-app VodaPay digital wallet. Customers can choose to pay upfront, with rewards, or with payment terms such as buy-now-pay-later and nano-credit offerings.",

          "text": "Amnesty International, CNN, and DJ Switch have all been asked to apologize by the Buhari administration for allegedly misled the public about a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nDJ Switch whose given name is Obianuju Udeh is a Nigerian disc jockey who is on exile over the 2020 EndSARS protest and the Lekki toll gate incidence.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the trio should tender an unreserved apology for portraying the Nigerian military, police and other security agencies in a bad light.\n\nAddressing newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja on the first anniversary of the Lekki toll gate incidence, the minister reiterated that contrary to the claims by CNN, Amnesty International and the disc jockey, the military did not shoot at protesters.\n\n\u201cCNN acted unprofessionally by relying on unverified, and possibly-doctored social media videos, as well as other open-source information to conclude that a massacre took place at the toll gate.\n\n\u201cOn its part, CNN went from 38 people killed to two to just one, after a supposed global exclusive even when the network had no reporter on ground at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that was set up by the Lagos State Government after the EndSARS protest wrapped up its sitting.\n\n\u201cDuring the sitting, CNN was summoned but it never showed up, thus missing a great opportunity to prove its allegation of a massacre at the toll gate.\n\n\u201cIn its latest attempt to grasp at straws and redeem whatever is left of its battered credibility on this issue, CNN has continued with its baseless report that soldiers shot at protesters,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said Amnesty International also had a golden opportunity to convince the world, but it rather opted for issuing \u201cmeaningless press releases.\u201d\n\nMr Mohammed condemned a current report running on the CNN network on the purported massacre contending that the international news platform acted unprofessionally.\n\n\u201cCNN brazenly and unashamedly held on to its flawed narrative, relying on an unidentified mother whose son was reportedly shot dead at Lekki, but without convincing evidence of who shot him dead.\n\n\u201cThe same CNN that tweeted on October 23, 2020, that 38 people were shot dead at Lekki is now struggling to convince the world that one boy was killed at Lekki. What a shame,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said the federal government remained proud of the security agencies for acting professionally and showing restraint all through the EndSARS protests and the ensuing violence.\n\nThe minister said it was the professionalism and restraint of the security agencies that saved the lives and property of many.\n\n\u201cThe six soldiers and 37 policemen who died during the EndSARS protests are human beings with families even though the Human Rights organisations and CNN simply ignored their deaths, choosing instead to trumpet a phantom massacre,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Buhari regime has laboured much to deny culpability in the shooting of unarmed protesters by the Nigerian military on the night of October 20, 2020. After initially denying soldiers\u2019 presence at the scene, the government later admitted that security agents fired at protesters but maintained that only blank ammunition were fired.\n\nMr Mohammed had continually claimed there were no casualties on the night despite reports of casualties by Peoples Gazette and other media organisations and witnesses.",

          "text": "Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Federal Government will in a matter of weeks, take steps to regulate road transportation and mass transit vehicles operations in the country, Senator Gbemisola Saraki , Minister of State Transportation has disclosed.\n\nSen Saraki who made the disclosure in a meeting with a section of automotive manufacturers led by Ifeanyichukwu Agwu, the Chief Executive Officer of BKG Exhibitions Limited, and Chairman Organizing Committee of Abuja International Motor Fair, said the decision became necessary in order to reposition Nigeria\u2019s road transportation system ahead of African Continental Free Trade Area\n\nACFTA.\n\nThe Minister of State lamented that of 76000 trucks registered at the Port only 17 supposedly meet the standard, stressing that Lom\u00e9 and Cotonou are complaining that Nigerian vehicles are below standard.\n\nSaraki, however disclosed that arrangements are being put in place for the Federal Government to brainstorm with players in the automotive industry, including assemblers and manufacturers to find a local solution that would move the industry forward.\n\nAccording to the Minister of State, over 97% of passengers movements in Nigeria are done on the road, hence government needs to ensure proper restructuring for better service delivery.\n\n\u201cThis afternoon I was in a meeting that the Vice President Chaired and we are looking at how best to tackle the issue of road transportation.\n\n\u201cI am sure you will agree with me that right now, it is unregulated, anybody can put vehicle on the road and call himself a transporter and they are going. Funds are not coming, taxes are not paid, there is no consumer satisfaction, there is no feedback, it\u2019s completely disoriented right now. And with the fact that ACFTA is coming soon, in order for us to compete properly, we need to have a regulated road transportation system for commercial operators, which now comes to the manufacturers. With the ACFTA coming, this morning it came out that we have a lot substandard vehicles on the roads. I know that Lome and Cotonou have complained that the vehicles in Nigeria are below standard. Of the 76000 trucks registered supposedly only 17 meet the standard.\n\nEarlier, Agwu reeled the problems bedeviling the sector describing the nation\u2019s auto industry as an orphan that is being over used even though it accounts for 15% of those working in the country.\n\nThe BKG boss lamented that the auto sector is under heavy stress which affects Nigerians in terms of cost of transportation, lack of safety in movement of good and services due to bad vehicles.\n\nAccording to Agwu, policy inconsistency is one problem that have cost the auto sector a whole lot of money.\n\n\u201cCompanies set up factories to assemble with billions of Naira and the next thing you see is they change the policy and said you can bring in whatever you want. Where does that work? And that is why serious companies actually do not come to Nigeria.\u201d.\n\nHe further decried the skyrocketing exchange rate of the Naira to the dollar, stressing that the amount of money used in buying a car in Nigeria currently was what used to build a house all because of the exchange rate.\n\n\u201cA full Option Toyota Corolla that was a little above N3 million is currently 18 million.

If you look at it, it is a very heavy mandate. We have about 3.1million out of school children with disabilities that do not want to go to school. This requires our collective efforts to actualise this.\u201d\n\nThe NCPWD boss assured that, the curriculum when developed, would go through the appropriate authorities for proper implementation.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to share story, we are not here to share experience, but we are here to gather all the experiences we have over time, put them on paper so that we can develop curriculum and forward to the regulatory bodies,\u201d said Lalu.\n\nThe ES said about six Vice Chancellors of the Federal Universities have shown interest and passion for inclusion of PWDs in their institutions, adding that the developed curriculum will reflect in both the Nigerian colleges of education, polytechnics, and universities.\n\nHe disclosed the Commission\u2019s resolve to offer special scholarships for Persons with Disabilities in schools, adding that the scholarship will not start from Tertiary institutions but, right from the primary, secondary and to the Tertiary.\n\nWhile speaking on the effort made so far, Lalu said NCPWD is working with the Education Ministry to ensure that every federal school is open for free education for PWDs.\n\nThe Commission, according to him, has secured perfect partnership with the Nigerian Police Force to enforce the right to education of people with disabilities.\n\nHe said the commission will soon launch digital application that will help PWDs to widen their capacity.\n\nLalu, therefore, called on the relevant authorities to partner with the commission to actualise it\u2019s objectives.\n\nAlso, the National President, Association of the blind, Ishika Adamu said the curriculum will help close the gap in accessing Tertiary education for PWDs.",

She says she then felt a wetness around her legs, after which he asked her to clean herself while he also cleaned himself with a handkerchief.\n\nShe added that, the next day, he came around to their house again, and asked her to follow him to his car to bring the fruits he bought, and as she bent to pick them, he inserted his car-key in her backside.\n\nThe minor was seen in the video being given two male and female dummies to demonstrate the alleged acts, which she did.\n\nShe was questioned on the truth of the child\u2019s statements during cross examination by the two lead defense lawyers, Babatunde Ogala and Dada Awoshika, both Senior Advocates of Nigeria.\n\nBut, Mrs Kayode-Ajayi maintained that though the victim was seven years old at the time, her brain cells were well developed to recall events in full and that she had explained during the pre-interview session on the need for her to tell the truth. She added, \u201cI asked her open ended questions and she gave Episodic memory recalls.\u201d\n\nThe witness also debunked Mr Ogala\u2019s position that the alleged victim was neglected by her foster mother, the comedienne, Damilola Adekoya, popularly called, Princess.\n\nIn her words, \u201c90 percent of abusers are family members or other persons with easy access to the child, they could even be caregivers like drivers, teachers, domestic staff or religious leaders.\u201d\n\nThe witness was also accused of basing her findings after the interview on opinion and hearsay, which she denied.\n\nMr Awoshika (SAN) said the interviewing guidelines which the expert said she relied on when she met with the child weren\u2019t protocols recognised under Nigerian laws. But, she said the procedures have since been adopted in several countries.\n\nThe defense counsel also asked her about her academic qualifications as a certified specialist, to which she affirmed that though she wasn\u2019t a qualified child psychologist, she had undergone the necessary trainings on child forensic education, in addition to being a qualified lawyer.\n\nFurther hearing continues on Thursday.",

It is designed to put 1.5-tonne payloads into orbit 600km to 800km (373 miles-497 miles) above the Earth and has been 10 years in development at a cost of 2 trillion won ($1.6bn).\n\nSouth Korea has risen to become the world\u2019s 12th-largest economy and a technologically advanced nation but has lagged in the headline-making world of spaceflight, where the Soviet Union led the way with the first satellite launch in 1957, closely followed by the United States.\n\nChina, Japan and India all have advanced space programmes, and the South\u2019s nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea put a 300-kg (660-pound) satellite into orbit in 2012 in what Western countries condemned as a disguised missile test.\n\nOverseen by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), NURI rocket was moved to its launch pad on Wednesday and raised into position.\n\n\u201cAll preparations like umbilical connection and confidential inspection have been done,\u201d the Ministry of Science and Technology said in a statement.\n\nSpace launches have long been a sensitive issue on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea faces sanctions over its nuclear-armed ballistic missile programme.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s future plans call for launching surveillance, navigation, and landing a lunar probe by 2030. The programme also includes military satellites, but officials deny that the NURI has any use as a weapon itself.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest initial advantages potentially with this launch system is that it will provide South Korea the ability to put satellites into space that provide capability to have a system of surveillance over North Korea \u2013 and this will give south Korea the ability to monitor potential North Korea launches of ballistic and cruise missiles,\u201d Jon Grevatt, a defence industry analyst with Janes, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIn the next few years, South Korea plans to develop and start operating a series of space launch vehicles from the NARO Space Centre, and these launch vehicles will be putting small vehicles into lower orbit, further increasing South Korea\u2019s space defence capabilities,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan and this is the first stage.\u201d\n\nSeoul\u2019s space programme has a chequered record \u2013 its first two launches in 2009 and 2010, which in part used Russian technology, both ended in failure, the second one exploding two minutes into the flight.\n\nThe first successful launch was in 2013 and came after multiple delays and several failed tests. That rocket was also jointly developed with Russia.\n\nHaving its own launch vehicle will give South Korea the flexibility to determine payload types and launch schedules, as well as protect \u201cconfidential\u201d payloads such as spy satellites, officials told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\u201cRockets are the only means available to mankind to go out into space,\u201d Lee Sang-ryul, the director of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, told South Korean newspaper Chosun Biz.\n\n\u201cHaving such technology means we have fulfilled basic requirements to join this space exploration competition.\u201d",

He realised he had to come to the US to get something different.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018Listen, I know people don\u2019t think I\u2019m a dog. I\u2019ve got to be a dog in this next fight\u2019. And that\u2019s his words. He told me, \u2018I just need you to show me how to be the best dog you can teach me to be\u2019.\u201d\n\nShields has worked with a slew of heavyweight champions including Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield.\n\nJermall Charlo works under Shields and posted several videos on his Instagram of Joshua speaking with his coach and doing some light training.\n\nJoshua has not made a final decision on his coaching staff, which also includes assistant trainers Angel Hernandez and Joby Clayton.\n\nAfter his defeat by Ruiz Jr, Joshua added Hernandez to his team and the 32-year-old could yet stay with McCracken as his head coach.\n\nA switch to the US would see Joshua have to move his training headquarters away from Sheffield where he has spent his entire professional and amateur career.\n\nMcCracken has trained Joshua since his amateur days, but was heavily criticised for the gameplan against Usyk.\n\nJoshua was completely outclassed by Usyk and convincingly beaten after deciding to try and outbox the former undisputed cruiserweight champion.",

          "title": "Why Separatists in Cameroon and Nigeria Have United: BBC",
          "text": "A man walks in a burnt out restaurant in 2019 that was destroyed in fighting between armed Anglophone separatists and the Cameroonian military.\n\nCameroon\u2019s five-year conflict could be taking a significant new turn with reports that its English-speaking separatist groups are getting help from an armed group in neighbouring Nigeria.\n\nAfter two attacks by Anglophone militants which cost the lives of 15 Cameroonian soldiers last month, the army issued a statement declaring that \u201cthe separatists have used heavy weapons for the first time, in violation of international humanitarian law\u201d.\n\nIt went on to add that \u201cthe rise in power of these terrorist groups\u2026 is largely due to their co-operation with other terrorist entities operating outside the country\u201d.\n\nContacted by the BBC, Cameroonian defence forces spokesperson Col Cyrille Atonfack Nguemo did not specify which foreign groups were allegedly working with the Anglophone separatists, who say they face discrimination in the country dominated by French-speakers.\n\nIt is therefore unclear whether the military believes it is one or several armed groups, and also where they are located.\n\nBut the separatist Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF) has confirmed an alliance with the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), an ethnic Igbo group waging a sometimes violent campaign for autonomy in south-eastern Nigeria, some of which lies just 150km (90 miles) from the border with Cameroon\u2019s English-speaking regions.\n\nA woman walks into Nigeria from Cameroon at a checkpoint in Mfum, in Nigeria\u2019s Cross Rivers State, in 2018.\n\nA video posted on the ADF Facebook page earlier this year shows Cho Ayaba, the leader of the Ambazonia Governing Council \u2013 one of the two main English-speaking separatist groups, and Ipob leader Nnamdi Kanu announcing a \u201cstrategic and military\u201d alliance.\n\nBoth separatist leaders explained that the two groups would \u201cwork to secure their common border and ensure an open exchange of arms, intelligence and personnel\u201d.\n\nAnalysts are divided. \u201cFor the moment, the contribution of this alliance on the ground in the Anglophone zone is not yet clear,\u201d says Elvis Arrey, senior analyst for Cameroon at the research group International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nHowever, Raoul Sumo Tayo, a historian and security analyst in the region, says it should not be downplayed, as it offers both groups rear bases where they can retreat, beyond the reach of their respective countries\u2019 armed forces.\n\nThis is especially significant in Cameroon, where he said the \u201carmy was practically absent [from the areas hit by conflict] before the insurgency and therefore has extremely limited knowledge of the area\u201d.\n\nThe two countries have previously discussed giving each other\u2019s security forces the right to cross the border, especially when chasing members of the Boko Haram Islamist militant group further north, but a deal was never reached.\n\nThe Cameroon authorities have not gone into much detail about what kind of weapons they say are being used, beyond briefly referring to anti-tank missiles and rocket launchers.\n\nSome actually come from attacks on the defence and security forces, says the ICG\u2019s Mr Arrey.\n\n\u201cOther weapons come from Nigeria,\u201d he adds.\n\nAccording to Mr Tayo, even \u201cbefore the crisis in the Anglophone regions, the Niger Delta area was an important hub for arms trafficking in the sub-region\u201d.\n\nWeapons bound for the Anglophone region of Cameroon have often been seized by the Nigerian authorities.\n\nOver the past three years, scores of people have been arrested on charges of trafficking arms to Cameroon.\n\nMr Tayo believes that some weapons are likely to come from \u201ccountries with a large Anglophone diaspora\u201d. Some Cameroonians from English-speaking regions have been charged in the US with alleged arms trafficking, although none has yet been convicted.\n\nWhile Ipob has this year been accused of ransacking police stations and stealing weapons, which could potentially be smuggled across the border.\n\nEven before the latest unrest in the two countries, the border areas were poorly controlled on both sides.\n\nIt is partly made up of the Niger Delta, a huge forested area full of creeks and inlets and multiple clandestine ports, which borders both English-speaking Cameroon and the Igbo heartland, where most Ipob attacks are concentrated.\n\nThere are ethnic and cultural ties between some groups found on either side of the border, which could further smooth links.\n\nThe government in Yaound\u00e9 seems to be concerned about the situation and has announced a strategic change in its military intervention in the area, without giving details.\n\nAt the end of August, the two countries agreed to step up security along their 2,000km (1,240 mile)-long border, which is threatened by the separatists, as well as by Boko Haram.\n\nThe two countries also co-operated when Cameroonian separatist leader Julius Sisiku Tabe and eight others were arrested in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, in 2017.\n\nThey were sent back to Cameroon where they were given life sentences for terrorism and other crimes, which they are challenging.\n\nBoth Nigeria\u2019s Igbo community and English-speaking Cameroonians have long complained of discrimination by their respective governments.\n\nThe Igbos declared the independence of Biafra from Nigeria in 1967, sparking a war that ended in 1970 following the death of an estimated one million people.\n\nAlthough the federal army won, Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s Ipob is the latest group to take up the Igbo cause. He was arrested in June and is currently in detention on charges of treason, which he denies.\n\nScores of people have been killed in unrest over the past year.\n\nIn Cameroon, protests by English-speaking lawyers and teachers in 2016 over laws they saw as favouring the French language escalated into a full-blown separatist conflict, with some groups declaring the independence of what they call Ambazonia the following year.\n\nAmid reports of atrocities on both sides, the conflict has caused thousands of deaths and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes \u2013 many have crossed over into Nigeria.\n\nOn 1 January 1960, the French colony of Cameroun gained independence and became Cameroon.\n\nThe UK also controlled the former German colony of Cameroon. At independence, its citizens were given a choice of joining either Nigeria or Cameroon.\n\nSouthern Cameroonians opted to unite with Cameroon, while Northern Cameroon joined Nigeria.",

          "text": "The Covid pandemic will \u201cgo on for a year longer than it needs to\u201d because poorer countries are not getting the vaccines they need, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\n\nDr Bruce Aylward, senior leader at the WHO, said it meant the Covid crisis could \u201ceasily drag on deep into 2022\u201d.\n\nLess than 5% of Africa\u2019s population have been vaccinated, compared to 40% on most other continents.\n\nThe UK has delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need.\n\nIt has pledged a total of 100 million.\n\nThe original idea behind Covax was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally.\n\nThe group of charities, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly.\n\nOfficial figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses.\n\nDr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines in order that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead.\n\nHe said wealthy countries needed to \u201cstocktake\u201d where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer.\n\n\u201cI can tell you we\u2019re not on track\u201d he said. \u201cWe really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Vaccine \u2013 an alliance of charities \u2013 has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries.\n\nOxfam\u2019s Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements.\n\n\u201cThey should not have been acquiring these doses from Covax,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing better than double-dipping and means that poorer countries which are already at the back of the queue, will end up waiting longer.\u201d\n\nThe UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had \u201ckick-started\u201d Covax last year with a donation of \u00a3548m.\n\nThe Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now ceased to use Covax vaccines.\n\nThe country\u2019s International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: \u201cAs soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries.\u201d\n\nCovax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.",
