He further claimed that he was headbutted by one of the officers, leaving him with a bloodied mouth.\n\n\u201cI struggled to call my colleagues at the scene but one officer exclaimed \u2018I will shoot you if you move closer\u2019. Eventually, an older officer at the scene talked to them and they freed me. I showed them my identity card but the officers who battered me, scorned it, saying, \u2018Can you try this with operatives of DSS, even soldiers? The Command should have let us sign for guns and kill and arrest these protesters. In Ondo Command, they would have signed guns for us to deal with these miscreants who want to pull us into politics.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnother officer screamed and said: \u2018You came here claiming you are a journalist.

People are suffering in this country.\n\n\u201cThey (NNPC) should import more so that the product will be available everywhere.\u201d\n\nIPMAN Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi, opened up that maketers were not loading PMS from private depot because there was no profit.\n\nNoting that it was partly the cause of the current fuel scarcity, he charged the NNPC and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) to compel the private depots to sell the fuel at the official rate.\n\nOn contaminated petrol, Maigandi revealed that his members have been directed to take an inventory of the toxic fuel.\n\nAccording to him, the members are complying with the instructions that they should not sell it. This, he said, has led to the decline in the news about the harm of the toxic petrol.\n\nHis words: \u201cPeople have to buy this product as much as N165/litre and when they do they sell it at N162 to N165 per litre. So, marketers don\u2019t buy it because there is no profit.\n\n\u201cThat one too, is contributing to the scarcity and that is why some of the filling stations are not buying nor selling.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC and the regulatory agencies should intervene so that the depots sell at the government stipulated rates. This will allow the marketers to load and sell.\n\nContaminated petrol : \u201cwe even asked our members to go round and take the inventory. We have told them that nobody should sell that contaminated fuel no matter what. The members are really complying.\n\nThat is why you have not been hearing any issue of anything contaminated. All that you hear is just the queue.\u201d",

          "text": "Osun govt urges President to caution minister\n\nStudents protest at NSCDC office\n\nThe police yesterday blamed the Minister of Interior, Chief Rauf Aregbesola, for the recent mayhem in Osogbo, the state capital.\n\nAlso, the Osun State Government condemned the shooting, warning that any unruly action by any individual, no matter highly placed, will be checked legally.\n\nA statement by Police spokesman SP Yemisi Opalola explained that Aregbesola\u2019s conduct breached public peace.\n\nShe said: \u201cYesterday\u2019s action was conduct likely to cause a breach of the public peace. About 5:30pm, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola was moving in a convoy of personnel of NSCDC, Correctional Service, Immigration, as well as some unidentified armed people, suspected to be political thugs, on Orisumbare/MDS road, Osogbo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cSuddenly, some of the security escorts of the minister started shooting sporadically into the air without any provocation or attack, thereby causing members of the public to scamper for safety.\n\n\u201cThirteen empty shells of G-3, assault, and AK-47 rifles were recovered on the road after the minister\u2019s departure. No casualty was recorded. The situation is under close monitoring.\u201d\n\nHowever, the spokesperson of NSCDC, Atanda Olabisi, in a statement, attributed the mayhem to \u201cunknown hoodlums.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Osun State Commandant NSCDC, Emmanuel Ocheja, has assured residents of the state of adequate security, amid the mayhem caused by some unscrupulous elements in the state capital today.\n\n\u201cUnknown hoodlums attacked the convoy of the former Governor of Osun State and Minister of Interior Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola about 6:40pm around Old Garage Area in Osogbo, the state capital. However, the security detail of the minister were able to disperse the hoodlums and bring normalcy to the area.\u201d\n\nThe Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) advised the camps of Aregbesola and Governor Adegboyega Oyetola to embrace peace in the interest of the state.\n\nThe council regretted that the clash between the opposing camps is capable of plunging the state into anarchy.\n\nIPAC Chairman Wale Adebayo said in a statement that the crisis is capable of painting the state in bad light.\n\nUrging the major actors in the Monday shooting to call their men to order, Adebayo urged the two respected leaders to embrace peace.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is obvious that democracy can only thrive in a peaceful atmosphere. It is our only hope of building a strong, virile, stable, prosperous and a just society\u201d.\n\nThe state government maintained that the roadshow by Aregbesola was organised to truncate the peace of the state.\n\nSpecial Adviser to Oyetola on Political Matters Sunday Akere speaking during the endorsement by APC members in Ila Federal Constituency, said: \u201cThere is no truth in the claim that Aregbesola wanted to be assassinated. What they are trying to do is to cause crisis in the state, probably for them to get sympathy and to make the Federal Government declare a state of emergency.\n\n\u201cAregbesola came to town to terrorise residents of the state. It is the game plan of Aregbesola which we all know. We know his orientation, thinking and plans in the state. We can\u2019t be surprised by his actions. What he is trying to do is to intimidate voters ahead of the primary election of APC in Osun.\n\n\u201cWe want the Presidency to call him to order. Aregbesola is no more representing the interest of Osun, but his own interest. Most of his aides as a minister are not from Osun State. He will never succeed with his personal agendas in Osun State.\n\nAkere also denied the claim that some people planned to assassinate the minister, saying it was unfounded.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA party elders, Prince Felix Awofisayo, advised Aregbesola to stop fomenting crisis.\n\nHe said in a statement that the shooting was uncalled for and should be condemned by all peace-loving people.\n\nHe said: \u201cI do not know what Ogbeni Aregbesola stands to gain if anyone among traders by the roadside is hit by stray bullets from guns held by his security details, or hoodlums in his entourage.\n\n\u201cI admonish the nation\u2019s minister of Interior to call all the security personnel and hoodlums in his entourage to order and allow residents of the state to enjoy the current peace pervading the state.\n\n\u201cWhen the minister was at the helm of affairs in the state, no one could do what he did on Monday without repercussion.\n\n\u201cMy candid advice to Governor Oyetola is to remain focused and not be distracted by the shenanigans of those opposing his style of administration and by extension, enemies of development.\u201d\n\nProtesters under the aegis of National Association of Osun State Students (NAOSS) and National Association of Nigeria Students/Joint Campus Committee, (Osun axis) stormed the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun State to protest the shooting.\n\nThe protesters described sporadic gunshots as unacceptable and disturbing.\n\nThey arrived at the entrance of the command on Oke-Ayepe, Osogbo, at 2:30pm, carrying placards with inscriptions: \u201cNSCDC threatens our people in Osun\u201d, \u201cNSCDC, are we safe\u201d, \u201cNSCDC, \u201cwe are having you for peace not to kill our people\u201d, \u201c Stop brutality against Osun residents,\u201d and many more.\n\nThe protesters submitted a letter of protest addressed to the Commander General of the Civil Defence Corps, Dr Hammed Abubkar, signed by NAOSS President, Agboola Yusuf, State Coordinator of Progressive Youth Alternative, Sanusi Wasiu and Osun NANS/JCC Chairman, Oyelayo Azeez.\n\nThe Nation Osun Correspondent, Toba Adedeji, was brutalised by officers of NSCDC on the scene of the protest.\n\nThey also threatened to shoot other reporters on the scene of the protest.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the governor Ismail Omipidan said Aregbesola is not God and therefore, cannot determine the fate of his principal, Oyetola.\n\nHe told reporters in Ila: \u201cFrom 2011 when Governor Oyetola was appointed chief of staff to Aregbesola in 2018, against all odds, he emerged, first as the candidate of APC, and later, governor of the state, at a time when many thought it was all over for him, it was obvious that he was on a divine political course.\n\n\u201cMy principal has absolute faith in God and the people of Osun. In these last three years plus, the people can tell the difference in terms of responsible and responsive governance and politics.\n\n\u201cBefore we came in, Osun West was literally neglected in terms of infrastructure. But since we came in, we have done roads that had been abandoned for close to 20 years in that district. This, perhaps, explains why leaders and critical stakeholders from the area are already appealing to themselves to allow Oyetola take another shot at the governorship for the second term.\n\n\u201cJust about a week ago, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, urged the people of the town to vote for Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\n\u201cOluwo, who advised his subjects not to waste their resources and energy working against the re-election bid of the governor, said only those who are not interested in the growth and development of the town and Osun State would want to run against Oyetola.\n\n\u201cThe royal father said by the special Grace of God and the support of the people, Oyetola will be re-elected to consolidate the achievements he has so far recorded. Now, Aregbesola\u2019s anointed candidate is from Iwo. So you be the judge.\n\n\u201cAs the 2022 contest draws closer, like the saying goes, there is no point comparing the sun with the moon, both shine when it is their time. For now, it\u2019s Oyetola\u2019s sun that is shining by the permission and Grace of God and the power of the people of Osun. And as the majority are already saying, this sun will shine beyond 2022.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is God and Osun people that will determine Oyetola\u2019s fate, not an individual trying to play God.\u201d",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has disclosed how the team headed by the detained Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, was contacted by the drug cartel from Addis Ababa in a deal involving the 25 kg cocaine.\n\nThe anti-drug agency has said it has no reason to shield anyone who may be indicated in the course of the ongoing investigation of the drug scandal.\n\nIn a statement by its Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, the NDLEA said it remains committed to an evidence-based investigation and its resolve cannot be weakened by any misrepresentation of facts.\n\nThe statement reads:\n\nTo correct some inaccuracies in the information in the public space that NDLEA officers at the Enugu airport were the ones who received from the cartel details about the mule coming from Addis Ababa, the Agency wishes to quote from the transcript of Abba Kyari\u2019s recorded conversation with our undercover officer and a portion of ASP James Bawa\u2019s statement to the police as documented in the police investigation report, a copy of which was made available to the Agency, to state that it\u2019s an established fact that it\u2019s the Abba Kyari\u2019s team that was contacted by the cartel and without doubt, the records clearly show how their ring works. Recall that after NDLEA requested for Kyari and others for interrogation, they were questioned by the police, after which they were handed over along with the report of their interrogation.\n\nAccording to the police investigation report, ASP James Bawa, in his statement to the police, revealed that \u2018he was called by an informant identified as IK from Brazil who told him that a drug courier will be arriving onboard Ethiopian Airlines in Enugu. He explained further that a pointer from IK, the Brazil-based informant met with him at about 1420hrs on 19th January 2022 outside the airport and showed him a picture of the courier. Subsequently, they sighted the suspect as he exited the airport terminal after all arrival clearance formalities, and he was arrested with another associate.\n\nIn his own recorded conversation with our undercover officer, Abba Kyari also said the following: \u201cThey are greedy, seriously greedy (referring to his informants), we tried to have them accept 40% but they refused, except 50%, they know the rudiment of the deal very well, they are the ones that do the packing. From Brazil, one of the informants accompanied it to Ethiopia. You understand; one of the informants accompanied the goods to Ethiopia, one of the informants that give us information. He is the boy of the big baron.\n\n\u201cFrom Addis it will be given to those to proceed further with it, he will get their snapshots without their knowledge. Yes, he will reveal those that are conveying it further, get snapshots of theirs without their knowledge and send to us (Abba Kyari\u2019s team). So we already know the goods, pictures and the clothes they are wearing, hope you understand, we know your name, he will give us everything. So, automatically my team will just be waiting, they will just see you and arrest you.\u201d\n\nResponding to our officer\u2019s question on whether his boys are usually stationed inside or outside the airport, Abba Kyari said: \u201cYes, yes, some are outside while some are inside. They will just allow you to finish arrival formalities and arrest you the moment you come out.\u201d\n\nThe above no doubt establishes who the cartel was relating with and their modus operandi. Again, this is to correct inaccuracies in some reports and assure that the Agency will not deviate from an evidence-based investigation that will spare nobody found complicit.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has forwarded a proposal for the amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act to the National Assembly.\n\nIn a letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, he sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund the subsidy of Premium Motor Spirit in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe president said the supplementary budget had become necessary, as there was need to restore provisions for key projects, which was slashed by the National Assembly.\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, who disclosed this during plenary, yesterday, said the request was contained in a letter dated February 10, 2022.\n\nBuhari in the letter said it was imperative to remove all capital projects that were replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act, Lawan said.\n\nHe said 139 out of the 254 projects in the budget totalling N13.24 billion had been identified by the president for deletion.\n\nHe said the president requested the National Assembly to amend the Appropriation Act to provide for capital expenditures in the sum of N106,161,499,052 billion; and N43,870,592,044 billion for recurrent expenditures.\n\nIn a letter read by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, the president stated that \u201cit has become necessary to present this amendment proposal considering the impacts of the recent suspension of the Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy removal and the adverse implications that some changes made by the National Assembly in the 2022 Appropriation Act could have for the successful implementation of the budget.\u201d\n\nBuhari underscored the need to reinstate four capital projects totalling N1.4 billion in the Executive proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources; and N22.0 billion cut from the provision for the Sinking Fund to retire mature loans needed to meet government\u2019s obligations under already Issued Bonds.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cAs I indicated at the signing of the 2022 Appropriation Act, I forward herewith the Proposals for amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act (as detailed in Schedules I-V), for the kind consideration and approval by the Senate.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIt is important to restore the provisions made for various key capital projects in the 2022 Executive Proposal (see details in Schedule l) that were cut by the National Assembly. This is to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to this administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank. In addition, it is necessary to reinstate the four capital projects totalling N1.42 billion in the Executive Proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources that were removed in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding local contractors\u2019 debts and other liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature. It is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totalling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision. It is also imperative to reinstate the N22 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals. Similarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed.\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital project is that replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act; 139 out of the 254 such projects totalling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget. Some significant and non-mandate projects were introduced in the budgets of the Ministry of Transportation, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThere are several other projects that have been included by the National Assembly in the budgets of agencies that are outside their mandate areas. The Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning has been directed to work with your relevant committees to comprehensively identify and realign all such misplaced projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Appropriation Amendment request is for a total sum of N106,161,499,052 for Capital Expenditures and N43,870,592,044 for recurrent expenditures. I therefore request the National Assembly to make the above amendments without increasing the budget deficit. I urge you to roll back some of the N887.99 billion of projects earlier inserted in the budget by the National Assembly to accommodate these amendments.\n\n\u201cHowever, following the suspension of the PMS subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy. An additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation Account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.00 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion. Therefore, the amount available to fund the FGN Budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\n\n\u201cAggregate expenditure is projected to increase by N45.85 billion, due to additional domestic debt service provision of N102.5 billion net of the reductions in Statutory Transfers by N56.67 billion, as follows: NDDC, by N12.61 billion from N102.78 billion to N90.18 billion; NEDC, by N5.90 billion from N48.08 billion to N42.18 billion; UBEC, by N19.08 billion from N112.29 billion to N93.21 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, byN 9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion; and NASENI, by N9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion. Total budget deficit is projected to increase by N1.01 trillion to N7.40 trillion, representing 4.01% of GDP. The incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\u201d",

          "title": "Massive Oil Theft, High Pipeline Repairs Cost, Bleeding Nigeria\u2019s Economy",
          "text": "\u2022At 200,000bpd, over $29bn lost to theft in six years\n\n\u2022Over N700bn expended on repairs, maintenance\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA combination of huge oil pipeline repairs cost and a high-level crude oil theft are bleeding the Nigerian economy, with losses amounting to at least $29 billion in the last six years, spanning 2015 to 2021.\n\nIn February last year, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited disclosed that the country lost an average of 200,000 barrels per day of its crude oil production to saboteurs and illegal pilfering by criminals. At the time, the national oil company\u2019s Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, had said, \u201cWe have two sets of losses, one coming from our products and the other coming from crude oil. In terms of crude losses, it is still going on. On average, we are losing 200,000 bpd.\u201d Kyari said this in Abuja during a meeting with Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, to discuss collaborative efforts to curb the menace.\n\nThe amount, as revealed by Kyari, excluded NNPC\u2019s intermittent contracts for the rehabilitation of its downstream facilities, ranging from critical pipelines to depots and terminals, and the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) financing model, of which 96 companies from various jurisdictions indicated interest in 2021.\n\nAt the daily loss of 200, 000 barrels, it would be about 73 million barrels in a year and about 438 million barrels in six years under the current administration, to give roughly $29 billion when calculated over the period.\n\nA THISDAY analysis showed that at a projected 1.86 million barrels per day in 2021, the country recorded nearly 200 million barrels\u2019 crude deficit, out of a possible 700 million barrels yearly, in the first 11 months of the year.\n\nMoreover, statista.com, which tracks oil prices from 1960 till date, put the average price of oil per barrel in 2015 at $49.49, $40.76 in 2016, $52.51 in 2017, $69.78 in 2018, $64.04 in 2019, $41.47 in 2020, and $69.3 in 2021.\n\nUsing a median oil price of $64.5 for the six years multiplied by the 446.4 million barrels lost within the period, Nigeria lost approximately $29 billion in the last six years.\n\nIn 2021 alone, Nigeria was estimated to have lost as much as $4 billion, about 10 per cent of the country\u2019s foreign reserves, to oil theft, and also suffered a double jeopardy of spending its scarce resources on the maintenance of the incessantly breached oil assets.\n\nIn the last couple of months, due to its inability to ramp up production, despite growing international oil price, NNPC was only able to contribute N14 billion, N10.5 billion, and N20 billion, respectively, to the federation account, although it projected N209 billion monthly.\n\nRecently, THISDAY reported that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry had continued to haemorrhage, with the country losing as much as 6.596 million barrels in the December 2021 production circle. At an average of $75 per barrel for last month and a conservative official rate of N415/$1, Nigeria failed to take advantage of high international oil prices for the month, losing a whopping $487.5 million or roughly N202.3 billion.\n\nThe figures from NNPC indicated that the losses were due to a combination of factors, including force majeure declared by a Joint Venture (JV) partner. Other reasons listed by the national oil company included community issues, maintenance work, sabotage, and technical matters, like leakages, pressure build-up, and faulty valves.\n\nLamenting the huge hole the activities of oil thieves was digging in his company\u2019s revenue, Chairman of Heirs Holdings, Tony Elumelu, a few days ago said the company, Heirs Oil and Gas, was losing as much as 50,000 barrels of crude oil to criminals daily. Speaking last week, during a lecture he delivered to members of Course 30 of the National Defence College on the theme, \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d Elumelu described the situation as a national disgrace.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, thieves take 50,000 per day and, to me, this requires a national seminar or dialogue.\n\n\u201cIn my view, it is one of the highest levels of threat to our country because it\u2019s so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate, the country is not safe. They do that to us; they do that to other operators also.\u201d\n\nElumelu added, \u201cWe look forward to men and women in this room who will help remove this national disgrace and problems that we face.\u201d\n\nIn December, according to a THISDAY analysis, some of the assets, which took the greatest hits, included Bonny, which haemorrhaged to the tune of 2.712 million barrels for the month due to the force majeure declared on the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL).\n\nThe Urha terminal followed with 1.468 million barrel losses, which curtailed production within the period, thereby hobbling exports. For context, the loss from that particular terminal exceeded the country\u2019s production for the entire month.\n\nOdudu terminal also suffered the same fate due to decrease in production as a result of maintenance work on the Odudu and Ima terminal.\n\nFurthermore, Forcados shed 456,575 barrels of oil as a result of what NNPC described as community issues delaying reinstatement of the facility.\n\nBesides, Yoho dropped 420,000 barrels during the month owing to a faulty valve, Ajapa lost 30,000 barrels due to shutdown, while Aje terminal curtailed production within the period to the tune of 62,000 barrels.\n\nBrass was not spared as it suffered sabotage around Tebidada and Ogbaibiri flow stations as well as the valve issues, pressure build-up, high sand production, and leak repairs, resulting in a total loss of roughly 198,200 barrels.\n\nLast week, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) lamented that with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quota of 1.683 million bpd in January and 1.701 million bpd in February, Nigeria was only able to pump 1.396 million bpd currently. NUPRC stated that this was leading to a loss of at least 115,926 million bpd, put at roughly $300 million monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are losing about 115, 926 barrels per day, so that literally translates to roughly about $300 million and that\u2019s a huge loss to a nation that actually requires these funds,\u201d the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, stated.\n\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism, as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\n\n\u201cBut the larger percentage is due to crude oil theft and as a commission we know the impact of this and recognising our regulatory role, we have been able to reach out to other operators as to what we can do about this,\u201d he added.\n\nA former Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Waziri Adio, speaking on the matter recently, stressed that since Nigeria first reported oil losses, the situation had escalated and was taking its toll on the country.\n\nIn a period of 10 years, he stated, an analysis by NEITI put losses to oil theft at $41.9 billion, about $4.1 billion per year. He said aside its economic implications the losses also had security ramifications.\n\nAdio said, \u201cThis is something that causes a lot of risks, not just financially but also security wise. There are implications for the environment; there are implications for the Niger Delta, for health and safety.\n\n\u201cMost of the measures that have been put in place are not enough. They are inadequate and actually the problem is getting worse at a time when the country is in a very hard place.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have never had it this bad. Something really is going on. The enforcement of the law is very weak, the surveillance mechanism is weak, the security apparatus is also not clearly focused.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing in terms of technology, we are just scratching the surface. The problem is not new. It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s getting worse and it\u2019s getting worse because we have not done enough to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nBut aside the huge losses to oil theft, there\u2019s also the cost of repairing the lines when they are breached.\n\nLast year, the federal government said, through its spokesman, Mr. Lai Mohammed, that the government was spending N60 billion to repair and maintain vandalised oil and gas pipelines annually.\n\nThe minister, who spoke in July 2021 at a town hall meeting on protecting oil and gas infrastructure in Abuja, said between January 2019 and September 2020, 1,161 pipeline points across the country were vandalised.\n\n\u201cWith an average of 200,000 barrels per day lost to the wanton damage to pipelines and a huge amount of N60 billion yearly to repair and maintain the vandalised points, one can only imagine the impact on the economy,\u201d Mohammed stated.\n\nHowever, THISDAY checks revealed that this figure might be lower than what obtained in reality.\n\nData independently obtained from NNPC indicated that between January and December 2015, N103.4 billion was spent on pipeline repairs and management. From January to August 2015 alone, over 1,824 cases of breaks were reported on the pipelines.\n\nIn all, the government appears helpless, despite attempts in the past to reduce the incidence of vandalism and oil theft.\n\nBefore the Buhari administration, the preceding government had devised a strategy of hiring community members as guards, mostly hiring warlords from the areas who in turn hired those to be deployed at the facilities.\n\nIn 2011, reports said the federal government signed pipeline protection contracts worth at least $39.5 million a year with local guards. But NNPC\u2019s own data indicated that losses actually went up after the new contracts commenced.\n\nBut when Buhari took over, he frowned on the arrangement, put a halt to it, and literally described it as an insult to the Nigerian Armed Forces. He believed it insulted the security services that gang leaders were trusted to secure the country\u2019s assets, despite the existence of the armed forces.\n\nNeither Buhari\u2019s strategy, nor those of the presidents before him has worked.\n\nThe situation worsened in 2016, when the federal government spent N112 billion attempting to fix the problem, rising about N9 billion from the previous year.\n\nIn that year, N14 billion was incurred in February, N14.8 billion in July, and N14.9 billion in August. The lowest amount of N880 million was spent in January before aggrieved Niger Delta militants virtually brought the industry to its knees.\n\nAt least 2,560 vandalised points were recorded between January and December of that year. A check further showed that in 2017, N129.87 billion was spent on the phenomenon, while N137.44 billion was expended in 2018. But in 2019, the cost was reported as N127 billion.\n\nHowever, in 2020, the cost of repairs reduced considerably to N60.5 billion, and further fell to 29.5 billion in 2021, the least spending in years. The fall in the cost of repairs may not be unconnected with the fact that many of the pipes have now been abandoned.\n\nWhile oil theft is not a new phenomenon, with countries like Ghana, Morocco, Uganda, Mozambique, Mexico, Thailand, Azerbaijan, and Turkey experiencing different levels of theft, the volumes from Nigeria remain incredibly high.\n\nFor instance, while the stealing of oil across the global industry averaged 70,000 bpd of crude output in August 2020, Nigeria experienced significantly higher losses, with theft estimated at 200,000 barrels per day.\n\nHowever, it is believed that access to oil pipelines in Nigeria is markedly easier due to alleged connivance of top security operatives, ageing infrastructure, community acquiescence, as well as a complex web of complicity by contractors and oil companies\u2019 staff who gain when the pipelines are breached.\n\nWhile it is difficult to establish what happens on the high seas, where vessels allegedly load crude oil without requisite papers under the watchful eyes of the security operatives, those in the know insist that the high volume of the commodity moved out of the Niger Delta illegally would not be possible without connivance from top security agents.\n\nLeader of the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA) and a coalition of nine other militant groups in the Niger Delta, self-styled Johnmark Ezon-Ebi, in a chat with THISDAY earlier had alleged that high-ranking officials of government and security agencies were the major illegal oil \u2018bunkerers\u2019, who stole crude oil from Niger Delta and sold overseas through proxies.\n\nAn activist and National President of Ijaw Peoples Development Initiative (IPDI), Austin Ozobo, corroborated the claim and gave an insight into how the different categories of oil thieves in the region operated and settled security agents on the waterways.\n\nA legal practitioner and former President of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Eric Omare, said the connivance of security agents was well known. He added that his concerns were the effect of oil bunkering on the environment and the fact that due to joblessness, graduates had joined the oil bunkering business.\n\nIn the same vein, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State had also accused a serving General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division of the Nigerian Army of promoting oil theft in the Niger Delta.\n\nIn November last year, Wike again doubled down on the matter, alleging that the fight to stop oil theft had continued to fail because top-ranking military officers were involved.\n\nSince this year, Wike has repeatedly accused the Nigeria Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) of connivance. In one instance, the governor alleged that a Divisional Police Officer (DPO) actually owned one of the illegal refineries in the state.\n\nIn 2018, an indigenous oil company, Aiteo, took the unprecedented step of raising the alarm about security forces involvement in illegal oil bunkering and breaking of pipelines. It accused a then Joint Task Force (JTF) operating in the region of complicity.\n\nThese cases either went without investigation or the outcome of the investigations were not made public. However, the security forces have always denied involvement.\n\nNigeria has been unable to meet its allocation by OPEC, which was 1.68 million bpd for January 2022 and 1.701 million barrels per day for February, and barely exceeded 1.25 million bpd in the last few months.\n\nAlthough questions remain over the real motives for planning to exit their onshore and shallow water operations, a handful of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria have cited costs related to oil pipelines and general insecurity as reasons for their actions.\n\nFigures from NNPC indicated that the country lost 42.25 million barrels in 2019, and 53.28 million barrels in the year prior, owing to oil theft, but the situation might have worsened in 2021.\n\nNEITI, the country\u2019s oil industry auditor, in 2019, suggested the country had lost around 138,000 bpd of crude to theft over the previous decade, at a value of around $40.06 billion.\n\nDespite several efforts, including the setting up of a special security outfit, Operation Delta Safe, a coalition of all the security agencies in the country, and the establishment of several committees, including the one for recovery of crude oil and illegally refined petroleum products, the results have been largely negative.\n\nIn response to a query raised in a 2016 report of the Auditor General for the Federation (AuGF), NNPC had put the money spent on pipeline repairs within five years as well as the money lost as a result of product losses at N966 billion. The corporation said the N966 billion expenses and losses were incurred between 2010 and 2015.\n\nBut a senate panel had insisted on probing NNPC for an alleged failure to remit N4 trillion into the federation account as contained in the AuGF report.\n\n\u201cAside the above, pipeline repairs and products losses so incurred stood at N966 billion for the same period,\u201d it stated in the defence.\n\nIn June last year, NNPC began collaborating with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Police, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), and NSCDC to try to curb the menace. That move has also been largely unfruitful.\n\nBut NNPC has always insisted that working with the local communities would be one of the most effective ways to halt the theft of crude oil and vandalism of the country\u2019s pipelines.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is continuously working in collaboration with the local communities and other stakeholders to reduce and eventually eliminate the pipeline vandalism menace,\u201d the company said in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR).\n\nHowever, a Pricewaterhouse Coopers forensic audit, which reviewed and analysed pipeline repairs spending claimed by NNPC found that most of the expenses were \u201cunsubstantiated costs\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "A THISDAY analysis showed that at a projected 1.86 million barrels per day in 2021, the country recorded nearly 200 million barrels\u2019 crude deficit, out of a possible 700 million barrels yearly, in the first 11 months of the year.\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism, as well as technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\nIn a period of 10 years, he stated, an analysis by NEITI put losses to oil theft at $41.9 billion, about $4.1 billion per year.\nIn all, the government appears helpless, despite attempts in the past to reduce the incidence of vandalism and oil theft.\nSince this year, Wike has repeatedly accused the Nigeria Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) of connivance.",

          "text": "\u2022Sends N2.557trn supplementary budget for petrol subsidy \u2022Asks Senate to amend 2022 Appropriation Act\n\nSunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu and Juliet Akojie in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday criticised the National Assembly for removing crucial projects from the 2022 budget estimates sent to it by the executive and inserting the lawmakers\u2019 projects to the tune of N887 billion in the fiscal document before it was signed into law.\n\nHe also accused the federal lawmakers of making unnecessary incursion into the operational areas of the executive.\n\nThis was just as the president has asked the National Assembly to amend the 2022 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly in December, 2021.\n\nThe requests were contained in a letter dated February 10, 2022, and read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari in the letter, he also said it was imperative to remove all capital projects that were replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nHe lamented that 139 out of the 254 projects in the budget totaling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe president, therefore, requested the National Assembly to amend the Appropriation Act to provide for capital expenditure in the sum of N106,161,499,052 billion; and N43,870,592,044 billion for recurrent expenditure.\n\nHe also requested that an additional provision for N2.557 trillion be appropriated by the National Assembly to fund the petrol subsidy in the 2022 budget framework which was revised to provide fully for PMS subsidy.\n\nBuhari stressed the need to reinstate four capital projects totaling N1.4 billion in the executive proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources.\n\nHe said N22 billion should be cut from the provision for the Sinking Fund to retire mature loans needed to meet government\u2019s obligations under already Issued Bonds.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totaling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision (see Schedule l).\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative to reinstate the N22 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital projects that are replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act. 139 out of the 254 such projects totaling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSome significant and non-mandate projects were introduced in the budgets of the Ministry of Transportation, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation\n\n\u201cThere are several other projects that have been included by the National Assembly in the budgets of agencies that are outside their mandate areas.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning has been directed to work with your relevant Committees to comprehensively identify and realign all such misplaced projects.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to restore the titles / descriptions of 32 projects in the Appropriation Act to the titles contained in the Executive Proposal for the Ministry of Water Resources (see Schedule IV) in furtherance of our efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects.\n\nThe president also sought the approval of the federal parliament for a fresh request of N150 billion.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding Local Contractors\u2019 Debts and Other Liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth.\u201d\n\nThe president said the N2.557 trillion fresh requests was to enable the federal government to subsidise petrol from June to December this year.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the suspension of the petrol subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy.\n\n\u201cAn additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation account (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2 trillion while FGN\u2019s share from the account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the amount available to fund the federal budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He said Seedu helped them buy cars at the police headquarters, Eleweran,\u201d Damilola said.\n\nHe opted for a vehicle worth N3million.\n\n\u201cOn September 8, 2021, I journeyed to Coutonu, Benin Republic, with the dealer to get my car. He asked me to send N3million to a certain bank account and told me to go back to Nigeria,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen I got home, I told the police officer everything, and he assured me that the man was trustworthy. In fact, he said the same man helped some senior officers, including the PPRO, Abimbola Oyeyemi, secure their vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe next time Damilola spoke with the dealer, he was told to expect his car in one week, but he had not seen the vehicle.\n\n\u201cWe talked via phone call and voice chat, but since the beginning of this year, he hasn\u2019t picked up my calls or replied to my chats,\u201d Damilola said.\n\nOn getting a report of what had happened, the PPRO pleaded with Damilola, saying Seedu would deliver the vehicle.\n\n\u201cHe said I needed to be patient with him, adding that he would call him to start picking my calls. But up till now, he does not pick my calls nor reply to my chats,\u201d said Damilola.\n\nOn February 13, 2022, Damilola got a hint from his friends that the dealer was in a car wash around Olomore, Ogun State. He went there, but sighting him, the man drove off.\n\nSeedu drove to Lafenwa Police Station to accuse Damilola and his friends of attempting to lynch him.\n\n\u201cI, Saheed, Azeez and Gafar were paraded by the police,\u201d said Damilola.\n\n\u201cThey said we attempted to rob Seedu and that we also broke his glasses. The manager of the car wash and other witnesses told the police that what Seedu said was not true.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, the dealer reported the incident to the Ogun police spokesperson, and he ordered the DPO of Lafenwa to detain the accused, according to Damilola.\n\nHe said the DPO of Lafenwa police station was willing to help after hearing his ordeal, but was scared of the police spokesperson.\n\nWhen Oyeyemi, the Ogun police spokesperson, was contacted, he said he was in a meeting.",

          "text": "Gift Ohanazeze, mother of the 19-month-old pupil of Arise and Shine Nursery and Primary School, Asaba, Delta State, who was reportedly flogged to death has called for justice for her son.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters on Wednesday, the young woman explained that she had barely enrolled her son in the school before the sad incident occurred.\n\nOhanazeze said she was a single mother who had been struggling to take care of the child and had just moved to Asaba and in a bid to get a job, she enrolled her son in the school.\n\nShe lamented that she made a mistake of not making enquiries before taking the child to the school considering the bad history of the school in the community where a teacher had allegedly removed the fingernails of a baby while beating the child.\n\nMeanwhile, an autopsy will be carried out on the corpse of the little boy today (Wednesday) to ascertain the cause of his death, the mother said. See Also News I Disciplined The Late Toddler As Expected \u2014 Delta Teacher Who Flogged 19-Month-Old Baby To Death\n\nRecall that the state police commissioner, Ari Muhammed Ali had said a post mortem would be conducted to determine the cause of death of the deceased child.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, the mother said, \u201cMy son was one year and seven months. The day I went to meet the school boss that they flogged my child; she told me that my baby was disturbing the school, she said do I know the gravity of my son's offence? I asked her what the gravity of offence a child of 1 year, 7 months would commit? She said the boy was disturbing the school; that was all she said.\n\n\u201cHer son, at the police station, said Obinna was playing with water, she questioned him that where the tap is, Obinna's hand could not get there, that's what the proprietress told the GRA police station.\n\n\u201cThe son again claimed that he pushed another child and hit his head when they were interviewing him yesterday but some other children at the school said Obinna was only crying, took his lunch box to the proprietress, she took the box from him, dropped it and called the son and a teacher, they tied Obinna and she was the one flogging, not her son. The son is just an accomplice who held the leg of my child, while the other one held the hand.\n\n\u201cMy son is barely two weeks in that school, he was a new intake; that was his eighth day, even the uniform they gave him, he had not worn some of them, he only wore one. This is his first time of going to school. I had to register him because I didn't have a job, I barely feed so I couldn't register him but now, I had to gather money to register him so I can also look for a job.\n\n\u201cThe proprietress and the son are in the police station but the other lady who held the leg ran away, they've not seen her since then.\n\n\u201cIt was after my son's incident I learnt that they really beat children in that school, there are kids with bruises on their legs, they injure some; they once removed a baby's fingernail while beating. People were saying this is not the first time. The problem is I just relocated to Asaba so I didn't know. I even live in an uncompleted building and I had not stayed up to one month in that compound. The mistake I made is, I didn't ask questions, I didn't know.\n\n\u201cThe police said the autopsy will be conducted today, as I speak to you, I'm at the mortuary, we are waiting for the police officers to come so we can take the corpse. From what I'm seeing the governor is really interested in this case, he's doing his best, he's fighting like this boy is his son, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa is trying his best to ensure I get justice. Even the commissioner, she is also trying, she was the one that said they must conduct autopsy today.\n\n\u201cIt was one Mr Saviour that helped me to amplify my voice, he was the one who started this fight even when the child was flogged. The children in school said they couldn't even count if it was 31 strokes or more.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had broken the story of how the late toddler was beaten by the school administrators.\n\nThe sad incident was made known by Ebenezer Omejalile, Chief Operating Officer of Advocates for Children and Vulnerable People's Network, a human rights group.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that the baby, a pupil of Arise and Shine Nursery and Primary School, Asaba, Delta State, was given 31 strokes of the cane for playing with water and getting wet.\n\nThe mother of the victim had said that the act was perpetrated by the school owner and her son, who tied the hands and legs of the baby before flogging him into a coma.\n\nThe woman and her son, who were initially in police custody but released after reaching an agreement with the victim's family, were rearrested on Saturday after the baby died.",

          "title": "MATTERS ARISING: FBI fraud allegation, NDLEA drug-dealing claim \u2014 will DCP Kyari be tried in Nigeria or US?",
          "text": "The allegations against Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police, took a startling dimension on Monday when the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) declared him wanted for alleged drug-dealing.\n\nFemi Babalola, spokesperson of the NDLEA, in a press briefing, said the anti-drug agency strongly believes that \u201cDCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA\u2019s revelation comes months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari of conspiring with Hushpuppi, self-confessed international fraudster, in a $1.1 million scam targeting Qatari business people.\n\nThe FBI secured a court order for Kyari\u2019s extradition and arrest over his alleged involvement in the Hushpuppi fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suspended police officer denied the allegation, claiming that his \u201chands are clean\u201d.\n\nAmid the allegation, Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police, set up a panel to probe the allegations against Kyari. A few weeks later the panel submitted its report.\n\nRecently, the Police Service Commission (PSC) directed that a different panel be constituted to further investigate Kyari\u2019s case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyari has been under investigation since July 2021, and there is the speculation that the federal government is foot-dragging on the matter so as to scuttle the extradition.\n\nSome Nigerians have alleged that the NDLEA\u2019s allegation against Kyari is a ploy by the federal government to truncate his extradition.\n\nHere, TheCable puts into perspective what the law says about extradition in the light of the litany of allegations against Kyari \u2014 home and abroad.\n\nWHAT IS EXTRADITION AND HOW DOES IT WORKS WITH NIGERIA?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExtradition is a formal action in which a particular jurisdiction upon request hands over an accused or convicted person to another jurisdiction where an alleged offence was committed.\n\nHushpuppi, for instance, was arrested in Dubai, but handed over to the US for prosecution.\n\nNigeria has several laws and treaties guiding the extradition of its citizens to other countries. Treaties on extradition have been signed by Nigeria and some countries to facilitate the extradition of accused persons.\n\nFor instance, the Extradition Treaty 1935 was signed by Nigeria, the US and the UK. The provisions in the treaty are binding on the three countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, for an extradition process to commence in Nigeria, there must be a diplomatic request from the representative of that country to the attorney-general of the federation. The request must be accompanied by a duly authenticated warrant of arrest or certificate of conviction issued in that country.\n\nSecond, the attorney-general of the federation having considered the facts presented by the requesting country may make an order to a court requesting that the case be determined for extradition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe attorney-general also has the powers to reject the extradition request if the alleged offence has political colouration or the alleged offender is being targeted on the basis of race, religion or nationality.\n\nSection 6 of the Extradition Act states: \u201c(a) A request for the surrender of a fugitive criminal of any country shall be made in writing to the attorney-general by a diplomatic representative or consular officer of that country and shall be accompanied by a duly authenticated warrant of arrest or certificate of conviction issued in that country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d(b) Where such a request is made to him, the attorney-general may by an order under his hand signify to a magistrate that such a request has been made and require the magistrate to deal with the case in accordance with the provisions of this Act, but shall not make such an order if he decides on the basis of information then available to him that the surrender of the fugitive is precluded by any of the provisions of subsection (1) to (7) of section 3 of this Act.\u201d\n\nDID DCP KYARI BREACH ANY EXTRADITABLE OFFENCE?\n\nThere have been arguments on whether the allegations levelled by the FBI against the suspended IRT boss constitute an extraditable offence.\n\nArticle 3 of the Extradition Treaty 1935, which was signed by Nigeria, the US and the UK, highlighted offences that are worthy of extradition.\n\nA review of article 3 of the treaty shows that the allegations levelled against Kyari by the FBI fall under number 17 and 18 of the highlighted offences in article 3.\n\nArticle 3 states that: \u201cExtradition shall be reciprocally granted for the following crimes or offences:\n\n\u201c17. Fraud by a bailee, banker, agent, factor, trustee, director, member, or public officer of any company, or fraudulent conversion.\n\n\u201c18. Obtaining money, valuable security, or goods, by false pretences; receiving any money, valuable security, or other property, knowing the same to have been stolen or unlawfully obtained.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in an interview, Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, On February 6, said the federal government is working with the US on the \u201cpossible extradition\u201d of Kyari.\n\nMalami added that the police panel has established \u201creasonable grounds for suspicion\u201d which could lead to Kyari\u2019s extradition.\n\nKYARI\u2019S ALLEGED DRUG-DEALING OFFENCE IN NIGERIA VIS-A-VIS EXTRADITION\n\nThe Extradition Act states conditions in which an accused person cannot be extradited to the requesting country.\n\nOne of such conditions as stipulated in section 3 (f) of the law is that the accused person shall not be surrendered if he or she is charged with an offence under a Nigerian law until the expiration of the sentence or prosecution, particularly when the offence is different from the one allegedly committed in the requesting country.\n\nSection 3 (f) states: \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or\n\n\u201c(b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence, or otherwise.\u201d\n\nThere is a possibility that the suspended IRT boss could be charged and arraigned in court by the NDLEA for offences bordering on drug trafficking.\n\nIf Kyari is arraigned by the NDLEA for drug-related offences, which is a breach of Nigerian law, the provisions of section 3(f) of the Extradition Act could serve as an impediment to his extradition to the US.\n\nLAWYERS SPEAK\n\nSpeaking on the development, Festus Ogun, human rights lawyer, told TheCable that if the NDLEA files charges against Kyari the action will \u201csucceed in hindering and frustrating\u201d his extradition process to the US.\n\n\u201cThe simple interpretation of the above provision of the law (referring to section 3 of the Extradition Act) in respect to this case is that any extradition application made against Abba Kyari shall be rejected if the NDLEA decides to charge him with an offence, under Nigerian law, other than the offence for which his surrender is sought in the US, that is the crime he allegedly committed in connection with Hushpuppi,\u201d Ogun said.\n\n\u201cWhile it is desirable that the NDLEA gets to the root of this drug cartel matter involving Abba Kyari by ensuring that those found wanting after thorough investigation are charged before a competent court of record, such an action will only succeed in hindering and frustrating his (Kyari\u2019s) extradition.\u201d\n\nOgun added that Malami has the power as the attorney-general to ensure \u201csubstantial justice\u201d in the prosecution of Kyari by the NDLEA and extradition to the US.\n\nAnother human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong told TheCable that the \u201csensible\u201d decision is for the federal government to extradite Kyari to the US for prosecution.\n\nEffiong added that the suspended IRT boss can still be brought back to Nigeria to face trial after the outcome of his prosecution in the US.\n\n\u201cMy opinion remains that let the case in the US take precedence, whatever the outcome of that case, he can always be brought back to Nigeria to face trial for the offence relating to alleged involvement in hard drugs,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\n\u201cThis is the sensible thing to do. Otherwise, it will not be unfounded to assume that this may have been orchestrated after all to frustrate his extradition since the narcotic allegation is not related to the case presented by the FBI.\u201d",
          "summary": "The FBI secured a court order for Kyari\u2019s extradition and arrest over his alleged involvement in the Hushpuppi fraud.\nAmid the allegation, Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police, set up a panel to probe the allegations against Kyari.\nSome Nigerians have alleged that the NDLEA\u2019s allegation against Kyari is a ploy by the federal government to truncate his extradition.\nArticle 3 states that: \u201cExtradition shall be reciprocally granted for the following crimes or offences:\u201c17.\nKYARI\u2019S ALLEGED DRUG-DEALING OFFENCE IN NIGERIA VIS-A-VIS EXTRADITIONThe Extradition Act states conditions in which an accused person cannot be extradited to the requesting country.",

          "title": "Is Africa\u2019s tech startup ecosystem set for a debt financing boom?",
          "text": "Last year, 37 African tech startups raised a total of $767 million in 43 debt rounds, indicating the rise of the debt funding class and increasing global lender confidence in African tech, per Partech\u2019s report on venture capital funding in Africa.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s tech ecosystem has set its sights on another asset class to help fuel growth,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWhile debt funding remains widely underreported and undisclosed, it is growing to prominence in the fundraising strategy of African startups.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the first time Partech will be reporting on debt in its annual report. According to its findings, Nigerian startups raised 45% or $345 million of the total amount of debt recorded, the fintech sector accounted for over 54%, and there were 34 unique debt investors, with Lendable and the IFC being some of the most active.\n\n\u201cAs the [African tech startup] ecosystem matures, more companies will do a combination of debt and equity [funding rounds],\u201d said Dare Okoudjou, CEO and founder of MFS Africa in October 2021. Okoudjou\u2019s statement came after the pan-African fintech giant closed a $100 million Series C financing round\u2014split between $70 million equity and $30 million debt.\n\nMost startups looking to raise money during their formative years typically consider equity, which requires that founders give away shares in their business in exchange for capital. At that stage, the venture is extremely risky and thus doesn\u2019t appeal to most financing options (like debt that requires repayment at an agreed-upon date with interest) except venture capital.\n\n\u201cDebt investors usually look for predictable cash flows or transferable assets (such as real estate) to secure their exposures. For most startups, both of these are in short supply,\u201d Rahul Shah, Head of Financials Equity Research at Tellimer, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nBecause the majority of startups are early-stage, debt takes up a small slice of the broader market for private tech financing. According to Ayobamigbe Teriba, an ex-analyst at Ingressive Capital, debt financing is viable to businesses but tricky.\n\n\u201cA lot of [early-stage] companies don\u2019t consider it [debt] because of the criteria tied to accessing them, which is different from equity,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it allows founders retain ownership, access criteria can be more tedious than equity funding that\u2019s been the anchor in the ecosystem and is based on stages of the startups.\u201d\n\nBut as an ecosystem matures and growing startups choose to stay private longer, funding alternatives like debt become viable and interest grows. \u201cAs startups grow and achieve some predictability, debt financing can be a useful instrument,\u201d the Partech report notes. \u201cIt helps accelerate growth while limiting dilution from equity rounds.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThere\u2019s no available data on how much debt African startups have attracted over the years. But several funding announcements last year\u2014when Africa\u2019s venture capital funding hit the $5 billion mark\u2014suggest 2021 saw an acceleration in serious appetite for debt financing. Apart from MFS Africa, Moove, Trella, and TradeDepot are some of the startups that announced debt rounds.\n\nBecause the ecosystem is at a stage where further financing is needed by many fast-growing startups, more debt financing announcements should be expected this year, predicts Kunle Akinola, an investment analyst at Lagos-based private equity firm Platform Capital.\n\n\u201cAfrica minted 5 new unicorns in 2021, which indicates growth. As a founder of one of these or another growth-stage company, you probably don\u2019t want to be issuing equity unnecessarily to finance acquisitions or capital expenses during growth and expansion,\u201d Akinola said.\n\nThe Partech report notes, In addition, that strategic debt players have launched dedicated debt funds targeted to emerging markets \u2013 Africa in particular.\n\nLast October, emerging markets-focused lender Lendable announced a plan to raise a $100 million fund targeting African and Asian fintech companies. It participated in MFS Africa\u2019s $100 million funding round with $30 million debt and has backed many startups in Africa.\n\nDevelopment finance institutions like the United Kingdom\u2019s CDC, the Dutch development bank, and the IFC are also leaders in this financing segment. The latter has so far deployed debt to back TradeDepot, Bolt, Kobo360, etc. \u201cI expect we\u2019ll see a major uptick in the deployment of debt by existing players and new entrants,\u201d Teriba said.\n\nWith the growing uptick in debt funding activity in Africa, which companies are best suited for the financing option?\n\nPer Rahul Shah, industries with debt-friendly assets or business models have a better chance of accessing this financing source. \u201cFor example, financial companies looking to fund their lending, particularly where they can point to strong risk management to reduce the uncertainty in repayment cashflows,\u201d he said.\n\nIn MFS Africa\u2019s case, it raised debt funding to finance the floats needed for real-time settlements. \u201cWe realized we don\u2019t need to raise equity since there is a debt market for that,\u201d the CEO said at the time.\n\nAnother emerging sector with access to debt financing is renewable energy: physical infrastructure (such as solar panels) and supply contracts can give debt investors the comfort that they will be repaid. In this space, West Africa-focused solar providers like Starsight and Daystar Power have largely leveraged debt to fund operations.\n\n\u201cIn such cases, debt financing can make more sense than equity financing; asset and liability cash flows are better-matched, and returns to equity-holders can be enhanced,\u201d the Tellimer head said.\n\nShort-term debt financing can also be accessed if it is backed by inventory; for example, e-commerce retailers and their suppliers. In contrast, companies with non-transferable intangible assets (such as early-stage biotech) would likely struggle to obtain debt finance.\n\nEssentially, debt is hinged on the cash flow or revenue models of companies. Once the models become reliable and the product-market fit is underlined, debt investors become more open to funding a startup.\n\nBased on the ongoing trend, Africa is poised to witness a surge in founders seeking debt financing for their startups in the coming years.\n\n\u201cWe are starting from a very low base; in that sense, volumes can only increase from here,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAs the current cadre of African startups matures, they will become more attractive to debt investors given they have demonstrable track records. And as the continent\u2019s startup debt investors become more experienced, their risk appetite will improve.\u201d\n\nTeriba adds that more startups are likely to engage capital markets, institutional lenders for credit to \u201cexpand and stabilise their business offerings.\u201d\n\nWhile the near-term growth prospects are strong, a key medium-term headwind is the global monetary tightening cycle as developed countries, where the bulk of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from, roll back monetary measures meant to help businesses tide over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe era of cheap and plentiful money is coming to an end, and that will ultimately constrain end-investor appetite for the riskiest forms of debt,\u201d Shah added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nSo, anyone familiar with tertiary education in Nigeria knows about the striking tradition. Most government-run university students have lost blocks of time due to strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Under President Buhari\u2019s administration, students have lost 13 months to strikes.\n\nThere seems to be no respite in sight, and this week, the body declared a \u201ccomprehensive and total\u201d four-week strike. In a separate development, the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, is embroiled in a dispute with ASUU over its decision to make Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Communication, Isa Pantami, a professor.\n\nWhile we hope that the strike ends quickly, we encourage students to use any opportunity to gain relevant skills while waiting for the strike to be called off. While you\u2019re here, we\u2019d appreciate it if you could take a minute to share this newsletter with at least three people on your contact list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The newsletter edition dated February 15, 2022, erroneously reported that the European Union plans to invest $927 billion under its global gateway initiative. The correct figure is $927 million.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest:\n\nLocal competition for Uber\n\nWasla\u2019s $9 million raise\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\nLocal competition for Uber?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos is famous for many things. From its entrepreneurial spirit to dare-devil danfo drivers who will test your patience. But perhaps, its most notable feature is its traffic.\n\nWhile the British use the weather as a conversation starter, Nigerians use Lagos traffic to start conversations.\n\nLike any problem, the traffic situation has led various entrepreneurs to build solutions with local startups like Treepz, Touch and Pay, and Shuttlers joining foreign brands like Uber and Bolt to provide convenient transportation solutions.\n\nOne local player is Transtura, a mobility startup founded by Vincent Adeoba that provides a convenient mode of transportation using shuttle minibuses. What began from renting out his car to be used on Uber has grown into a startup serving 2,500 users. However, the company has not stopped there, recently acquiring W\u00e0z\u00f3 as it plans to roll out payment solutions.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo had a chat with the founders a few weeks ago, where they shared insights from their journey and plans for the future.

The startup has announced an investment of $9 million from Contact Financial Holding, a financial services provider in Egypt.\n\nThe startup offers its users a wide array of services enabling them to save while shopping. These services include a deal finder and cashback points that can be used for airtime and gift cards. Following the fresh injection of capital, the startup plans to introduce buy now, pay later options and a new online payment option for its users.\n\nWith 1.5 million downloads, Wasla is eyeing regional expansion with plans to expand to Nigeria. Speaking to TechCrunch, CEO El-Said said, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market at the end of the day, you have roughly 250 million people. They\u2019re very technologically advanced, and their adoption of eCommerce is quite good.\u201d\n\nMoneyHash\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccepting payments is a significant challenge for businesses across the globe. With several payment providers, it is often difficult to harmonise a business\u2019 payment stack. In Europe and America, payment orchestration platforms have been built, providing a faster way for businesses to receive payments and easing the expansion process.\n\nMoneyHash, an Egyptian startup, has raised $3 million in pre-seed funding for this purpose after launching in 2021. The startup, which claims to be the first payment orchestration and revenue operations platform in the Middle East/Africa, raised its pre-seed round from investors including Nuwa Capital, First Check Africa, VentureSouq, VentureFriends, and angel investors like NerdWallet Co-founders, Tim Chen and Jake Gibson and Belvo Co-founder, Oriol Tintore.\n\nFounded by Nadir Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash is currently testing its product with 17 companies, five of which are active and paying companies. It charges these companies between $150 and $1,000 with transaction fees starting from 10 cents and reducing as payment volume increases.\n\nCurrently operating in Egypt, the company intends to use its pre-seed funding to drive growth across the Middle East and Africa as it aims to become the AWS of payments in the Middle East and Africa.\n\n\u201cWhat AWS did to the cloud, where it made it easy for companies to build as many services on top of the infrastructure, we think the payment industry, especially in emerging markets, is very fragmented and needs an AWS for money, which MoneyHash is doing when you connect with it and build as much as you need without needing to change anything,\u201d CEO Abdelrazik said in a chat with TechCrunch.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nCrime and NFTs: Chainalysis Detects Significant Wash Trading and Some Money Laundering In this Emerging Asset Class\n\nNigeria\u2019s sleepless students trying to beat the Lagos traffic\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a productive day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "How Healthdart is providing affordable and accessible healthcare in South Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from education, there is probably no other industry that contributes as much to the development of a society like healthcare. Unhealthy individuals can\u2019t build businesses, fight for good governance, or create life-changing innovations. So it\u2019s no surprise that some of the poorest countries in the world have the worst quality of healthcare.\n\nBefore it was stopped in 2000, the highest-ranked African country in the World Health Organization\u2019s health system rankings was Morocco in 29th position. Tunisia, the next in the continent, was in 52nd place. Not much has changed in the 21 years since. A report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) described healthcare in Africa as the worst globally, with 50% of healthcare expenditure out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMuch like the education sector, developments in Africa\u2019s healthcare space are driven by the private sector as underfunded public health facilities struggle to meet demand. In South Africa, one healthtech startup is helping South Africans access drugs and health advice using their phones. I sat down with one of the startup\u2019s co-founders \u2013 Healthdart \u2013 to learn more about its operations.\n\nMission-driven entrepreneurship\n\nIn the early 2000s, South Africa had an HIV crisis on its hands. About to get into the university, Njabulo Skhosana decided to study pharmacology at the University of Liverpool. The plan was to learn how he could help stem the tide, but he took a different route with stints at Bupa, Deloitte, and Discovery Health. The one constant thing in all these jobs was healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2020, just a few weeks after the government imposed lockdowns in South Africa, he quit his job as the Chief of Staff to the CEO at Discovery Health to build Healthdart \u2013 a one-stop-shop for primary health care services.\n\nBringing primary health care closer to the people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart co-founders, L-R, Yauvan Hansraj (CTO), Njabulo Skhosana (CEO), and Tshwanelo Matsane (CPO). Source: Healthdart\n\nMost plans to improve healthcare in Africa are focused on secondary care, with primary healthcare often an afterthought. As a result, most Africans ignore symptoms of ill health until they get really serious. The disadvantage of this approach is that conditions that could have been prevented or treated early may now be too advanced for the patient to get help.\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution uses an app to provide a platform where users can place orders for their drugs and have them delivered at less than the cost of the cheapest two-way bus ride (R30 or $1.99) in South African townships. Customers can choose to pay using electronic funds transfer before they receive the drugs or at the point of exchange using a card or cash.\n\nOne might ask what is so special about providing an avenue for patients to order and have their drugs delivered to them where they choose. Let me paint a picture. Imagine that you had a cold and got a prescription from a doctor; however, you have to journey to the nearest pharmacy to get the medication because there are no pharmacies close to you.\n\nAssuming you had a job and this happened during the week, you would have to take some time off from work to get your prescription. If you\u2019re fortunate, you could get your boss to give you the time you need. Yet, even with permission, people living in South Africa\u2019s townships have to take long and often stressful journeys without an assurance that they will get the drugs they need.\n\nAnd this is where Healthdart steps in. The startup does not just deliver drugs to patients; it also facilitates virtual and physical consultations with doctors and nurses. Consequently, the startup can provide comprehensive access to primary health care services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart delivers its solution via an app and yet targets middle-income neighbourhoods. With less disposable income, this society is less likely to have a smartphone, and I was curious to know how Healthdart intends to reach them.\n\n\u201cI think if you asked me that question five years ago, we would not have been able to start the business. Right now, we find that people can get basic android phones at low prices within the South African market,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis reply corresponds to a 2020 report from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) that claims that the smartphone penetration in South Africa stands at ~91%. Even with that, the startup ensures that at 17 megabytes, the app is light enough to run on low-end smartphones while it uses WhatsApp to complement its customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution is not novel, and there are startups across Africa that either offer a platform for patients to order drugs or speak with a physician. Still, Skhosana argues that Healthdart provides more than convenience to its customers.\n\n\u201cA huge part of our value proposition is reducing the total cost of care, and that is very different from what our competitors do. In most cases, the focus is on convenience, almost like trying to create an UberEats for medicine. But we see our role as a lot more integral to the person\u2019s lifestyle and just trying to make it as easy and affordable as possible for them to access the right level of healthcare that they need.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\nSince its launch, Healthdart has primarily focused on a few South African townships. However, it plans to add more townships and cities to the areas it currently covers before exploring possible expansion options. In this time, the startup has facilitated more than 1,000 medication orders and health consultations across Johannesburg.\n\nInitially incubated in the Founders Factory Africa, it has also raised money from BFA Global\u2019s Catalyst Fund as it moves towards building a one-stop-shop for primary healthcare service in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 140 million internet subscribers have mostly conducted their online business on microwave internet or 2G and 3G networks. The country has higher coverage of both networks with 2G at over 70 percent and 3G at 50 percent.\n\nCompared to 4G and 5G networks, the speeds of these networks are exceptionally slow. The average speed of 3G connections is 3 megabits per second (Mbps), which is 30 times faster than the 2G average speed of 100 kilobits per second (or 0.1 Mbps). Some connections could achieve speeds of 7Mbps.\n\nNevertheless, they work quite well with VoIP, video conferencing, web browsing, office 365, and any other specialist software. And their ease of deployment, suitability to different terrains ensuring they reach the last mile, and lower cost compared to 4G and 5G, make them attractive for many operators.\n\nTheir attractiveness, however, pales in comparison to the speeds of 4G and 5G networks. To put it in context, it would take roughly 40 minutes on 4G to download two full seasons of The Office, which is 5GB in size. It would take over 2 hours to download on 3G. 5G reduced the time it would take to download the same seasons to a mere 35 seconds.\n\n4G boasts peak speeds clocking in at 150Mbps upload and 50Mbps download speeds. These are vast improvements over 3G, yet Nigeria has yet to realise the full potential of 4G which only has 37 percent coverage in the country.\n\nBut the attention of the NCC is already turning to 5G deployment, which the auction concluded in December, and winners are expected to complete payment in February 2022.\n\nInasmuch as 5G holds more promise for internet speeds and service, the economics of deploying the technology is steep for operators in a country where previous networks generations have yet to gain wide penetration.\n\nHere are six areas that could present the most cost challenge identified by researchers at Advocaat, a legal services firm.\n\nInadequate fibre optic infrastructure\n\nThere are five subsea cables that have landed on Nigerian shores. These include MainOne (10Tb), SAT3/SAFE (800Gb); Glo1 (2.5Tb), ACE (5Tb), and WACS (14.5Tb) with a combined capacity of 32.800Tbps. While Nigeria expects these assets to provide high-speed internet to the country, only about 10 percent of the capacity has been utilised.\n\nMost of the country\u2019s internet needs are served by mobile broadband, which is the marketing term for wireless internet access through a portable modem, mobile phone, USB wireless modem, table, or other mobile devices. 2G and 3G services are mainly provided through mobile broadband. Fixed broadband which is through fibre optic cable remains at a very low level of deployment.\n\nIt is estimated that to achieve full broadband penetration, 120,000km of fibre needs to be installed, given Nigeria\u2019s landmass. Nigeria reportedly has a deficit of about 80,000km of fibre which needs to be met before effective nationwide deployment of broadband can be achieved. The operators also suffer vandalism and damage to existing fibre infrastructure from road construction.\n\nDevice availability and affordability\n\nThe 5G network cannot work on any mobile device. The first all-5G smartphones to come out in 2020 \u2013 Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S20 lineup \u2014 starting at $1,000.

In 2018, Ntel, a full 4G operator identified devices as the biggest problem to the adoption of the network. According to the operator, 4G is operated in over 4G sub-bands and there are fewer devices operating in the bands; and they are much more expensive.\n\nInstability in the FX market\n\nThe 5G operators in Nigeria would face a big cost hurdle while trying to navigate the foreign exchange market in Nigeria. The telecom industry in Nigeria depends heavily on foreign equipment manufacturers and imported technical expertise for the deployment and maintenance of networks.\n\nWhile the Nigerian government expects the 5G spectrum winners to deploy the technology within the first quarter of 2022, stakeholders in the industry say the major challenge is getting the offshore funding or accessing US dollar at a favourable exchange rate from Nigerian banks to import the needed equipment for 5G deployment.\n\nInadequate power supply\n\nThe electricity requirement for 5G technology is very high due to the need for more density coverage, more base stations, and additional equipment. According to a report entitled Operators facing power cost crunch by MTN Consulting, a 5G base station consumes four times more electricity than its 4G counterpart.\n\nCurrently, telcos spend on average 5 percent to 6 percent of their operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, on energy costs, according to MTN Consulting. And this is expected to rise with the shift to 5G.\n\nRead also: Mafab Communications, MTN face 4 hurdles ahead 5G deployment\n\nExact estimates differ by source, but MTN says the industry consensus is that 5G will double to triple energy consumption for mobile operators, once networks scale.\n\nInsecurity\n\nThe researchers at Advocaat pointed out the licence requirement for deployment in at least one state in the various geopolitical zones in Nigeria within stipulated timelines. However, the security challenges being experienced at the moment by many states in the Northern region of the country, which has led to the shutdown of telecom services in some areas over a long period, would pose a huge problem for the operators. Some stakeholders had told BusinessDay that their personnel no longer accept assignments to areas considered high-security risks in the country.\n\nRight of Way\n\nThe states across the country continue to charge high Right of Way fees despite an agreement secured by the Federal Government to reduce the charges to N140 per linear metre, the different RoW charges continue to be a disincentive for operators to deploy fibre infrastructure across the country.

          "title": "Five policy steps to fast-track 5G roll-out in Nigeria",
          "text": "Towards the concluding week of January, the Nigerian government launched the National Policy on 5G, which signifies its willingness to make the technology a reality in the country.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in his statement extolled the benefits of 5G, particularly in tackling the insecurity situation in the country. He instructed the security agencies to leverage the technology to address the problem in the country.\n\nWhile the President\u2019s enthusiasm for 5G may be a welcome development for operators, the reality of the commercialisation of 5G technology in Nigeria depends more on the policies enabling its deployment. Mere rhetorical postulation will not be enough to convince investors to deploy at speed, or that the economies of scale make sense, according to people knowledgeable in the industry.\n\nWith less than 18 months left of its tenure, President Buhari administration can fast-track these five policy steps to enable investors deploy quickly:\n\nWorkforce training\n\nOne of the biggest CAPEX for 5G operators is the scarcity of talent for the technology.\n\nThe two operators MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications are going to need a lot of human resources to be able to deploy at scale and it may be too much on their CAPEX to directly be involved in the training of the workforce.\n\nBeing a relatively new industry, the Nigerian government can invest in the training of the workforce for 5G technology by enlisting the universities and other post-tertiary institutions across the country to achieve this. The government can also fund training and retraining for workers to prepare for and meet 5G-related workforce needs.\n\nThe Industrial Training International (ITI) in a report suggests that this training and retraining can be done in conjunction with industry to ensure that it meets the required skill set. Policymakers, therefore, should make available incentives to the industry to support training.\n\nAvailability of spectrum in a timely manner\n\nMaking additional spectrum available in a timely and affordable fashion is very important for accelerating advanced network deployment, says the GSMA in a report.\n\nThis is how South Korea and the US were able to deploy the technology at a quicker rate. Korea, the frontrunner in the global 5G race, made 280 MHz of the 3.5 GHz and 2400 MHz bands available in 2018. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) developed a \u201c5G FAST\u201d plan to make auctioning high-band spectrum a priority.\n\nAuctions have already been concluded for the 28GHz and 24GHz bands, with the 37GHz, 39GHz, and 47GHz being auctioned at the time of writing this report. In Singapore, the IMDA plans to release licences for both 3.5GHz and mmWave spectrum together.\n\nThe GSMA also notes that there should be a balance among competing objectives, such as maximising proceeds from spectrum auctions, fostering competition to keep consumer prices low, and enabling the build-out of new mobile broadband infrastructure.\n\nAccess to site locations\n\nAlthough the President claims his administration was able to implement in 2019 the N145 fee agreement for Right of Way for fibre optic cables reached in 2013, the reality on the ground is different for all operators. The charges remain exorbitant in about 29 states.\n\nBesides, local authorities deny carriers access to locations until they have made certain unspecified payments. The government can specify spaces for the deployment of fibre and 5G equipment. For example, in Japan, operators can install 5G base stations on 208,000 traffic lights across the country. The Japanese government also proposed that the costs of using the traffic lights for 5G deployments be shared between operators and local administrations. In the same vein, the UK\u2019s Electronic Communications Code facilitates operators\u2019 access to macro and small cell infrastructure on public and private land.\n\nFinancial support for deployment\n\nWhile the Nigerian government is fixated on generating revenue from the sale of 5G licence, it should also realise that it has a financial obligation towards the deployment of the technology, especially if it wants to ensure ubiquitous access to connectivity. There should be a subsidy from the government for 5G deployment.\n\nMany investors including MTN, which has the widest reach, would be hard-put to deploy its 5G network to rural areas where it has little chance of making returns on investment. This is partly why 4G deployment in the country is still at 37 percent because it is very expensive to provide full service to every corner of the country.\n\nRead also: Rich countries embrace network sharing arrangements for speedy 5G rollout\n\nDue to the high cost of 5G equipment, operators in the UK had to agree with the government to build a shared rural network with financial contributions from both industry and government. In Shenzhen, the city administration offered CNY10,000 for every standalone 5G base station constructed, up to 15,000 base stations or a total of CNY150 million. They also offered electricity cost subsidies of up to three years for 5G sites.\n\nEase of sharing network agreements\n\nDue to the enormous CAPEX and OPEX burden of network deployment on operators, network sharing has become a strategy aimed at reducing the cost weight. And this is not limited to just the 5G network as operators have used this method for previous generations.\n\nAccording to Mckinsey, operators have been able to reduce the total cost of ownership by up to 30 percent while improving network quality through sharing a variety of both active and passive equipment. 5G will be no exception, with operators eyeing new ways of accelerating the deployment of an otherwise daunting investment.\n\nA prominent example of a network sharing agreement is the one between Orange Belgium and Proximus in July 2019. The operators said the agreement will improve coverage of the 5G network in Belgium with the combined number of mobile sites rising by 20 percent higher than the existing separate radio access network. The agreement would never have been possible without the flexibility exhibited by the Belgium government.\n\nAlso in 2019, Orange and Vodafone Spain entered into an active sharing agreement for mobile infrastructure on 14,800 masts and back-haul components, including joint use of 5G sites. The deal with Orange was expected to deliver cumulative OPEX and CAPEX savings to Vodafone of $667 million over a period of ten years.\n\nNew operators like Mafab may need to tap into shared agreements to reduce the cost, it is therefore important the government demonstrate flexibility in such transactions.\n\n\u201cIt is vital for the wider success of 5G that such cooperative agreements do not run into regulatory roadblocks. A growing number of regulators are taking steps to permit, or even encourage, shared deployment, especially for small cells, recognising that network operators need the flexibility to share infrastructure assets,\u201d the GSMA noted in its policy report.",

They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has disclosed that it is engaging the National Orientation Agency as well as regulators of public agencies to curb the activities of illegal financial operators.\n\nDirector General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda stated this in a goodwill message at the opening ceremony of a National Fact-Checking Course organized by the National Orientation Agency in Abuja, Tuesday.\n\nYuguda who was represented by the Executive Commissioner Corporate Services of the SEC, Mr. Ibrahim Boyi, stated that Nigeria\u2019s investment climate has continued to witness the proliferation of illegal Fund Managers, popularly referred to as Ponzi Schemes as the promoters of these Schemes continue to defraud millions of citizens, by promising them mind-boggling returns on investments.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSuch Schemes with all the illegality and promises of unrealistic returns have burnt the fortunes of many ambitious investors, from Yuan Dong Ponzi to Galaxy Transport, Famzhi Interbiz Limited, Cowlane and Durell, and the infamous Mavrodi Mundial Movement (MMM).\n\n\u201cThe upsurge of these Schemes has undermined the reputation of the capital market and dampened investors\u2019 confidence, among other things. This has created a considerable challenge to the growth of our market, and the Commission is striving to change the narrative by instilling a fair, transparent, and orderly market\u201d.\n\nYuguda said while the SEC, in collaboration with other regulators in the financial sector, strives to clamp down on merchants of fake news and Ponzi Schemes, investors also have a huge role to play.\n\n\u201cInvestors are advised to always confirm if the investment product, scheme, or company is registered with the SEC before investing. This could be done through our website: www.sec.gov.ng or via email to [email protected]; or from other regulatory authorities.\n\n\u201cInvestments enable growth in wealth, thus while encouraging more retail investments, we urge you to invest in investment classes and products approved by the SEC, which can be confirmed through the channels provided above, he stated.\n\nThe SEC DG described the course as a timely programme that would go a long way to check the scourge of fake news, misinformation, and disinformation.\n\nHe said disinformation, misinformation, and fake news are often intended to instigate hate, anger, and acrimony. Consequently, causing disaffection, division, violence, and even war.\n\n\u201cDisinformation in the media has long existed in different forms. However, modern fake news has attracted significant attention due to its prevalence and impact in the social media era.\n\n\u201cThe SEC, as the apex regulator of the Nigerian capital market recognizes the effect fake news can have on the market, as it can significantly impact prices in the capital market.\n\n\u201cNOA\u2019s drive to build detectors is therefore commendable. The capital market requires such fact-checkers to mitigate measures from fraudsters in the field of information-based securities fraud\u201d He stated.\n\nYuguda therefore assured of the Commission\u2019s continuous support, engagement, and collaboration towards bringing sustainable growth and development to our markets and the nation at large.\n\nIn his remarks, DG of NOA, Dr. Garba Abari expressed the need to expand the frontiers of the conversation around the issue of fake news which has become a matter of concern both in Nigeria and the world over.\n\nHe said it has become more imperative now especially with the elections approaching, which makes the training more compelling.\n\nAbari said the aim is to train 37,000 Nigerian fact checkers cutting across different spheres of national life; the military and security agencies, organized private sector, the public service at large, newspapers and online media practitioners, bloggers, and private citizens, that whatever knowledge applied within here is a knowledge that can be replicated at home through our family members and in our respective places of work.\n\n\u201cThe idea is first is to help the country before we enjoy all the freedom that we need. The social, conventional, and orthodox media have become an agent of propagating hate, mischief and creating an atmosphere that should not arise, thereby escalating our diversity, religious and different partisan preferences,\u201d he said.",

Anybody who was around in the state between 2004 and 2010 will know that Aregbesola was the harbinger of hope, confidence and power for the progressive party in the state.\n\n\u201cEverybody will agree that if not for Aregbesola\u2019s doggedness, modern politics and collective efforts, the PDP would have remained in power till date.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the 2018 governoship primary of the party, Adeoti said Aregbesola was blindfolded by his loyalty to his boss to accept, promote and assiduously work for a wrong and unpopular candidate.\n\nHe said: \u201cAregbesola was committed and loyal to his master in Lagos. That was why he supported an unpopular candidate in 2018. We all knew then that Oyetola was a bad product but Aregbesola did not have a choice. He obeyed his master.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, those people (Oyetola and his followers) have bit the finger that fed them. Aregbesola does not deserve being humiliated by anybody.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Minister of Interior, Aregbesola, said he had stomached betrayal, hypocrisy and backsliding from the people he was serving wholeheartedly.\n\nAccording to him, he decided to take a new path when he realised that the person he was committedly loyal to was out to destroy him and everything he stand for.\n\nHe urged members of the party to vote for Adeoti in the coming Saturday governoship primary of the party.\n\nLeaders of the APC who included former speaker of Osun House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Najeem Salaam and Chairman of the party in the state, Hon. Rasak Salinsile, who were at the event urged members of the party to ensure that Adeoti emerge victorious in the primary.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMet, has predicted normal annual rainfall in its seasonal rainfall prediction for 2022.\n\nMaking the presentation in Abuja yesterday, the minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika said the prediction indicates that the annual rainfall amount is expected to be normal in most parts of the country.\n\nThis is even as the director-general, NiMet Prof. Mansur Matazu said: \u201cthe challenges of variability in climate viz a viz global warming which has in recent times given rise to high rainfall amounts occurring within a short duration has made flash flood episodes more frequent. Several roads were decimated in 2021, among which are the Maiwa bridge, along Bauchi \u2013 Kano highway, Ningi local government area of\n\nBauchi state, the single day rainfall event of 16th July 2021 over Lagos metropolis which flooded a large portion of Lagos Island including the\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\npopular Balogun market. Increased severity of dry spells episodes in parts of Jigawa, Bauchi, Yobe, Gombe and Nasarawa states.\n\n\u201cWith such recurring extreme events, the seasonal climate prediction becomes a veritable tool to notify relevant stakeholders and emergency managers of the anticipated rainfall pattern within the season for necessary mitigation plans.\u201d\n\nAlso, parts of the minister\u2019s speech read that \u201cfor the annual total rainfall, the prediction indicates that the annual rainfall amount is expected to be normal in most parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe annual rainfall amount is expected to range from 390 mm in the North to over 2790 mm in the South. Annual rainfall amount ranging from 390 mm to 790 mm is anticipated in some parts of Borno, Yobe, Jigawa, Katsina and Sokoto states. The central states such as Nasarawa, Taraba, Kogi, Benue and the FCT, as well as Ekiti, Osun and Oyo are anticipated to record 1190 mm to 1590 mm of total rainfall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister further said the seasonal rainfall prediction also revealed that \u201cfrom May to August, 2022 dry spells of different degrees of severity ranging from mild to severe, are predicted for different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cModerate dry spell persisting for up to 15 days is predicted over parts of Adamawa, Benue, Kogi, Ekiti, Kwara, Niger, FCT, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Gombe. Parts of Kebbi, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, Borno, Nasarawa and Plateau states may experience a severe dry spell that could persist for up to 20 days or longer in June 2022.\u201d\n\nThe highlights of the prediction showed that \u201cthe earliest onset of the planting season (beginning of planting activities) is expected about February 28, 2022 in the coastal parts of the country while the onset of rainfall is expected to occur between April and May in the central states, and eventually within June to July in the Northern states.\n\n\u201cThe onset of the planting season is predicted to be normal over most parts of Nigeria with a few areas having it earlier while some areas having it delayed\n\n\u201cRainfall cessation dates across most parts of the county in 2022 is predicted to be near the long-term average conditions. The window between the Onset and cessation dates can be regarded as safe periods for the planting of various crops in accordance with their cropping calendars. The growing season is predicted to last between 250-300 days in Southern parts of the country, and 100 to 200 days in the North. Noteworthy, are areas around Kwara, Oyo, Lagos, Nasarawa, Benue, Bayelsa, and Rivers which are likely to experience shorter than normal length of growing season. However, prolonged length of growing season is anticipated in parts of Plateau, Kaduna, Edo, and Imo States\u201d.",

He declared that his appraisal of the two years of the present administration was an honest, genuine and intellectual analysis of governance in Bayelsa State.\n\nSylva, in a statement issued by his special assistant on media and public affairs, Julius Bukoro, said his comments on the state radio interview was straightforward and the highpoints was based on high and low points of the present administration in the state.\n\nThe minister\u2019s statement was a response to the criticism in a piece written by the state commissioner for information and strategy, Hon Ayibaina Duba.\n\nHe said despite the fact that he harped on some of the brighter sides of the current administration in the state, his comment on the administration of Governor Douye Diri was far from a caustic, combative one but honest, intellectual analysis of Bayelsa State and genuine appraisal of his home state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBukoro said, \u201cThe minister\u2019s chief concern was that this administration has not fully weaned itself off the previous one which was a complete circus, though Diri is significantly more human compared to his predecessor. As a Bayelsan, a former governor, a major stakeholder of the state, Sylva has the right, like everyone else, to comment, analyse and proffer solutions to aspects of governance in the state that can be improved upon\u201d.\n\nHe said the interview was an act of patriotism and critical appraisal hence the avalanche of applause from all parts of the state and beyond, adding that the development of Bayelsa State is a continuum. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t begin and end with one individual, any single government or a group of people. It is a journey that will require every single Bayelsan, every day of his/her life to work towards that very divine project. Serving Nigeria through the Federal Government is not a license to ignore one\u2019s home state.\n\n\u201cSylva will keep on working for the development of Bayelsa State in any capacity he finds himself, as Minister, through the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, inspired and partnered with Rungas Prime Industries Limited to establish a 1,000,000 per annum Type 3 LPG composite Cylinder Manufacturing plant in Polaku, Bayelsa State. Sylva also sited an infectious Disease Hospital in the state through the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and one of its agency, the NNPC.\n\n\u201cThere was the Signing of the Final Investment Decision (FID) on a gas processing and methanol plant project by Brass Fertilizer and Petro-Chemical Company which will create 30,000 jobs. Commencement of the Oil and Gas Museum at Oloibiri, Ogbia LGA and commissioning, along with President Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian Content Tower which vastly improved the aesthetics of Yenagoa and also created jobs. So, national service does not collide with service for one\u2019s home state. There will be more of such interviews and more acts of patriotism and critical appraisal from Sylva,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

This is because the Governor has etched his name in the sands of time with his leadership qualities and managerial know-how.\n\n\u201cConsidering that there is presently no individual among the array of aspirants to the office of the Executive Governor of the State of Osun that can match the credential of the incumbent Governor in experience and personality, and the need for continuity of people-oriented projects and lofty programmes embarked upon by his administration, hence, the need for us to adopt and endorse him as our candidate in the forthcoming governorship election.\u201d",

          "text": "New details have surfaced about how informants alerted suspended DCP Abba Kyari and his crew about the 25kg of cocaine from Brazil, and how greed revealed the criminal deal.\n\nNegotiations between the informants and Kyari and his crew had broken down.\n\nThe informants who uncovered the drug gang were unable to agree on a 60:40 split of the drug proceeds, with 60 percent going to Kyari and his boys and 40 percent going to the informants.\n\nHowever, the informants insisted on a 50:50 split. The failure to reach an agreement exposes the entire scheme.\n\nOne kilogram of cocaine is worth N7 million on the street, while a 25kg bag is worth N175 million.\n\nIf the informants agreed to Kyari\u2019s 60:40 split, the Deputy Commissioner of Police and his team would have received N105 million, while the informants would have received N70 million.\n\nHowever, a 50:50 split means that each party will receive N87.5 million.\n\nIt was expected that Kyari and his colleagues would sell. He later sold 5kg and delivered $61,400 to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency\u2019s undercover commander (NDLEA).\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, the NDLEA\u2019s Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, disagreed with the Police that NDLEA officers at the Enugu International Airport provided cover and approval for the drug traffickers.\n\nThe NDLEA stated that it sees no need to protect anyone who may be charged in connection with the ongoing investigation into the 25kg cocaine sale.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTo correct some inaccuracies in the information in the public space that NDLEA officers at the Enugu airport were the ones who received from the cartel details about the mule coming from Addis Ababa, the Agency wishes to quote from the transcript of Abba Kyari\u2019s recorded conversation with our undercover officer and a portion of ASP James Bawa\u2019s statement to the police as documented in the police investigation report, a copy of which was made available to the Agency, to state that it\u2019s an established fact that it\u2019s the Abba Kyari\u2019s team that was contacted by the cartel and without doubt the records clearly show how their ring works.\u201d\n\nShortly after the NDLEA declared Kyari wanted, Babafemi said, the police questioned him and others, after which they were handed over along with the report of their interrogation.\n\nAccording to the police investigation report, ASP James Bawa in his statement to the police reveals that \u201che was called by an informant identified as IK from Brazil who told him that a drug courier will be arriving on board Ethiopian Airlines in Enugu.\n\n\u201cHe explained further that a pointer from IK, the Brazil-based informant met with him at about 1420hrs on 19th January 2022 outside the airport and showed him a picture of the courier. Subsequently, they sighted the suspect as he exited the airport terminal after all arrival clearance formalities, and he was arrested with another associate.\u201d\n\nThe embattled Abba Kyari, according to NDLEA, also shed light on the process in his recorded conversation with the undercover anti-drug officer. He said: \u201cThey are greedy, seriously greedy (referring to his informants), we tried to have them accept 40% but they refused, except 50%. They know the rudiment of the deal very well; they are the ones that do the packing. From Brazil, one of the informants accompanied it to Ethiopia. You understand; one of the informants accompanied the goods to Ethiopia, one of the informants that give us information. He is the boy of the big baron.\n\n\u201cAddis, from Addis it will be given to those to proceed further with it, he will get their snapshots without their knowledge. Yes, he will reveal those that are conveying it further, get snapshots of theirs without their knowledge and send to us (Abba Kyari\u2019s team). So we already know the goods, picture and the cloths they are wearing, hope you understand, we know your name, he will give us everything. So, automatically my team will just be waiting, they will just see you and arrest you.\u201d\n\nResponding to NDLEA\u2019s question on whether his boys are usually stationed inside or outside the airport, Abba Kyari reportedly said: \u201cYes, yes, some are outside while some are inside. They will just allow you to finish arrival formalities and arrest you the moment you come out.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman said \u201cthe above no doubt establishes who the cartel was relating with and their modus operandi. Again, this is to correct inaccuracies in some reports and assure that the Agency will not deviate from an evidence-based investigation that will spare nobody found complicit.\u201d",

          "title": "INEC to resolve BVAS challenges before Ekiti, Osun polls \u2013 Yakubu",
          "text": "Ahead of the June 18 and July 16, 2022 Ekiti and Osun governorship elections respectively, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said in order to provide more eligible voters with the opportunity to register, it is considering the devolution of the exercise nationwide beyond its state and local government offices.\n\nYakubu also said party primaries for the Osun governorship election would begin today 16th February and end on 12th March 2022 while that of Ekiti was concluded 29th January 2022.\n\nProf Yakubu also said the commission \u201cdecided to devolve the CVR exercise to ward level in both Ekiti and Osun states to enable more citizens register.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) Tuesday in Abuja, Prof Yakubu stated that the devolution of the CVR exercise to other designated centres was one of the major issues for discussion at the meeting.\n\n\u201cIn view of the forthcoming elections, the Commission has decided to devolve the CVR exercise to Ward level in both Ekiti and Osun States to enable more citizens register.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, in order to provide more eligible voters with the opportunity to register, the Commission is considering the devolution of the exercise nationwide beyond our state and local government offices where the registration currently takes place. The devolution of the CVR exercise to other designated centres is one of the major issues for discussion at this meeting.\u201d\n\nHe reminded the RECs that the commission was preparing to conduct bye-elections in four states of the federation to fill six vacancies in the House of Representatives and some State Houses of Assembly.\n\nOther issue of discussion at the meeting, according to INEC chairman, was \u201cthe balanced distribution of voters to polling units nationwide. Last year, the commission achieved the historic feat of expanding voter access to polling units nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to decongest the densely populated polling units by converting the erstwhile Voting Points (VPs) and Voting Point Settlements (VPS) to polling units and relocating some of them to unserved and underserved areas to make it easier for voters on election day.\n\n\u201cWhile this lofty goal has been achieved in many states, there are still congested polling units and other polling units with between 0 and 50 voters as we saw in some of the recent elections.\u201d\n\nAs a solution, Yakubu said, \u201cover the next few weeks, the commission will intensify efforts to address the issue ahead of the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun governorship elections and ultimately the 2023 General Election. Finding a solution to this issue is one of the reasons for convening this meeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn election day administration, the commission has over the years made giant strides in improving electoral logistics, staff recruitment, training, deployment and the introduction of technology for voter verification and authentication.\n\n\u201cThe creation of Registration Area Centres (RACs) improved the early opening of polls. The benefits of these new innovations to the electoral process and the credibility of our elections have been enormous.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of elections conducted since the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) in the Isoko South I State Constituency bye-election, followed by the Anambra state governorship election and most recently in the FCT Area Council election has been positively adjudged by observers as credible.\n\n\u201cHowever, the challenges to the optimal functionality of the device are acknowledged and we are working on them.\n\n\u201cWhen the commission introduced the BVAS last year, the compact device was intended to achieve two objectives. First is the verification of the genuineness of the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) and the fingerprint or facial authentication of voters during accreditation.\n\n\u201cSecondly, to replace the Z-pad for uploading the polling unit results to the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV) in real-time on Election Day. So far, the BVAS has performed optimally in verifying the authenticity of PVCs and uploading images of Polling Unit results to the IReV.\n\n\u201cWe will review and improve its functionality for biometric accreditation of voters in the forthcoming bye-elections and off-season Governorship elections before the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cThe commission remains convinced that the deployment of technology in our elections safeguards the integrity of the vote and provides a better guarantee for electoral credibility than the best manual process.

          "text": "The lingering scarcity of the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol in parts of the country bites harder Tuesday as Nigerians now pay between N600 and N700 for a litre of fuel.\n\nWorst hit are residents of Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city and Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital.\n\nAdulterated fuel\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority had last week, said it found gasoline with methanol above national specifications in the supply chain and withdrew the fuel from circulation.\n\nAccording to the regulator, the product was being cleared as the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including loaded trucks in transit.\n\nConsequent upon this, President Muhammdu Buhari directed appropriate authorities to sanction all those involved in the importation of the adulterated product.\n\nAlthough there had been assurances from the Nigeria National Petroleum Company(NNPC) that the situation would subside, but there was nothing to suggest this would be ending so soon.\n\nEffect on commuters\n\nThe development has left some commuters, especially workers in both public and private sectors stranded, with some paying huge transport in over 100 percent to get to their destinations.\n\nWhile the black marketers lined up major roads selling the commodity undisturbed, commercial drivers also took turns to taunt and heap heavy transport fares on helpless commuters.\n\nA visit to airport road, Lugbe, revealed that the hawkers, some of whom were teenagers, brazenly displayed 10-litre gallon of fuel with a high price tag ranging from between N5, 000 and N7000.\n\nAlso, it was gathered that some filling stations sell between N190 and N195 per litre.\n\nOne of them who interacted with Blueprint in Hausa language under anonymity said: \u201cWe are selling what we buy and there is nothing we can do about it. This (10 litres) is N6,000, but you can give me N5,000.\u201d\n\nWhile our reporter considered the amount high, he drove further towards the City Gate where the sellers gave N7,000 and N7,500 as the price for same quantity.\n\nA female university teacher who simply gave her name as Sandra lamented the plight of Nigerians since the fuel scarcity returned.\n\nShe said: \u201cI just asked them and they gave me a price that really scared me. Buying a 10-litre worth of fuel at between N6, 000 and N7,000 to do what? Where are we really headed? We must not continue this way till weekend, otherwise there would be crisis. I just hope this is not a design by some people to further make a case for an increase in the price of the commodity.\n\n\u201cI would rather go and park the vehicle home and go to work at an exorbitant price. This calls for serious emergency, especially at this critical time in the life of the nation. If you ask me, I will simply say workers, in both the private and public sectors, should be allowed to work from home. I hope government is aware this development can further aggravate the already bad security situation in the country.\u201d\n\nBlueprint also observed long queues of over two kilometres along a few filling stations dispensing fuel at the time of this report.\n\nA commercial motorist who gave his name as Michael at Conoil along the airport road lamented the situation, saying he had spent virtually all the day on queue waiting to take his turn at the filling station.\n\n\u201cHelp us talk to the government; this is just the least service we can ask of them. Why should getting fuel to buy with your money be a major problem again? I have been on this queue for over 5 hours and there is no hope of me getting fuel. We can\u2019t continue this way as a nation aspiring to prosper. Is it not even disturbing that Buhari (President Muhammadu) is off to Ethiopia at a time we are suffering here?\n\nAlso, at the phase 2 junction in Jikwoyi, a suburb of the FCT, it was total chaos as hundreds of commuters struggled to board the few vehicles available to pick them at a huge fare.\n\nFor instance, some of the drivers were seen shouting on top of their voices, asking those they can\u2019t afford it to step out without taking any plea.\n\nAt Shafa filling station at CBN junction in Karu, the only filling station that had fuel in Jikwoyi, it was a \u2018warfront\u2019 of sort as motorists, Okada (commercial motorcycle operators) riders and black market operators battled to buy fuel.\n\nIn an interview, Ejike, one of the Okada riders, said he was at the filling station as early as 6am, and was still there as at 11.00am when Blueprint visited.\n\nEjike, who spoke in Pidgin English, said the 5 hours lost at the filling station would have yielded some dividends for him.\n\nAlso, a motorist who carved anonymity said: \u201cI have been roaming about since past 6am, and now (2:15pm), I have finally gotten fuel at a very exorbitant price.\u201d\n\nHe told this reporter that he had to finally resort to patronising black market operators after going from one filling station to another without success.\n\nAnd just beside the filling station, \u2018black marketers\u2019 were having a field day as they were swarmed by willing motorists who opted to buy at a very high price.\n\nIn an interview, a black market operator, Ameh, said the situation was not easy for both the black market operators and people buying from the filling stations.\n\nAccording to him, he bought the fuel at very high price and he is left with no choice than to sell at a price that he could make some profits.\n\nWhen asked why the price per litre suddenly went from N500 to N700 in just 3 hours, Ameh explained that, \u201cthis morning I sold N500 per litre and later when I went to buy, the filling station sold to me at N300 per litre and before they agreed to sell for me in my 25 litres gallon, I had to bribe them with N1, 500. So you see why we now sell for N700?\n\nCommuters\u2019 pain\n\nFor many, it was a harrowing experience as John Musa recounts: \u201cI paid N500 for Okada from Jikwoyi to Nyanya and N400 to Berger. I didn\u2019t have a choice because there were so many people and there were no vehicles.\u201d\n\nBefore the fuel scarcity, commuters paid N200 from Jikwoyi to Nyanya for Okada while N200 was spent to get to Berger from Nyanya.\n\nAn attendant at Mobil filling station opposite Living Faith Church in Jikwoyi, told Blueprint that they were expecting two trucks of petrol tomorrow (Wednesday).\n\nWhen pressed further for the particular time, he simply said, \u201canytime we see the tanker, we will start selling after offloading.\u201d\n\nCalls to the GSM lines of NNPC spokesman, Garba Deen Mohammed, did not yield result as the numbers were said to be switched off.\n\nLagos\n\nAnd from Lagos, commuters accused commercial drivers of being wicked for hiking transport fares.\n\nOne of them, Oluwole Kadiri, a civil servant, said, \u201cmore than any other thing, these drivers have further aggravated the crisis occasioned by the fuel scarcity. They are so much obsessed with making a fortune of an already bad situation. They lack human face in all they are doing, their major concern is increasing their daily take home. This is not the best way to treat ourselves in moment of crisis. we don\u2019t have to be heartless to make it in life.\u201d\n\nAt the Victoria Island, Lagos Island as well as some parts of Mailnland, it was observed that some filling stations chose to select whom they wanted to dispense fuel to.\n\nThe huge presence of commercial motorbike operators and Keke Marwa would not bother them.\n\nConsequently, the development led to a heavy gridlock which further led to sharp increase in transport fare.\n\nAnd like Abuja, it was time for \u2018cool business\u2019 for the black marketers who delightedly put a heavy price tag on the commodity.\n\nIn a reaction to the development, a private sector worker, Saeed Sulaiman, said government should direct that \u201cworkers in both the private and public sectors should work from home pending when the self-imposed scarcity will be over. I am just beginning to imagine why it has become difficult for the government to fix the situation. It is high time we sat back as a nation to ask ourselves if we really want to progress. It is just pathetic that we like making life unbearable for ourselves whenever anything such as fuel scarcity happens.\u201d\n\nN2.557trn subsidy fund\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has lashed at the federal lawmakers for inserting N887.99billion worth of projects into the N17.126trillion 2022 budget.\n\nHe consequently ordered them to remove the inserted projects for usage of the N887.99billion as originally proposed.\n\nBuhari who made the request Tuesday through separate letters written to the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives , Hon Femi Gbajabiamila , proposed N2.557trillion as additional fund for fuel subsidy in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nThe letter reads in part : \u201cAs I indicated at the signing of the 2022 Appropriation Act, I forward herewith the Proposals for amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act (as detailed in Schedules I-V), for the kind consideration and approval by the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature. It is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totaling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision (see Schedule l).\n\n\u201cI urge you to roll back some of the N887.99 billion of projects earlier inserted in the budget by the National Assembly to accommodate these amendments.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is necessary to reinstate the four (4) capital projects totaling N1.42 billion in the Executive Proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources that were removed in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cThe Appropriation Amendment request is for a total sum of N106,161,499,052 (One hundred and six billion, one hundred and sixty-one million, four hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and fifty-two Naira only) for Capital Expenditures and N43,870,592,044 (Forty-three billion, eight hundred and seventy million, five hundred and ninety-two thousand, and forty-four Naira only) for Recurrent Expenditures. I therefore request the National Assembly to make the above amendments without increasing the budget deficit.\n\n\u201cHowever, following the suspension of the PMS subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy (see Schedule V). An additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation ACCOunt (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.00 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion. Therefore, the amount available to fund the FGN Budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\n\n\u201cAggregate expenditure is projected to increase by N45.85 billion, due to additional domestic debt service provision of N102.5 billion net of the reductions in Statutory Transfers by N56.67 billion, as follows: NDDC, by N12.61 billion from N102.78 billion to N90.18 billion; NEDC, by N5.90 bilion from N48.08 billion to N42.18 billion; UBEC, by N19.08 billion from N112.29 billion to N93.21 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, byN 9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion; and NASENI, by N9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion.\n\n\u201cTotal budget deficit is projected to increase by N1.01 trillion to N7.40 trillion, representing 4.01% of GDP. The incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding Local Contractors\u2019 Debts and Other Liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth (see Schedule I).\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative to reinstate the N22.0 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed (see Schedule II).\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital project replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act; 139 out of the 254 such projects totaling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget\u201d.\n\nBeing a letter read before the start of plenary , there was no room for comments from any of the senators .",

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has shared details of how drug mules contacted a suspended police officer, Abba Kyari\u2019s team.\n\nThe details were revealed in a statement by the NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi on Wednesday, days after the 25kg cocaine deal involving Kyari made headlines.\n\n\u201cTo correct some inaccuracies in the information in the public space that NDLEA officers at the Enugu Airport were the ones who received from the cartel details about the mule coming from Addis Ababa, the agency wishes to quote from the transcript of Abba Kyari\u2019s recorded conversation with our undercover officer and a portion of ASP James Bawa\u2019s statement to the police as documented in the police investigation report, a copy of which was made available to the agency, to state that it\u2019s an established fact that it\u2019s the Abba Kyari\u2019s team that was contacted by the cartel and without doubt, the records clearly show how their ring works.\n\n\u201cRecall that after NDLEA requested for Kyari and others for interrogation, they were questioned by the police, after which they were handed over along with the report of their interrogation,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cAccording to the police investigation report, ASP James Bawa in his statement to the police reveals that \u2018he was called by an informant identified as IK from Brazil who told him that a drug courier will be arriving on board Ethiopian Airlines in Enugu.\n\n\u201cHe explained further that a pointer from IK, the Brazil-based informant met with him at about 1420hrs on 19th January 2022 outside the airport and showed him a picture of the courier. Subsequently, they sighted the suspect as he exited the airport terminal after all arrival clearance formalities, and he was arrested with another associate.'\u201d\n\nRead Also: Police Arrest Abba Kyari, Four Other Officers\n\nIt added: \u201cIn his own recorded conversation with our undercover officer, Abba Kyari also said the following: \u2018They are greedy, seriously greedy (referring to his informants), we tried to have them accept 40% but they refused, except 50%, they know the rudiment of the deal very well, they are the ones that do the packing.\n\n\u201cFrom Brazil, one of the informants accompanied it to Ethiopia. You understand; one of the informants accompanied the goods to Ethiopia, one of the informants that give us information. He is the boy of the big baron.\n\n\u201cFrom Addis, it will be given to those to proceed further with it, he will get their snapshots without their knowledge. Yes, he will reveal those that are conveying it further, get snapshots of theirs without their knowledge and send them to us (Abba Kyari\u2019s team). So, we already know the goods, pictures and the clothes they are wearing, hope you understand, we know your name, he will give us everything. So, automatically my team will just be waiting, they will just see you and arrest you.\u201d\n\n\u201cResponding to our officer\u2019s question on whether his boys are usually stationed inside or outside the airport, Abba Kyari said, \u201cYes, yes, some are outside while some are inside. They will just allow you to finish arrival formalities and arrest you the moment you come out,\u201d the NDLEA\u2019s statement read.\n\nIn his summation, Mr Babafemi asserted that the narrative leaves no doubt and emphatically establishes who the cartel was relating to and their modus operandi.\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman assured that the agency will not deviate from an evidence-based investigation that will spare nobody found complicit.",

          "text": "The father of the late Dowen College Student, Sylvester Oromoni (Snr) has testified at the coroner\u2019s inquest about the circumstances surrounding his son\u2019s controversial death, alleging a massive cover-up.\n\nOromoni made the allegation on Tuesday while answering questions under cross-examination from the counsel to the Lagos State Government, Mr Akin George, in the investigations to unravel the cause of death.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a lot of videos on social media and you said eloquently that there is a massive cover-up in this case. Who are those who cover-up, when and how?\u201d the lawyer asked.\n\nIn response, Oromoni said: \u201cThere is a massive cover-up and it is clearly stated in the police report. A Magistrates\u2019 Court in Yaba remanded five students of Dowen College for 21 days but after 14 days, the boys were granted bail when the police were not done with their investigations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Suspected ISWAP Fighters\u2019 Landmine Kills Six Locals In Borno\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the (former) Commissioner of Police (Hakeem Odumosu), he told me that it was not true the court granted them bail as the police was not done with their investigation.\n\n\u201cHe said that on the day they released those boys, the courts were not even sitting. I then called the Deputy Commissioner of Police. He told me the same thing and told me to give him some time.\u201d\n\nOromoni further testified that when Odumosu called him back, he confirmed that the boys had been released by the court. But he said it came as a surprise to him because they were given 21 days for their investigations and the boys spent just 14 days in detention.\n\n\u201cThey (police) said they were going to write a protest letter. They were already interrogating two of the students so they were taken by surprise,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThe same Commissioner of Police, after some days now publicly said that at the instance of Mr Governor, the Attorney-General and the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) that there was nothing wrong with the boys, therefore, they\u2019ve released them.\u201d\n\nThe counsel then asked him if he knows the processes involved in the administration of justice regarding children.\n\nOromoni replied in the negative.\n\nThe witness was also asked questions about the several videos of the late Sylvester which have been made public and which showed the pains he suffered.\n\nWhen asked why there was no video made of the boy\u2019s dying declaration detailing the names of the students he alleged beat him and forced him to drink a substance, Oromoni said the videos in the public were not made in anticipation of his death but that the deceased\u2019s mother made it to show what the boy went through and ultimately to give testimony and thanksgiving in church.\n\nWhen the videos were played in court, Oromoni broke down in tears and the coroner, Magistrate Mikhail Kadiri had to stand down proceedings at two different times to enable him to regain his composure to continue his testimony.\n\nMost of the videos have been admitted as evidence before the court.\n\nUnder cross-examination from Godwin Omoaka (SAN), counsel to one of the suspected Dowen Students, Oromoni also testified that he was not present when his son disclosed that he was given a substance to drink.\n\n\u201cYou do not know as a matter of fact, if he actually told Peter Odewo-Oritse (the second witness) that he was beaten and given a poisonous substance,\u201d the lawyer asked\n\n\u201cI believe the story. I know that Peter doesn\u2019t lie. The school has more than 500 people. The boy mentioned just these people. Peter wasn\u2019t the only one he told. He also told my wife\u201d, Oromoni replied.\n\nMeanwhile, the coroner has condemned some social media reports of the proceedings. He encouraged the media to be accurate in its reportage and reiterated his determination to unravel what actually transpired in the case.\n\nHe also indicated that the court would call as witnesses, the late Sylvester\u2019s roommates, the Dowen College school nurse who attended to him, the students who allegedly played football with the deceased, the investigative police officers, the pathologist in Warri, Dr. Clement Vhriterhire and a Lagos based consultant pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa to assist the court in its fact-finding.",

          "text": "Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva, who has been at the center of a doping scandal throughout the Beijing Olympics, had three substances used to treat heart conditions in her sample, according to a document that was filed in her arbitration hearing.\n\nThe document, which was released by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and viewed by The New York Times and CNN, said that Valieva tested positive not only for the banned drug trimetazidine but also for Hypoxen and L-carnitine, which are not blacklisted.\n\nValieva\u2019s defense team claimed that the teen skating star may have accidentally ingested traces of trimetazidine by sharing a drinking glass with her grandfather, who takes the heart medication. The drug, commonly used to treat angina, has been prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency since 2014 for its potential to enhance blood flow and aid endurance.\n\nThe Russian manufacturer of Hypoxen says the product increases endurance and reduces fatigue during physical activity by promoting more efficient oxygen use.\n\nL-carnitine is an amino acid taken as a dietary supplement that may also increase blood flow and oxygen supply to muscles. It is not prohibited on its own, but infusions of high doses are not allowed. In 2019, the US Anti-Doping Agency suspended track coach Alberto Salazar for four years \u2014 later extended to a lifetime ban \u2014 for improperly using substances including L-carnitine.\n\nThe head of the USADA, Travis Tygart, told CNN that the presence of the three drugs in Valieva\u2019s system \u201cappears to be the case of a pretty deliberate attempt to use substances in order to enhance performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s using the three that showed the intent of trying three different routes that ultimately give the same impact on performance: increased endurance, reduced shortness of breath, tiredness,\u201d Tygart said.\n\nHowever, he added that he didn\u2019t believe the 15-year-old athlete would have had the knowledge or resources to coordinate such a scheme on her own.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency has announced that it is investigating the entourage surrounding Valieva. The agency\u2019s chief, Witold Banka, tweeted Tuesday that the doping of minors is \u201cevil and unforgivable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors, coaches and support personnel who are found to have provided performance-enhancing drugs to minors should be banned for life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also think that they should be in prison.\u201d\n\nThe Russian star was cleared by arbitrators on Monday to compete in the Olympics despite the positive test, which was returned last week from a sample taken in December.\n\nThe panel rejected appeals by WADA, the International Olympic Committee and the International Skating Union to reinstate a suspension that was originally levied but then removed by Russian anti-doping authorities.\n\nValieva finished as the top qualifier in the women\u2019s singles short program on Tuesday, and remains the overwhelming favorite to win the event after the free skate on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the IOC has announced that no medals will be distributed to any athletes if Valieva reaches the podium. The medal ceremony from last week\u2019s team figure skating competition, which the Russian squad won behind the teen phenom\u2019s dominant performances, are also on hold until the full anti-doping investigation is completed.",

U.S. consumer price inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.5% in January, while inflation in the euro zone was 5.1%, the highest since the European single currency\u2019s creation.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes sometimes volatile prices for energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 4.4% in January from 4.2% in December, its highest since these records began in 1997.\n\nRetail price inflation \u2013 a longer-running series which the ONS says is no longer accurate, but which is used in commercial contracts and to set interest payments for some government bonds \u2013 was the highest since March 1991 in January at 7.8%.\n\nWednesday\u2019s data showed further inflation pressure ahead as manufacturers increased their prices by 9.9% from January last year, the biggest annual jump since September 2008 and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll.\n\nExcluding volatile products such as food, tobacco and petroleum products, the 9.3% increase was the biggest since annual comparisons began in 1997.\n\nBut the prices of factory inputs rose slightly less quickly, showing an increase of 13.6%, down from 13.8% in December and a peak of more than 15% in November.",

          "title": "Ukraine Tensions: West Skeptical of Russian Overtures",
          "text": "Russia made two overtures to ease tensions around Ukraine \u2014 reporting a pullback of troops near its neighbor and welcoming talks with the West. But the United States and its allies said they needed evidence of the troop movements and that the threat of a Russian invasion still loomed.\n\nconflict\n\nFor the second day Tuesday, there were signs of hope that Europe might avoid war following weeks of escalating East-West tensions as Moscow massed around 150,000 troops on three sides of Ukraine and held massive military drills. Those moves led to dire warnings from Washington, London and other European capitals that Russia was preparing to roll into Ukraine.\n\nBut the tenor changed this week. President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Russia does not want war and would rely on negotiations in its efforts to eliminate any chance that Ukraine could one day join NATO \u2014 his key demand in the crisis. At the same time, he did not commit to a full pullback, saying Russia\u2019s next moves in the standoff will depend on how the situation evolves.\n\nRussia also offered few details of the pullback, and President Joe Biden said American officials had not verified Russia\u2019s claim. He promised that the U.S. would give diplomacy \u201cevery chance,\u201d but he struck a skeptical tone about Moscow\u2019s intentions.\n\n\u201cTwo paths are still open,\u201d Biden said in remarks at the White House. \u201cBut let there be no doubt: If Russia commits this breach by invading Ukraine, responsible nations around the world will not hesitate to respond. If we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we\u2019ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow.\u201d\n\nUkrainian leaders have repeatedly sought to project calm but also strength during the crisis. In an apparent show of defiance, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared that Wednesday would be a \u201cday of national unity,\u201d calling on citizens to display the blue-and-yellow flag and sing the national anthem in the face of \u201chybrid threats.\u201d\n\nEven amid the glimmers of hope, Biden said 150,000 Russian forces are now massed near Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus \u2014 an increase from an earlier U.S. estimate of 130,000 troops.\n\nRussia\u2019s claim that it pulled back troops \u201cwould be good, but we have not yet verified that,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIndeed, our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position.\u201d\n\nRussia has denied having any invasion plans. It wants the West to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet nations out of NATO, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders and roll back forces from Eastern Europe.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have roundly rejected those demands, but they offered to engage in talks with Russia on ways to bolster security in Europe.\n\nSpeaking after meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin said the West agreed to discuss a ban on missile deployment to Europe, restrictions on military drills and other confidence-building measures \u2014 issues that Moscow put on the table years ago.\n\nHe said Russia is open to discuss \u201csome of those elements,\u201d but added that it would do so only in combination \u201cwith the main issues that are of primary importance for us.\u201d\n\nWhile Scholz reiterated that NATO\u2019s eastward expansion \u201cis not on the agenda \u2014 everyone knows that very well,\u201d Putin retorted that Moscow will not be assuaged by such assurances.\n\n\u201cThey are telling us it won\u2019t happen tomorrow,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWell, when will it happen? The day after tomorrow? What does it change for us in the historic perspective? Nothing.\u201d\n\nScholz also said diplomatic options are \u201cfar from exhausted,\u201d and he praised the announcement of a troop withdrawal as a \u201cgood signal,\u201d adding: \u201cWe hope that more will follow.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry released images of tanks and howitzers rolling onto railway platforms and more tanks rolling across snowy fields. It did not disclose where or when the images were taken, or where the vehicles were headed, other than \u201cto places of permanent deployment.\u201d\n\nUkraine expressed skepticism.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t believe when we hear, we\u2019ll believe when we see,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.\n\nAnd NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that there have been no signs, so far, of a reduced military presence on Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of cyberattacks knocked out the websites of the Ukrainian army, the defense ministry and major banks. There was no indication that the relatively low-level denial-of-service attacks might be a smoke screen for more serious cyber mischief. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. has not yet determined who was behind the attacks.\n\nDespite the worst East-West tensions in decades, few Russians expect a war. In a village in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Ukraine\u2019s border, residents carried on with life as usual, even as more military personnel have been passing through village streets.\n\n\u201cWe are really on the border, we really have relatives here and there, everyone has somebody\u201d on the Ukrainian side, villager Lyudmila Nechvolod said. \u201cNo one wants war.\u201d\n\nRussian lawmakers urged Putin to recognize rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine as independent states. The State Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house, voted to submit an appeal to Putin to that effect.\n\nPutin said the request reflects the Russian public\u2019s sympathy for the suffering of people trapped in the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed over 14,000 since 2014. He noted, however, that Russia continues to believe a 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany should serve as the main vehicle for a settlement of the separatist conflict.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has mandated its Committee on Petroleum Downstream to include in their investigation, the lingering issue of fuel scarcity.\n\nThis, the lawmakers stated was to ascertain if there was an interim report on the claim by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) that it has enough fuel despite lingering scarcity experienced across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers had at the plenary on February 10, while adopting a motion sponsored by the Chief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno (APC, Borno) mandated the Committee to investigate the release of the methanol-blended petroleum in the country with a view in ensuring that culprits are brought to book and make recommendations to avoid reoccurrence.\n\nThe lawmakers had also directed the NNPC Limited to suspend the companies involved in the supply of the bad fuel and as well submit their names to the committee.\n\nThe downstream committee was mandated to also ascertain whether the importation, distribution and dispensing of the product in Nigeria till date conformed with international standard.\n\nAt the plenary on Tuesday, Minority leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu (PDP, Delta) coming under order 8 rule 4, of the House rules, said the existing committee saddled with the responsibility of investigating the issue of adulterated fuel, should as well ascertain if there was an interim report on the claim by the NNPC Limited that it has enough fuel despite lingering scarcity experienced across the country.\n\nHe lamented that it was difficult for him to get to work because all the roads were totally blocked by those looking for petrol.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cI\u2019m coming under this rule for us to discuss the issue of lingering fuel crisis in Nigeria. I agree that NNPC said it has enough but it doesn\u2019t seem to tally with their submission that they\u2019ve enough fuel because there\u2019s still some lingering fuel crisis in the whole of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult for me to get here because all the roads are totally blocked by those looking for petrol. There\u2019s already an existing committee saddled with the responsibility of investigating the issue of adulterated fuel, so I\u2019m thinking they should find out if there\u2019s an interim report to that effect with their already existing assignment.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Elumelu\u2019s observation, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila directed the Committee to extend their investigation into the lingering crisis.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cThere\u2019s a nexus between that motion of last week on adulterated fuel and what you have very rightly brought up. The standing committee committee should take note and extend their investigation into this lingering crisis.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives has called on the Department of State Security (DSS) and the Police to thoroughly investigate circumstances leading to the killing of Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Abubakar Abdulkadir Rano, in Jibia division, Katsina state by terrorists.\n\nThe House while condemning the killing of the police officer and others, also directed the DSS and police to investigate similar ones across the country and help families of the deceased. The resolutions of the lawmakers were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance, sponsored by Hon. Kabiru Alhassan Rurum on at the yesterday\u2019s plenary.\n\nMoving the motion, Rurum said the late Rano, in charge of jibia Division was brutally killed by bandits while attempting to rescue a kidnapped woman.\n\nAccording to him, the police officer had recorded successes in confronting and fighting bandits in the area which helped in reducing attacks on communities. He lamented that since the incident, nothing had been done to investigate the circumstances leading to his killing.\n\nHe added that lack of prompt investigation into the killing of police officers killed in similar circumstances was a negative trend which needed to be addressed.\n\nAdopting the motion, the House observed a minute silence for the late DPO and other police officers who died while serving the nation.\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja",
