          "title": "Govt officials pay abductors secretly, ransom bill hypocritical \u2013 SOKAPU",
          "text": "The Southern Kaduna Peoples\u2019 Union has faulted the bill passed by the Senate prohibiting the payment of ransom to kidnappers in Nigeria, describing it as an action that would endanger the lives of kidnap victims if passed into law.\n\nThe Senate had on Wednesday passed a bill amending the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013, by prohibiting the payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nThis came 30 days after the abduction of the Abuja-Kaduna-bound train passengers by suspected terrorists.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, had said the amendments contained in the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2013 (Amendment) Bill, 2022, could turn around not the security situation in Nigeria and its fortunes when signed into law.\n\nBut SOKAPU accused the Federal Government of hypocrisy, arguing that top government officials secretly paid a ransom to secure the release of their loved ones while other victims from poor families were left at the mercy of their abductors.\n\n\u201cOur position as SOKAPU is that we are the worst hit by these kidnappings. We would have been the ones jumping up in happiness over the bill but to say that you have passed a bill to stop the payment of ransom is not enough in our opinion. The government must put certain mechanisms in place to solve the problem of kidnapping.\n\n\u201cWhen someone\u2019s relative is taken into a forest, there is no time of frustration and restlessness greater than that time. When a person, who is the breadwinner of another person is taken, everything is to be done to get them out.\n\n\u201cFrom our experience in Kaduna State, the governor has said he has nothing to do and he has not done anything to rescue the people that are being taken, so it is the poor families that are always selling everything they have ever got, borrowing money everywhere to save the people that are important to them,\u201d the National President of the union, Jonathan Asake, told our correspondent on Friday.\n\nAsake said the government had the capacity to and should track down kidnappers in the country rather than create a law criminalising the payment of ransom by families of kidnap victims.\n\n\u201cIf the government has not shown the mechanisms in place to rescue the victims of these kidnappings and is saying it wants to make a law to prohibit the payment of ransom, then it is saying kidnappers should kill people without caring. Meanwhile, high-profile people always secretly pay a ransom. When the train passengers were kidnapped, N100 million was paid for the CEO of the Bank of Agriculture; it was later that the secret came out but they claimed they didn\u2019t pay anything yet the poor masses are still there in the forest today with children and nothing has been done.\n\n\u201cSo, where did that money come from? If he was not a bank executive, would they have been able to pay the N100 million? So, that N100 million must have come from the government coffers. They are now making a law that the poor people should remain in the forests with kidnappers but when any of their relatives are kidnapped, they use government money to pay. So, there is a lot of hypocrisy about it (bill) and that is why we in SOKAPU are not in support of it,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, the Human Rights Writers Association said the Federal Government lacked the right to tell the citizens not to take steps to ensure that their loved ones did not suffer an unjustifiable death if it could not confront the criminals and terrorists responsible for the kidnapping.\n\nIts National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, said, \u201cThe legislation does not make sense at all. Locally, the security forces in Nigeria have shown remarkable incapacity to adequately tackle kidnapping and heightened insecurity.\n\n\u201cIf, as a government, you do not have the capacity or political will to confront criminals and terrorists who are kidnapping your citizens, what legal right do you have to tell your citizens not to take any kind of steps they wish to take so any member of their family does not suffer an unjustifiable and untimely death.\n\n\u201cSo, I think that legislation is not logical. That legislation is something that was done without rationality. That legislature is far away from the reality of the Nigerian situation now.\u201d\n\nOnwubiko said the Senate should have provided a legislative framework making kidnapping punishable by death to encourage states to create and enforce such law.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf it gives that legislative guideline, states that had been planning to create such law or had created it but had yet to enforce it would be encouraged to do so because kidnappers are supposed to be given the maximum sentence.\n\n\u201cIt (kidnapping) is a terrible offence that is worse than armed robbery. What is the National Assembly doing to get the President to either get the army to rescue the kidnapped citizen or impeach the President? It is an impeachable offence if the President cannot enforce the primary duty of the government to protect lives and property. This is what the National Assembly is supposed to face.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Former Vice-President and presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, has said some of his goals for the next four years from 2023 would include the enforcement of quota system and meritocracy, a judicious fight against corruption and introduction of diaspora voting into the electoral process.\n\nIn his mission statement posted on his website and circulated across emails, Atiku said some of his goals for the next four years from 2023 would include the enforcement of quota system and meritocracy, a judicious fight against corruption and introduction of Diaspora voting into the electoral process.\n\nThe former Vice-President, who was one of the presidential aspirants screened on Friday by the party ahead of its presidential primaries on May 28 and 29, said he and his team had branded his campaign with the message of unity.\n\nHe said to rebuild the country would require restoring its broken bond of unity amongst its diverse people.\n\n\u201cA house divided is an enemy onto itself. So, to truly stop the spiral of insecurity in Nigeria and restore confidence in our economy must begin by strengthening the bond of our national unity,\u201d he added.\n\nHighlighting his goals, Atiku said he would \u201cfix Nigeria and get it working for the greater good; unify the country and get its people talking about unity and development; rejig and rejuvenate the comatose economy; diversify and liberalise the economy to generate jobs and create new revenue avenues, enforce the true principles of federal quota system with emphasis on meritocracy.\u201d\n\nHe said further that he would declare national emergency on energy, security, education, public health and agriculture, among other critical sectors. He also said he would ensure women and youths\u2019 inclusiveness in politics and business and the prompt payment of pensions to retirees.\n\nThe former vice-president said he would \u201cbequeath a legacy of good governance and real dividends of democracy, fight corruption judiciously, invest in edu-innovation and plug into global e-commerce.\n\nHe added that he would \u201censure food availability and sustainability, adequate national security and citizens\u2019 welfare; upgrade and improve the living standards of security personnel and equipment for the Armed Forces; explore mutually beneficial foreign affairs policy, both at sub-regional, continental and international levels, revamp Nigeria as the giant of Africa, enrich and enlarge the coast of electoral process like due diligence, fairness and equity, plus the introduction of high-tech into elections in the country, like Diaspora voting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as the National Executive Committee of the party meets next week, the former Vice-President has urged the committee not to experiment with zoning ahead of the 2023 forthcoming elections.\n\nHe was quoted to have said this in a statement titled, \u2018Prioritise winning over zoning, Atiku tells PDP NEC\u2019, by the National Publicity Secretary of the Atiku Support Organisation, Dr Victor Moses, a copy of which was sent to Saturday PUNCH.\n\nPDP NEC will meet on Wednesday to decide on the issue of zoning its presidency to a particular region or allow every presidential aspirant to contest the primary.\n\nAtiku also noted that the battle ahead in 2023 was not one for trial and error, but one to save the \u201csoul of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe further called on the National Executive Committee of the PDP to eschew regional and primordial sentiments and throw open the contest for the presidential ticket to interested aspirants.\n\nPart of the statement read, \u201cThe battle ahead in 2023 is not one for trial and error, a test run or experimentation or is it one for young or old. It is essentially a battle to save the soul of Nigeria. It is a battle to save our children and the next generation to come.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is either we field our best to reclaim the seat of power and fix Nigeria or remain in the wilderness ad infinitum and watch the APC destroy us, the economy, and the country in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory will beckon on the leadership of the PDP as what will soon be decided on zoning (in the coming week) will not only have a major impact on redirecting Nigeria\u2019s path to greatness but also prove the readiness and preparedness or lack of it of the PDP to reclaim power in the 2023 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cNigeria is bleeding, fatally haemorrhaging and desperately needs a saviour. The destiny of over 215 million Nigerians hangs on your shoulders. As a party aiming to return to power in 2023, the PDP must not make a mistake that will cost it dearly and hurt Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we encourage the leadership of the PDP to eschew regional and primordial sentiment, jettison selfishness, and throw open the presidential ticket to all interested aspirants so that the best can emerge to lead the party to victory.\n\n\u201cTo secure victory in the 2023 elections, we need to follow vigorously and with all our strength to support a candidate with the needed capacity, mass following and national appeal to give us the desired victory in the 2023 presidential election against the disastrous performing APC-led government.\n\n\u201cI am the man who the cap fits to unite and rebuild Nigeria. The stakes are high in 2023, therefore, we cannot afford to start from square one,\u201d part of the statement read.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "A man\u2019s lifestyle can affect the quality of his sperm",
          "text": "By Bunmi Sofola\n\nExtensive daylight might harm the chances of fatherhood, claim scientists, but drinking and smoking don\u2019t damage a man\u2019s sperm quality, lifestyle factors long thought to have an effect, including obesity, make no difference. Even wearing tight underwear did not have an effect, despite dire warnings previously that prospective dads should invest in boxer shorts.\n\nThe only lifestyle choice that had a major impact was smoking cannabis, which can reduce a man\u2019s fertility by altering the size and shape of his sperm. A similar effect was discovered in the summer, although experts suggest it isn\u2019t heat but probably the length of the day and hormonal changes that are responsible. When less than four per cent of a man\u2019s sperm has a normal size and shape, statistics show he will find it harder to father a child and may need help from fertility techniques, including IVF.\n\nTeams from the universities of Sheffield and Manchester carried out the world\u2019s largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm. Using data from 2,249 men attending fertility clinics around UK, they compared the medical history and personal habits of 318 participants with less than four per cent of normal sperm and 1,652 whose sperm was of higher quality.\n\nMen in the first group were nearly twice as likely to have used cannabis in the three months before giving a sample. If they were aged under 30, they were also nearly twice as likely to have produced the sample in the summer months.\n\nThe scientists believe younger men were most affected by cannabis simply because they were most likely to use greater quantities. Chemicals in the drug itself, not the tobacco used in \u2018joints,\u2019 were probably responsible since cigarette smoking had little effect on sperm.\n\nOne of the team leaders, Dr. Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology \u2013 the study of male heath \u2013 at Sheffield University, said habitual cannabis users who wanted to become fathers should kick the habit for at least three months. I can\u2019t tell you definitively that your sperm will improve, but that\u2019s a reasonable assumption, he said.\n\nHe said the summer influence was surprising but it did not appear to be linked to heat or significantly alter seasonal conception patterns. \u2018We didn\u2019t expect this,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s complete conjecture on my part, but it could be a sunlight effect \u2013 day length affects our hormones and vitamin D in a sorts of ways.\u2019\n\nHe added that men wanting to be fathers should not wait until conjecture weather. However, the study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, found that abstaining from sexual activity for more than six days improved sperm quality. It was possible that unmeasured factors, such as the quality of sperm DNA, influenced the results, said the researchers.",

Sitting with Governor Okowa at the back is Chairman, PDP, Oshimili South LGA, Mr Dada Okonji.\n\nThe National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, on Friday, urged politicians to place high premium on the welfare of citizens, especially the ordinary Nigerians.\n\nAyu gave the advice at an empowerment programme organised for people in Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency by the Minority Leader and member, representing the constituency in the House of Representatives, Chief Ndudi Elumelu, in Asaba.\n\nAccording to him, politicians should not forget the ordinary people because without them and the support of the people, they cannot be anything as far as politics is concerned.\n\nHe lauded Elumelu for his outstanding contributions towards human capital development of the people in his constituency, adding that Delta was very lucky to have such an outstanding personality.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the minority leader had done well, the PDP chairman urged other representatives to replicate what Elumelu had done in their respective constituencies across the country, pointing out that the PDP was very proud of him.\n\n\u201cDelta State is very lucky to have such an outstanding personality. Elumelu has done very very well and the PDP is very proud of him.\n\n\u201cIf all our representatives across the country do this in their respective constituencies, it will help the party a great deal.\n\n\u201cWhat Elumelu is doing will enormously support the efforts that our governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, is putting for his people.\n\n\u201cI congratulate him for the concern he has shown to our people. I urge all politicians not to forget the ordinary people because without them and the support of our people, we cannot be anything as far as politics is concerned.\n\n\u201cIt is only their support that makes it possible for us to win elections as a party and for us to continue to be the big men that people say we are. You can\u2019t be a big man without a small man.\n\n\u201cTherefore, l will be very happy to campaign for any candidate who show concern for the ordinary people because our party, the PDP, was formed for the people with umbrella as its symbol,\u201d he said.\n\nAyu thanked the lawmaker for his contributions to PDP, adding ,\u201dI thank you for looking after the ordinary people of the PDP family and l urge everybody who is elected whether as a member of the National Assembly, State House of Assembly or as a councillor; if you cannot help a 100 people, try to help at least one to five persons.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa noted that Rt. Hon. Elumelu was doing great wonders in his representation of his constituents, adding that the event was not the first time he was empowering the people in the constituency.\n\nAccording to the governor, it is important that people continue to realise that when you find yourself in privileged position, you must honour people because it is through the votes of the people that we find ourselves in wherever we are as elected officials.\n\n\u201cI thank God for your life. Last year, l spoke glowingly of what you had done; today, it appears to me that you have even surpassed what you did last year; may God continue to empower you.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that anything that is done to engage every youth, every man or every woman in Delta State and to support them to succeed in life, such a person that does that is helping the government of Delta State to reach out.\n\n\u201cYou are aware that we have had several entrepreneurship programmes in Delta State, so anybody who complements that effort is high in our mind and l want to congratulate you with what we have seen here, today,\u201d he said.\n\nCongratulating Hon. Elumelu for his sterling contributions to the growth and development of humanity, Okowa urged the beneficiaries of the empowerment programme to make good use of the items given to them, stressing that they should continue to find a way to reach out to others.\n\n\u201cIt does not take only the rich to bless others, in your own very little ways, you can also bless others and bless a fellow party member. It helps us to grow as a people.\n\n\u201cIn our individual ways, whether you are a councillor, you are a supervisory councilor, you are a vice chairman, a local government council chairman, you are a member of House of Assembly, you in the National Assembly, you are a governor or deputy governor, wherever you find yourself as an elected official, help somebody and all of us in a privileged appointment should find somebody to help.\n\n\u201cBy the time we find one, two, three or four persons to help individually, we would have had a multiplier effect and it will be good for our nation, Nigeria,\u201d the governor added.\n\nAlso speaking, the PDP Chairman in the state, Chief Kingsley Esiso lauded Elumelu for his contributions to national development as well as his contributions to the socio-economic well-being of his constituents.\n\nEarlier, Elumelu had said that the programme was part of measures to give sense of belonging to men, women and youths of his constituency.\n\nHe used the forum to give a score card of his representation in the area of wealth creation, security, health and physical infrastructure.",

As a matter of fact, these are the people that make things to happen in the constituency\u201d.\n\nAsagunla added that the stakeholders took it upon themselves to raise money for the forms because Tunji-Ojo has been\n\ntoo nice and has also built people as well as identifying with his constituents at all times.\n\n\u201cWe know that he has the money to buy these forms, but we won\u2019t allow him to buy for himself. We raised the money by making contributions of N10,000, N1000 and even lesser amounts. We know that he will still buy forms for nothing less than 20 other aspirants in the federal constituency. We already made payment today for the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms and we will pick up the forms tomorrow\u201d.\n\nThe APC chieftain also said that Tunji-Ojo has transformed the landscape and lives of many people not just in his federal constituency, but across Akoko land.\n\n\u201cHe has changed the terrain of his constituency and and Akoko at large.

I came here because they just told me to come to this venue. I did not know why and I was surprised to see my leaders here. I am grateful to God. It is basically appreciation for what God has used us to do over the past three years and I am grateful to them for the confidence.\n\n\u201cTo the glory of God Almighty, He has used us to be able to facilitate massive construction of roads, solar projects and water projects. We have been able to build so many schools. We have been able to renovate health centres, provide ambulances, create employment opportunities, empowerment for market women and lots of other things.\n\n\u201cMy target is to continue to facilitate massive infrastructural development, human capital development and to continue to improve on what we have done and been doing in the past couple of years that have warranted our constituents to have the confidence of being able to raise this sort of money to support us just to continue and to make sure we do better.\u201d\n\nA former local government chairman of Akoko Northwest, Hon Gani Dauda, said Tunji-Ojo has demonstrated capacity in his first term.\n\n\u201cAt the last election, we supported Hon Olubunmi Tunji Ojo because we knew he was going to perform. Today, he has proven himself and that is why people like us are advocating that he should return to that same position. As a first timer, he has been able to galvanize his wealth of experience in his private business, and deployed to the activities of the National Assembly.",

          "text": "The federal government has again warned of the adverse effects of Female Genital Mutilation, insisting it is a crime against humanity, with no scientific benefits in medicine or healthcare and leads to grave health consequences for the female gender.\n\nMinister of Health, Osagie Ehanire and that of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen gave the warning while calling for an end to the practice described as ancient and crude by health professionals.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is a traditional practice in most of Africa, involving the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia, causing injury to the sex organ.\n\nWidely recognised as a violation of human rights, deeply rooted in culture, the practice has seen over 200 million girls and women circumcised in 30 African countries.\n\nWith an estimated 19.9 million survivors, Nigeria accounts for 10% of the 200 million FGM survivors.\n\nThe south zone of Nigeria is estimated to record the highest prevalence of FGM, with 77% of adult women cut. The southeast follows with 68% and the southwest zone at 65%.\n\nAt an event with the theme, \u201dMovement For Good to End Female Genital Mutilation,\u201d organised by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, Dame Tallen said there was no excuse to condone mutilating females in the name of culture.\n\nShe insisted that mutilation can never be done properly, considering the unsanitised tools and crude methods of the practice.\n\nTallen said, \u201cThere is no way that Female Genital Mutilation can ever be properly done. It is condemnable. It is a crime against humanity, it is evil and must be stopped\u201d.\n\nShe appealed to duty bearers in communities to be ambassadors against FGM, emphasising that eliminating FGM was crucial to realising many of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe Minister of Health Ehanire in his charge affirmed that the federal government has the moral obligation to increase material and financial support to eliminate the harmful practice\n\nHe warned of the social consequences of FGM in many Nigerian communities, stressing that investment to end it must be accelerated.\n\n\u201dIt is our moral obligation to increase material and financial support to eliminate this harmful practice of female genital mutilation, a procedure that attempts to remove external female genitalia supposedly for cultural therapeutic reasons\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe do not leave out health workers, especially in five states of Bauchi, Imo, Osun, Ekiti and Oyo for the movement for good to end FGM in Nigeria. This is a call upon us to step up investments to end this practice in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations envoy to Nigeria, Mathias Schmaltz, says despite Nigeria\u2019s commitment to global targets to end FGM, the country still trails behind.\n\nHe explained that only change in cultural values, political will, data availability, public awareness and advocacy can trigger a reduction in the prevalence of FGM practice.\n\nSchmaltz tasked the federal government to ensure increased funding and undertake preventive services for survivors of FGM.\n\n\u201cNigeria has made a strong commitment to ending FGM by 2030, with less than 7years to go, we are unfortunately seriously off track as the numbers show, to end FGM by 2030\u201d, says Schmaltz.\n\n\u201dThere are no known psychological or biological benefits of the practice, therefore, the time to end FGM in Nigeria is now and the responsibility lies with all of us\u201d.",

Goals from Spanish centre-back Pablo Mari, Spanish winger Gerard Deulofeu, Brazilian midfielder Walace and young left-back Destiny Udogie sealed the deal for Gabriele Cioffi\u2019s Udinese.\n\nInter Milan, on the other hand, lost 2-1 to Bologna recently with goals from experienced Austrian attacker Marko Arnautovic and forward Nicola Sansone while Croatia international Ivan Perisic scored the consolation goal for Inter Milan.\n\nThe two clubs last faced each other last year in Serie A, with Inter Milan beating Udinese 2-0.

          "text": "By Oluwamayomikun Orekoya with agency report\n\nKarim Benzema is having a standout season for Real Madrid and the campaign for him to win this year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or award keeps ramping up.\n\nThe French striker did his case no harm on Tuesday night in Manchester when his brace helped keep Los Blancos in the tie against Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City, who won 4-3 on the night.\n\nBenzema made sure that Real Madrid will have something to build on in the second leg and only have a one goal deficit to overcome in front of their own fans at the Bernabeu.\n\nIn all competitions for club and country this season, the 34-year-old has 46 goals and 14 assists in 48 games, which is a phenomenal haul.\n\nHe\u2019s beating the competition, too, as he\u2019s the top scorer in LaLiga Santander and the Champions League, as well as being the player in Spain with most assists.\n\nAge is not slowing Benzema down and once again we are seeing how he has flourished and even grown since stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s shadow, becoming a true talisman and leader for Los Merengues. The Frenchman is stepping up on the big stage, not just scoring goals but scoring important goals and playing an absolutely vital role in Real Madrid\u2019s Champions League run.\n\nHe also played a key role in Real Madrid\u2019s Supercopa de Espana win and France\u2019s Nations League title. And it won\u2019t be long until he\u2019s champion of Spain again.\n\nYet Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp believed the Champions League glory will help forward Sadio Mane win this year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or. The Senegalese star is said to be in contention for the best player of the year award having played an instrumental role in the Reds\u2019 quest for an unprecedented quadruple this season, as well as helping his country to a first-ever Africa Cup of Nations title. Mane, 30, was also on target in Liverpool\u2019s 2-0 win over Villarreal in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final at Anfield, scoring his 20th goal in all competitions for the club this campaign.\n\nAsked after the game if his player deserves the award, Klopp said he was unclear of the criteria for winning but noted claiming Europe\u2019s top prize should help Mane\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played an outstanding season,\u201d Klopp told reporters. \u201cSadio is an outstanding player.\n\n\u201cI have nothing to do with the Ballon d\u2019Or nominations. I don\u2019t understand it 100 percent.\n\n\u201cHe is world class. He again played a really good game for us but I have no idea, I don\u2019t know how you come with that question with the season not even over.\n\n\u201cHistorically you have to win something to win the Ballon d\u2019Or, most of the time it was like this. If you\u2019re not (Lionel) Messi or (Cristiano) Ronaldo you have to probably win the Champions League, which we haven\u2019t done yet.\n\n\u201cGive us a few more weeks and we will see where we end up. Sadio wants to contribute, Sadio wants to help the team and that\u2019s what I love most about it.\u201d\n\nFollowing their victory over the Spanish side at Anfield, the Reds are just 90 minutes away from the May 28 final in Paris.\n\nMane\u2019s brace in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Manchester City also means Klopp\u2019s side are in the final of the FA Cup where they face Chelsea on May 14.\n\nHaving beaten the Blues in the Carabao Cup final earlier in the season, Liverpool also sit just one point behind City in the Premier League with five matches to play.\n\nIn a related development, Liverpool could offer to extend Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane\u2019s stays at Anfield beyond the end of next season, according to journalist Ian Doyle.\n\nThe Reds announced on Thursday that manager Jurgen Klopp has signed a new two-year deal at the club to stay until 2026, while negotiations are also ongoing with Mohamed Salah.\n\nFirmino and Mane are due to become free agents in 2023 alongside Salah, but Liverpool Echo reporter Doyle is expecting the Reds to offer to extend the attackers\u2019 contracts for at least another year.\n\nWhen asked during a Q&A if there was any update on Mane and Firmino\u2019s contract situations, Doyle responded: \u201cNothing yet. In fact, I doubt there\u2019ll be much on contracts now until the season has finished. It isn\u2019t a priority right now as the focus is now completely on winning games and winning trophies.\n\n\u201cMind you, the potential last game is only a month away, so not long to wait. I\u2019d be surprised if Firmino or Mane leave in the summer, although certainly with the latter his stock is extremely high right now. I\u2019d imagine Liverpool will at the very least offer them something to extend their stay.\u201d\n\nMane has registered 20 goals and provided three assists in 44 matches this term, while the injury-hit Firmino has banked 11 strikes and four assists in 31 games across all tournaments.\n\nThe latter is currently dealing with a foot injury, and Klopp revealed on Friday that he will miss out against Newcastle United in the weekend\u2019s Premier League contest.",

          "text": "Liverpool handed huge shirt sponsorship and Nike financial boost with owners FSG to benefit from new Jurgen Klopp contract, writes SAM MAY .\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s new Liverpool contact extension to 2026 is huge for Fenway Sports Group (FSG) and everyone connected with the club \u2013 both on and off the pitch.\n\nThe 54-year-old has sign a new deal to extend his stay with the Premier League title challengers for a further two years, having previously suggested he could call time on his Anfield tenure when his contract expired in 2024.\n\nThe much-loved coach was trusted to steadily build his own team, which has come to fruition with the Reds getting their hands on the club\u2019s sixth Champions League in 2019 and then the Premier League title in the 2019/20 season, ending a 30-year wait to be English champions.\n\nThis season has already seen the club lift the Carabao Cup and Liverpool are now just a possible eight games away from making history with an unprecedented quadruple still on the cards.\n\nKlopp\u2019s extension is likely to see continued success on the pitch, but it will also increase the chances for the club to leverage their position off it, with commercial revenues and engaging with new partners.\n\nThe Reds are soon set to begin discussions over their shirt sponsorship, with their current \u00a340million-a-year deal with Standard Chartered ending in 2023.\n\nThe British banking firm began their long-standing partnership with the club in the 2010/11 season \u2013 becoming only the club\u2019s fifth shirt sponsor in their history after iconic deals with Hitachi, Crown Paints, Candy and Carlsberg.\n\nAccording to Liverpool Echo, the club have already begun to \u2018sound out other partners\u2019 over their shirt sponsorship, with Standard Chartered \u2018also part of the conversation\u2019 and \u2018engaged in ongoing talks\u2019 over a possible renewal.\n\nWhy Klopp\u2019s new contract is good news on this front, is that it puts the club in a period of stability as they head into a vital negotiation period.\n\nOf course, the team\u2019s recent results and silverware success will also help the club command top-tier deals from any incoming partners, with that success only likely to continue with Klopp still at the helm.\n\nWith the shirt deal ending in 2023 and Klopp\u2019s previous contract ending in 2024, that uncertainty over the manager and the team\u2019s future would likely have worked against the club as they look to negotiate for the best price.\n\nThe agreement with the American sportswear giant also sees the Reds receive 20 per cent from global sales of Nike/Liverpool merchandise, which is believed to raise the value of the deal closer to the \u00a360m-\u00a370m mark.\n\nKlopp being at the helm will aid the club when it comes to retail sales, too, as a successful team on the pitch means fans\n\nwill continue to purchase merchandise regularly on a global scale.\n\nPotential sponsors will have plenty of visibility, given Liverpool are challenging on all fronts including the Champions League.\n\nThere is also the fact they are one of the most broadcast clubs in the Premier League when it comes to live games domestically and internationally.\n\nKlopp\u2019s new extension could mean the likes of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino sign new long-term deals to remain at Anfield, which will also increase revenue through shirt sales. With Klopp extending, Liverpool are a hugely appealing proposition to commercial partners, with success both on and off the pitch set to continue.\n\nMeanwhile, Klopp has explained impact of his new Liverpool contract on Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane deals , saying: \u2018I don\u2019t think this would be the decisive thing\u2019.\n\nThe Reds boss was asked whether his renewed commitment to the club could see two of his best players follow suit.\n\nAs recently as last month, the German was talking about walking away when his current deal expires in 2024 \u2013 and his decision to stay marks a huge boost for the Reds as they chase a historic quadruple.\n\nWhen asked whether his commitment to the club could inspire Salah and Mane to sign on, Klopp said:\u201cThat\u2019s a question for the boys, to be honest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fine, my relationship with both is great. In life there is more to think about, but knowing who is the manager and coaching staff is important.\n\n\u201cThere is no 100 per cent in this business but it\u2019s very likely I will stay here for a while.\n\n\u201cEverything is clear at the moment, and if it\u2019s a positive sign for the boys, great. But I don\u2019t think this would be the decisive thing. They have their own lives to consider.\n\n\u201cWe just need to make sure that everyone who wants to be here knows what they can expect.\u201d\n\nAsked about his own contract, Klopp added that it \u2018made sense\u2019 to confirm his commitment to the club now before the end of the season, revealing it may aid the club\u2019s transfer business in the summer. The coach was speaking in yesterday\u2019s conference ahead of Liverpool\u2019s Premier League clash away at Newcastle \u2013 which is LIVE and EXCLUSIVE on talkSPORT.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense doing it now because it\u2019s important a lot of people know early what\u2019s going on,\u201d Klopp added.\u201cIt\u2019s good for transfer windows.\n\n\u201cWe cannot guarantee success, we can guarantee stability, and in these difficult times that\u2019s a big thing to guarantee.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why at the moment it\u2019s the right one.\u201d",

          "text": "This is a very tense moment in the political arena in Nigeria. Permutations, horse-trading, consultations, lobbying and all sorts of communications are going on nationally. The election is less than a year away and aspirants are in our faces. The All Progressive Congress (APC) have pegged their presidential forms at a hundred million naira and despite the outrage by most Nigerians, some aspirants have allegedly paid.\n\nThe Roundtable Conversation is aware that Nigeria tries to fashion its democracy after that of that of the United States of America. However, sometimes, the similarities seem to be only on paper. When it comes to the real democratic processes, the Nigerian political elite falls short for reasons based on parochial nuances.\n\nThe political party structures which form the basic systemic order for ideological differences seem to be absent in the Nigerian political space. For one, while the United States has two major political parties, the Republican and Democratic parties, there is still room for independents and a few smaller parties to run for elections. In the Nigerian case, there is a plethora of political parties with no remarkable political ideology. The Republican and Democratic parties in America are identifiable with certain basic ideological leanings and the members often align with such views and their success or failure often depend on how deep they are on the ideological graph.\n\nThe political parties have a structured way of accessing and deploying party finances, there are laws regarding how much candidates can receive from donors and as such, there are checks and balances. Most candidates get a fair chance at leveraging on the their supporters\u2019 donations. This makes it different from the Nigerian party structure where there are no strict monitoring of candidates and campaign finances. This lays bare the field and candidates often play the highest bidder game. This surreptitiously empowers certain individuals more than others.\n\nBecause public offices are taken very seriously, the political parties strive to pick candidates with the least character flaws and who have led a life of service in any sector. Sometimes there are exceptions as in any human endeavor but generally, there is always a sieving process even before the party primaries. Each political party self-filters its candidates through various processes like debates and media scrutiny of private and professional histories of aspirants.\n\nIn Nigeria, even while there is a song and dance about the practice of the American brand of democracy, certain characteristics stand out still as purely different and those things have seriously affected the development of the country that claims to practice a government of the people , by the people and of the people. There seems to be little or no introspection by both the political parties, aspirants and the general public.\n\nThe voters are often left with a choice between six and half a dozen because the political parties do not do enough to filter their aspirants. Political power at any level is held in trust for the people and as such, the professional and private lives of aspirants must matter to the party. Leadership means more than occupying a seat. It demands a lot of integrity and vision to work for the welfare of the people. This then presupposes that requestion to lead at any level of the democratic practice must be by individuals not only with the gravitas but the discipline and vision to carry things through.\n\nWith a lot of aspirants expressing their interest in the presidency for instance raises a lot of questions. What do they have to give, if they have been in public office at any level or presenting occupying any position, what is their report sheet like? What is the public assessment of their performances? Did they have any introspection and considered themselves the best candidate for the position of the president of the greatest black nation on earth? With their history, do they have the gravitas to change the fortunes of a Nigeria that is today the poverty capital of the world?\n\nThe Roundtable Conversation spoke to Dr. Tivlum Gabdriel Nyitse, a veteran journalist, author, scholar and a university lecturer and asked his views on most of the presidential aspirants at the moment. He believes that any candidate for any position whatsoever must have self-assess. For those aspiring to be president especially for those in office at the moment, have they done well for the country? If for instance you have been given a little sector in the government or you had served in any capacity, what do you have as your legacies?\n\nDo people just indicate interest just because they have enough money in an environment with little or no accountability? Can they give themselves pass marks in their present duty posts? If they are making reference to past political posts, what were their achievements? What are legacies are standing in their names?\n\nToday, we can reference a late Lateef Jakande as former governor of Lagos state that really made an impact in the housing and education sector. We remember a late Micheal Opara for his legacy in agriculture in the Eastern region, we remember a late Aminu Kanu for his compassion as governor in touching the lives of the poor people, we remember late Sam Mbakwe for the works and the passion which he put into leadership. What are some of the aspirants to the presidency coming with?\n\nToday, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) have been on strike, so what magic that the Labour Minister, Dr. Chris Ngige could could not perform to bring a resolution to the incessant strikes bring to the presidency? Most of the rail line jobs were done during the Jonathan presidency, today we are dealing with the rail terrorism that led to the death of many Nigerians and the abduction of others who are still in captivity, what has a Minister of transport, Rotimi Amaechi done to show empathy to the victims? He is being paid as the Transport Minister, how well has he done his work in that sector? Is his performance going to be replicated as president?\n\nThere must be basis for assessment. Even some of the present or past governors aspiring for the presidency, the people want to know what they have done for their states. What are the statistics of progress? How have they improved the lives of the people in their various states? How have the different governors created employment, made the money of the people work for the people?\n\nDevelopmental variables must go beyond renovating roads, digging boreholes, renovating school buildings instead of equipping them for optimal productivity. Dr. Gabriel believes leadership must go beyond grandstanding with the power that comes with a particular office. Leadership in a democracy must go beyond the usual rhetoric that the country has had to battle with in the past.\n\nEbelechukwu Enemchukwu, a Soft Skills expert, an Ace Compere and a former Mrs Nigeria was on our Rountable Conversation. To her, in terms of leadership for 2023, we as Nigerians must be thinking of people that can rescue Nigeria from the edge of the precipice. There is sadly a trust deficit on the political elite because the people have been disappointed in the past. So the people must realize that leaders come from amongst the them and they should pay attention.\n\nThe people must therefore look out for individuals with the pedigree, potentials and capacity to lead. Nigerians both at party leadership level and the people must be concerned with obvious red flags from most aspirants who have not proved their mettle in smaller public and/or private assignments in the past.\n\nWe must all be ready to channel our passion and that does not just mean being involved in everything. Passion for development should propel us all to show our displeasure when things are not being done well for the good of the people at any level of leadership. We might not have trusted our leaders in the past which is a sort righteous indignation but then we must make a conscious effort to contribute to leadership by being active, getting our voters cards, mobilizing others to participate in the electoral processes. Our political scene must involve all of us in various ways. We must fight apathy and docility because it can\u2019t propel development. We must begin to identify and reward those with merit with our votes. Let\u2019s all be vigilant and elect those with the merit and capacity to lead at any level. There are indices to those with potentials and track records to lead. How has he or she performed in little assignments, can the individual be trusted with leadership at the higher level based on the pedigree established in the past?\n\nNigerians can take a cue from the people of Anambra state in the last governorship election, one woman\u2019s story of rejecting a financial inducement to vote for a candidate of her choice went viral but what does that tell us? We all can be active in the choice of leaders and not be greedy enough to sell the future for a pittance and suffer for years. Some other voters despite the glitches from the INEC technology were patient enough to wait for hours of even days to exercise their franchise. That is telling the country that the people make choices in a democracy.\n\nSo when people tell Nigerians that they get the leadership they deserve it is true because in any democracy, the people by omission or commission elect those that determine their fate. Inaction during electoral processes with a defeatist attitude of, \u2018my vote won\u2019t count\u2019 means allowing others to determine your faith for four long years or even more given the power of incumbency in the political sphere. The power resides with the people. Every Nigerian must invest in the political process if we must elect credible leaders. We should not leave politics for only politicians.\n\nThe dialogue continues\u2026",
          "summary": "The political party structures which form the basic systemic order for ideological differences seem to be absent in the Nigerian political space.\nFor one, while the United States has two major political parties, the Republican and Democratic parties, there is still room for independents and a few smaller parties to run for elections.\nIn the Nigerian case, there is a plethora of political parties with no remarkable political ideology.\nEach political party self-filters its candidates through various processes like debates and media scrutiny of private and professional histories of aspirants.\nThere seems to be little or no introspection by both the political parties, aspirants and the general public.",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Northern elders move to draft in Lawan",
          "text": "By Doris Obinna\n\nThe dynamics of the 2023 presidential race in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) may change next week, with the expected surprise entry of President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan.\n\nUntil now, majority of the presidential aspirants in APC are from the South, with the exception of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, from the North. Some of the southern aspirants include Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo; leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunke Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Minister of Transportation, Hon Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Labour & Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nCompetent sources told Saturday Sun that some northern elders, who are desirous of having the APC retain power, looking at what is happening in the opposition political party, the Peoples Democratic Party, are working to draft Lawan, from Yobe in North East, into the presidential race.\n\nIt was gathered that the Senate President has been under immense pressure to join the race, since the northern elders mooted the idea and may succumb after the Ed-el-Fitr celebration, following a decisive meeting in Saudi Arabia by northerner powerbrokers, who had gone for hajj. He is likely to formally declare his intension to contest after the Sallah holiday.\n\nSources revealed that Lawan might become the dark horse who will become the consensus candidate of the APC in next year\u2019s presidential race. Afraid that the APC might field a presidential candidate from the South and be disadvantaged, the northern elders rooting for Lawan fear that in the event that PDP also succumbs to pressure and settles for a southern presidential candidate or opts for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar or one of the consensus candidate their counterpart in the PDP chose, former Kano State Governor, Musa Kwankwaso, who recently dumped the PDP and joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), would become a formidable force that could topple the apple cart.\n\nSpecifically afraid that Kwankwaso may become the favourite bride of northern voters, in the event of the above scenario, northern elders wants to draft Lawan as their own consensus candidate in the APC. It was gathered that the northern elders would set out to brief and get President Buhari\u2019s buy-in this weekend, before Lawan would be persuaded to formally join the presidential race.\n\nOne of the points the northern elders have marshalled out to convince Buhari, who, it was learnt, is tilting towards having a South East presidential candidate for the APC, include telling him that fielding a southern candidate when Kwankwaso is in the race or when the PDP could pick a northern candidate, would place APC at a disadvantage. Also, the group wants to tell Buhari that having Kwankwaso as a major northern candidate, in the expectation that APC and PDP could field southern presidential candidates, would give him an advantage and could lead to having a president who would emerge outside the scope of northern powerbrokers. The group also wants to tell Buhari that it would be disastrous for the APC to lose next year\u2019s election, as a president from another political party would cause the decimation and possible death of the governing political party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that the northern elders planning to draft Lawan are proposing a vice president from the South East or South West. Whichever geopolitical zone, between the South East and South West that does not get the vice presidential slot would produce the next Senate President, it was gathered.\n\nAlso, in the arrangement, the position of the Speaker, House of Representatives would be zoned to the North-West, while North Central would produce the Deputy Senate President. Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives will go to South South. The plan is to have all major positions shared among the six geopolitical zones as a way of having a government of inclusion.\n\nAccording to the northern elders\u2019 proposal, if Lawan is supported to become the president on the APC platform, he would do only one term, to allow South East take over thereafter. His coming is expected to consolidate the hold of the APC and also work for the political party\u2019s penetration to the South East, in order to make the transition of power to the zone after four years seamless and easy.\n\nSources say the pro-Lawan group is not sure how President Buhari would take the proposal, giving the fact that the President wants to surprise the South East with the APC presidential ticket. A South East senator has been consistent in saying that President Buhari may surprise the Igbo before leaving office, apparently referring to the President\u2019s disposition to have someone from the South East fly the APC presidential flag next year.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of Lawan on the emerging succession plot proved abortive. He and his aides refused to make comments. Lawan has been a supporter of Tinubu, in the expectation that the APC would concede the presidential ticket to the South, it was gathered. With the development, his support would shift, in the overall interest of the APC.\n\nOwing to the fact that northerners were not joining the presidential race in APC, there has been an assumption that the governing party would zone the presidential ticket to the South.\n\nThere has been agitation and pressure that power should shift to the South after President Buhari. Southern governors, in both APC and PDP, have severally stated that power should shift to the zone next year. The demand has been high in PDP until recently when pro-South presidency voices started coming up in APC.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo, residents of South East and groups in the area have condemned the heavy presence of the military and personnel of other security agencies on South East roads.\n\nThey lamented that the numerous tortuous and vicious illegal checkpoints on the dilapidated roads had made life unbearable for their people.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSaturday Sun learnt that the issue would be slated for discussion on May 5, as the Imeobi Ohanaeze deliberates on the 2023 Presidency and the security situation in the South East.\n\nA report released by a rights group, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety) alleged that a whopping sum of N306bn had been paid at gunpoint in the past 50 months covering August 2015 and October 2019 by citizens of Eastern Nigeria to estimated 600 military and 6,300 police roadblocks in the South East and South-South regions.\n\nA 2018 report by the group said the security agencies made over N100billion in three years by extorting road users in those Southeast checkpoints.\n\nDisturbed by the ugly trend, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor, recently hosted the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 82 Division, Maj-Gen. Taoreed Lagbaja, at the National Secretariat of the body.\n\nDuring their meeting, Ohanaeze Ndigbo explained to the Commandant the inhuman treatments the civilians undergo under the very armed forces whose primary duty was to protect them.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nObiozor lamented various forms of indignities that the people of South East encounter in the hands of the security operatives and demanded from the GOC, a security network that conformed to the best global practices. National Publicity Secretary of the group, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, yesterday, said the situation appeared to have further aggravated with checkpoints seen in every two kilometres in the region.\n\nAccording to him, this was at variance with what was obtainable in other parts of the country. Ogbonnia gave instance of Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership\u2019s recent visit to Abeokuta, Ogun State to celebrate with former President Olusegun Obasanjo at his 85th birthday.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe travelled by road from Lagos to Abeokuta, Ogun State, to celebrate Chief Olusegun Obasanjo at 85. To my chagrin, there was no single roadblock from Lagos to Abeokuta. In contra-distinction, every two kilometers in the South East has a roadblock. You would see an army roadblock, police roadblock, Federal Road Safety Corps roadblock, Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIO) roadblock, NDLEA roadblock or a combination of all, etc. Most disturbingly, each of the checkpoints extorts money, openly and shamelessly, from the road users.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that highly placed Nigerians had, on various occasions, drawn the attention of the GOC and the Commissioners of Police in the South East to the illicit activities of soldiers and policemen, whom they said had turned the highways and rural roads into a cash cow by extorting heavy fees from motorists passing through the roads.\n\nSeveral Igbo leaders who passed through the road to Igboukwu in Aguata L.G.A, Anambra State, for the burial of former Governor Chukwuemeka Ezeife\u2019s wife, Njideka, recently, had unpalatable stories to tell.\n\nAn elder statesman who attended a programme from Owerri, Imo State, recounted how they stood in traffic for more than one hour at a checkpoint in Ihiala, on the Onitsha/Owerri Expressway. \u201cThe traffic ground to a complete halt as there was no movement from Owerri to the Onitsha end. All the vehicles going to Owerri from Onitsha and verse versa all had their engines switched off. When a driver asked one of the hawkers selling water and snacks what caused the gridlock she said that it had been shut down till 8pm because the military men at the checkpoint had gone to pray and to break their fast. Therefore, the road had to be shut down. She said it was normal.\u201d\n\nAnother told the story of how he spent about four hours on his way to a burial at Oba. \u201cWhen we eventually got to the checkpoint after the road was opened I noticed that the military men were collecting N100 from every bus. The collection went on boldly without shame or care. The traffic jam stretched for over five kilometres either way. Governors Uzodimma and Soludo should intervene on this matter. This is unacceptable.\u201d In their reaction, Ohanaeze further stated that one of the worst things that can happen to any country is the populace, including children to watch the security operatives openly and shamelessly collect bribes from or rob motorists with arrogance and bravado.\n\nThe recurring confusion, it said, is how to draw a distinction between the notorious armed robbers with unlicensed guns and the government security operatives with licensed guns. The apex Igbo body said the illicit toll gate phenomenon has brought excruciating pains as a journey of less than an hour now takes over two hours because of gridlock mostly occasioned by these roadblocks and checkpoints.\n\nTwo other groups, the Igbo National Council (INC) and the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), have joined the call for the immediate dismantling of the various military checkpoints in the zone. Reacting to the development, the groups in their separate statements frowned at the alleged extra-judicial killings of youths in the zone as well as extortion by the military.\n\nPresident General of INC, Chilos Godsent accused the security agents of criminal extortion of motorists on checkpoints, maltreatment of travellers, adding that the joint military task force had on many occasions been procured and used illegally by civilians as debts collectors and tools to intimidate the people. President General of COSEYL, Goodluck Ibem, noted that the militarisation of the South-East is a further confirmation of the fact that Nigeria is a failed state.\n\nGodsent mentioned the military checkpoints at Ukwu Orji in Mbaitoli L.G.A, Akachi Junction along Aba Road in Naze, Imo State and Ihiala axis in Anambra State as the most notorious when it comes to the issue of extortion.\n\nAccording to him, the military personnel at these locations act with reckless impunity in maltreatment of travellers. Ibem declared: \u201cWe view the militarization of the South East as an insult and an affront on the sensibility and integrity of the people of the South-East and we vehemently condemn it and call for immediate dismantling of all military and police checkpoints because they have out-served their purposes.\u201d",

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nLeader of Afenifere, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, has been consistent in demanding that the Igbo should be allowed to produce the next president of Nigeria in the spirit of justice, equity and fairness. He has also suggested that all the presidential aspirants from the South West should withdraw for the presidential aspirants from the South East.\n\n\u201cI was taught politics of fairness, justice and equity. Have the Yoruba not produced the president and the vice president? Have the South-East got it? If you were in the shoes of the Igbo and the presidency is coming to the South and it is going back to the Yoruba, is that fairness and how would you feel? I love Nigeria to be one. Anything short of that; you are pushing the South-East out of Nigeria,\u201d he said in an interview with Saturday Sun.\n\nMeanwhile, Afenifere, on Wednesday called for a government of national unity to midwife a new democratic government in the country. The organisation in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, after a meeting held at country home of its Acting National Leader, Pa. Ayo Adebanjo, said such government would salvage the country from the issue of insecurity among others.\n\nThe group noted that for Nigeria to progress, it must first be restructured before the 2023 general elections. But to the Ilana Omo Oodua under the leadership of an Emeritus Professor of History, Banji Akintoye, Pa Ayo Adebanjo of Afenifere only expressed his opinion on the 2023 presidency.

He said it was not logical for Yoruba to abandon their own sons or daughters contesting for highest office in the land and support someone else.\n\n\u201cTo us Agbekoya, what we care for is restructuring of the country and that is what we have been agitating for.

          "text": "\n\n* Discloses Ife terracotta, bronze heads due from Netherlands, US *Says repatriated antiquities potential revenue earners\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Friday declared that the Federal Government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of looted Nigeria\u2019s artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta and bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums. The President gave the assurance while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\nSpeaking on the return of the artefacts, President Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin. He noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works are records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria cannot permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration has made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts. The President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the Federal Government will continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018In furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.\n\nThe legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York\u201d. President Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, Nigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts back to their countries of origin.\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes. He expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria can generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nAccording to him: \u2018\u2018We look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\u2018\u2018I am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on traveling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\u2018\u2018This can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times\u201d\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Oba of Benin informed the President that his Royal Court had concluded plans with the NCMM to establish an ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum to house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\nHe said:\u2018\u2018We want to reassure Mr President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin bronzes and artefacts not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u2018\u2018we hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u2019\u2019Also speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Umar expresses dismay, appeals for international community\u2019s intervention\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe photograph of a new-born baby girl delivered in a terrorists\u2019 den by a mother abducted during the March 28 attack on an Abuja-Kaduna-bound train has been released by the abductors.\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd.), told THISDAY the development was \u201cso sad and very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nUmar reiterated his call on the international community to intervene in the matter. He also faulted a portion of the bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013 that prohibited payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe world must know what is happening. This government is trying to cover up this and we all must keep talking about this. Before you know it, these people would spend 10 years, like the Chibok girls. There are thousands of kidnapped victims in northern Nigeria, but the governments don\u2019t want people to talk about it.\n\n\u201cTwenty-four hours ago, the senators passed a bill that anybody that pays ransom would be jailed. Can you imagine that? If the federal government cannot avert kidnapping and cannot rescue these people, what do you do?\u201d\n\nThe terrorist group suspected to be Ansaru, a breakaway group from Boko Haram, THISDAY gathered, released the picture of the new baby seen yesterday, on Wednesday night.\n\nARISE News Channel and THISDAY had two days ago reported the birth of the new baby by the abductee in the terrorists\u2019 den. A family member of the woman had first hinted that she had been delivered of her baby, although the identity of the new-born child was not disclosed until the terrorists released her picture.\n\nClad in a thick pink dress and a light lemon sweater cap, with her eyes closed, the baby looked healthy, with credible sources saying the terrorists invited a doctor to take the delivery of the infant.\n\nOut of the 63 abducted train passengers that were under captivity, only one passenger, Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA), Alwan Hassan, has so far been released after, allegedly, paying a ransom of N100 million.\n\nTHISDAY reported on Tuesday that one of the two pregnant women among the passengers kidnapped during the attack by the terrorists had been delivered of her baby.\n\nThe state of the other pregnant woman was not known by yesterday.\n\nThe terrorists, who attacked and abducted the passengers, had earlier this week released four different pictures of their victims, numbering 62, with the group allegedly insisting that they were not after a ransom, but an exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were in government custody.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had at a recent media briefing revealed that the federal government was working behind the scenes to secure the release of all the hostages currently languishing in captivity.\n\nNine persons, including a young medical doctor, were killed during the attack, with scores injured and over 60 passengers kidnapped.\n\nReliable sources said the terrorists appeared organised and coordinated because of the way they were able to get medical supplies into the forest, a development they described as still shocking to both government and security operatives.\n\nUmar had on Wednesday appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of victims of the Kaduna train abduction. In a statement issued in Kaduna, Umar had said the pictures of the victims, which trended on the social media, was disturbing. He appealed to the international community, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations with the terrorists to secure the release of the victims. He prayed God to touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on their innocent and vulnerable victims.\n\nUmar had stated, \u201cThe pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release.\n\n\u201cMay God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims.

          "title": "IMF: Fuel Subsidy Causing Deterioration in Fiscal Balance in Nigeria",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday maintained that prolonged payment of petrol subsidy in Nigeria was affecting the country\u2019s fiscal balance despite revenue increase from rise in global oil price.\n\nThe Washington-based institution stated this in its latest Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa titled: \u201cA New Shock and Little Room to Maneuver,\u201d released yesterday.\n\nIt stated: \u201cNet commodity exporters can receive fiscal windfalls only if they contain subsidy expenditures. For example, some oil exporters provide expensive and generalised energy subsidies to the domestic population which could lead to a deterioration in fiscal balances despite the revenue increase associated with higher export prices in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTherefore, removing generalised subsidies is crucial to ensure that the rise in commodity prices generates fiscal savings. It is then essential that these savings are directed largely to strengthening fiscal sustainability supported by strong governance frameworks, given the precarious conditions faced by many countries.\u201d\n\nThe fund reiterated that the country\u2019s foreign exchange policy was weighing on its growth, distorting investment, encouraging rent seeking. It also noted uncertainties in the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe multilateral institution also pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s growth was stronger than anticipated due to increase in manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cFor countries with limited reserves, authorities have sometimes offered favorable rates, including to specific sectors. But the resulting parallel market for foreign exchange in Nigeria and Zimbabwe can weigh on growth distorting investment, encouraging rent seeking, and adding to uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThe decision to return to a more unified framework is often difficult, but experience suggests that the shift to a market-clearing official rate is not in itself likely to lead to a sharp increase in inflation, as prices in the real economy tend to reflect the less-favorable parallel exchange rate; and removing exchange-market distortions can give a substantial boost to development, by reducing uncertainty and strengthening competitiveness.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the exchange reform implemented in South Sudan last year prompted a significant appreciation of the parallel market rate, helping to reduce inflation and insulating the country from rising global food prices,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report further reiterated that Nigeria\u2019s economic growth was expected to reach 3.4 percent in 2022, falling back to 2.9 per cent from 2024 onwards.\n\nIt added: \u201cNigeria\u2019s growth outlook has improved through higher oil prices and a stronger-than-anticipated recovery of manufacturing and agriculture. Growth is expected to reach 3.4 percent in 2022, falling back to 2.9 percent from 2024 onwards.\n\n\u201cThe outlook is subject to high uncertainty associated with oil prices and financial conditions. Moreover, low vaccination rates, rising security risks, and elevated price pressures weigh negatively on the medium-term growth outlook. Diversification away from oil will be critical to raise growth potential sustainably and reduce volatility.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Director of the IMF\u2019s African Department Abebe Aemro Selassie, while speaking on the report during a virtual media briefing at the ongoing IMF/World Bank spring meeting yesterday, noted that the recovery in sub-Saharan Africa picked up in the third quarter of 2021 and held up despite the onset of a fourth COVID-19 wave at the end of the year.\n\nHe said Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s estimated growth in 2021 had been revised upward from 3.7 per cent to 4.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cHigher oil prices may generate a windfall gain for the region\u2019s 8 oil exporters. But for the other 37 countries, they will worsen trade imbalances and increase living costs.\n\n\u201cIndeed, over the past couple of months we have increased our inflation projections significantly lifting the regional average for 2022 by a full four percentage points, and representing the worst outcome since 2008.\n\n\u201cThis year, eleven countries will face double digit inflation; almost all of these have flexible exchange rates, and almost half of these are fragile.\n\n\u201cFor most countries, the new crisis comes at an extremely difficult time as the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, fiscal and international buffers are already under strain, and policy space is limited.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond the pandemic and current geopolitical tensions, creating jobs and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals will require strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Veto: UN Dribbles Self In Search Of Relevance By Owei Lakemfa",
          "text": "THE United Nations Assembly, UNGA, deliberations and resolution on the veto power that was held on Tuesday, April 26, 2022, was two years in the making but was all hot air without substance.\n\nIt was a poor stage drama with a linear plot. The event was like a dog sharpening its teeth over two years for a great bite, only to realize it is toothless. The veto truth stood naked, but the 81 members who moved Tuesday\u2019s motion preferred to wrap it in layers of beautiful words and an inelegant top lace resolution which even the movers cannot explain.\n\nThe General Assembly meeting was a waste of time, its resolution an exercise in self dribble and self deceit gave the mistaken impression that it was moving to address the veto issue while in reality it was engaged in mere motions without movement.\n\nWhat the world needs, are not exhibition matches but a reversal of the veto provision that would give power to the General Assembly in line with democratic practices where the vote matters; where the minority will have its say while the majority, it\u2019s the way. To ensure the UN is not misused, resolutions can be carried out or reversed by two-thirds of the Assembly. A case where one country\u2019s vote is greater than the votes of 192 countries combined is unsustainable.\n\nA situation where three European brothers: Russia, France and neighbouring Britain can team up with their first cousin, the United States, and China, the lone voice from Asia, to dictate to the world, cannot continue. In fact, to show that the Security Council is essentially a European racket, there was a 22-year period from 1949 when following its revolution, China was denied its seat in the Council.\n\nThe veto which essentially grants five countries proprietorial rights over the world body was inserted into the UN Charter at birth in 1945 after the collapse of the 1919 League of Nations. The League had collapsed under its own weight of vengeance against Germany leading to the second European war which was christened the Second World War, WWII. Then, most of the world was under European colonial occupation and the colonized were simply thrown into a war they knew nothing about. It was of no comfort to the colonized whether their oppressors were German, Belgian, Dutch, Briton, American or French.\n\nThe five countries which awarded themselves the veto when the UN was founded are often presented as the gallant victors who saved the world from Hitlerite Germany. The truth, however, is that China, which was under Japanese invasion, was not in a position to declare war against Germany. Russia, Britain and France were initially allies of Hitler, while the US was too timid to join WWII until 27 months into the conflict.\n\nBritain under Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sought to appease Germany in the 1930s to the extent of allowing it to seize territories. Britain in fact, regarded Hitlerite Germany as an ally with which it could go into a military alliance to destroy its main enemies: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, USSR (now inherited by Russia) and Imperial Japan.\n\nThe overwhelming populace of France and their government, supported Hitler and fought on the German side for four-fifth of WWII before switching sides. France which fought the allied forces, including outside Europe, only turned against Germany when it was obvious the latter was losing the war.\n\nThe US in the first two years of WWII declared it was neutral and its Congress refused to support either side of the war until December 7, 1941 when Japan was said to have attacked Pearl Harbour. Even at, it was against Japan it declared war and did not enter WWII until after Germany and Italy declared war on it for attacking their ally, Japan. One week before WWII started, the USSR declared its neutrality by signing the August 23, 1939 \u201cTreaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\u201d. Also known as the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact, the agreement which was planned to last for 10 years was a written guaranteed peace between both countries and a pledge not to aid the enemy of either side.\n\nSo effectively, the USSR was neutral in WWII until June 22, 1941, when Germany unilaterally terminated the agreement by invading it. While the USSR suffered the highest casualty rate in the war with 20-25 million dead, it inflicted the greatest casualties on Germany by killing 76 per cent of the total German military fatalities in WWII.\n\nIn the case of China, it was invaded by an ally of Germany, Japan, from July 7, 1937 \u2013to September 9, 1945; so it merely tried to survive during WWII.\n\nSo the claims that the five permanent members earned their pips saving the world and guaranteeing world peace are not exactly correct. The simple fact is that they were those at the table when the UN was being founded while most of the world either lay in ruins or were colonies.\n\nIt was assumed that unless the five agreed, the UN was doomed; so they were empowered to make decisions that would be binding on all members, including levy war. On the over 200 occasions the veto had been applied, it had been abused; used merely to further political, economic or racial interests such as maintaining minority White rule in Zimbabwe, Apartheid in Namibia and South Africa and Israeli genocide in Palestine.\n\nThis Tuesday\u2019s vote was primarily a farce because it in no way challenged the suffocating veto power; it essentially asks the member wielding the veto to explain its actions which in any case can neither be legally challenged nor overturned.\n\nIf under the new resolution, the General Assembly meets within 10 workdays to listen to why a veto was used and debates it while being aware it has no power to reverse it, is it to exhibit its impotence or a mere moral challenge? Even the Liechtenstein\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Christian Wenaweser, who led 80 co-sponsors of the resolution, hinted at its impotence when she admitted that all it aims to achieve is \u201cto promote the voice of all of us who are not veto holders, and who are not on the Security Council, on matters of international peace and security because they affect all of us\u201d.\n\nSuch exercise in futility is like a dog barking at its owner; what can it do, bite? In any case, even if a dog is to bite, it must have teeth that the General Assembly does not have. Only the death of veto power can transform the United Nations from a rubber stamp assembly to a body reflecting the wishes of most of humanity.",
          "summary": "THE United Nations Assembly, UNGA, deliberations and resolution on the veto power that was held on Tuesday, April 26, 2022, was two years in the making but was all hot air without substance.\nThe League had collapsed under its own weight of vengeance against Germany leading to the second European war which was christened the Second World War, WWII.\nThe truth, however, is that China, which was under Japanese invasion, was not in a position to declare war against Germany.\nThis Tuesday\u2019s vote was primarily a farce because it in no way challenged the suffocating veto power; it essentially asks the member wielding the veto to explain its actions which in any case can neither be legally challenged nor overturned.\nOnly the death of veto power can transform the United Nations from a rubber stamp assembly to a body reflecting the wishes of most of humanity.",

          "text": "Mike Ozekhome, human rights lawyer, says former President Goodluck Jonathan is \u201cconstitutionally\u201d qualified to contest for president in 2023.\n\nJonathan was Nigeria\u2019s vice-pesident between 2007 and 2010. He became the president in May 2010 following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and completed the latter\u2019s tenure.\n\nHe won the 2011 presidential election, but lost his attempt to secure a second term in office in 2015.\n\nRecently, there have been speculations that Jonathan may defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest in the 2023 presidential election, but he is yet to declare his interest in the presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral support groups have also asked him to run for president.\n\nReacting to the calls for Jonathan to contest the presidency, Femi Falana, a human rights advocate, said section 137(3) of the constitution disqualifies Jonathan from contesting.\n\nFalana said Jonathan would spend a cumulative period of nine years as president, if he contests and wins the 2023 presidential election, adding that a person is constitutionally allowed to spend two terms of eight years as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFalana\u2019s comment has sparked varied legal reactions.\n\nSection 137(3) of the fourth alteration to the 1999 constitution reads: \u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term\u201d.\n\n\u2018JONATHAN CONSTITUTIONALLY QUALIFIED TO CONTEST PRESIDENCY\u2018\n\nJoining the fray, Ozekhome, in a legal opinion released on Friday, said it would be \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d to deny Jonathan the right to contest for the 2023 presidency when the county\u2019s extant laws and court decisions permit him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that the antagonists of Jonathan running in 2022, in their strange line of argument, are mainly relying on the above section 137(3),\u201d Ozekhome said.\n\n\u201cThey have probably not adverted their minds to sections 141 of the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended, and section 285(13) of the same fourth alteration to the 1999 constitution, as amended, which they are relying on.\n\n\u201cMore revealing is that these antagonists are probably not aware of an extant and subsisting court of appeal decision where Jonathan was frontallly confronted and challenged before the 2015 presidential election, on the same ground of being ineligible to contest the said 2015 election, having allegedly been elected for two previous terms of office.\n\n\u201cThe section 137(3) being relied upon by the antagonists was signed into law in 2018, three years after Jonathan had left office. Can he be caught in its web retrospectively?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is clear that those deliberately misinterpreting the clear position of the law may be baying for Jonathan\u2019s blood, possibly as a potential candidate who may subvert the chances of their preferred candidates.\n\n\u201cI do not view issues from such a narrow ad homine prism and blurred binoculars. It will be grossly unfair, unconstitutional, unconscionable and inequitable to deny Jonathan of the right to contest the 2023 presidential election when our extant laws and appellate court decisions permit him to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe question of whether Jonathan really needs to subject his glittering and internationally acclaimed reputation and credentials to the muddy waters of a fresh competition with persons, some of whom were his personal appointees as president, is another matter altogether.\n\n\u201cOnly him, and not the present state of the laws in Nigeria, can answer that question and decide his own fate. But, as regards his eligibility to contest, Dr Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is pre-eminently constitutionally, morally and legally qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election.\u201d",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate. Since its launch, Eden Life has provided over 150,000 services in Nigeria.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Prosper Otemuyiwa, and Silm Momoh co-founded the company in Nigeria in 2019. It connects busy professionals with concierge services, and a subscription service that delivers high-quality chef-prepared meals, laundry services, and house cleaning.\n\nComing in with a twist: Unlike Lagos, Nairobi users get an additional service: a beauty and wellness service.\n\nWhat you should know about Lynk: The platform was launched in 2015, and it facilitated over 150,000 jobs, transferring $4.5 million to over 2,000 workers across four major verticals: beauty & wellness, cleaning & care, installation, repair & maintenance, and furniture & decor.\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePort 365, an African digital freight forwarding company, has raised $5 million in seed funding to drive end-to-end digitisation of freight management in Africa and support its expansion into new markets.\n\nLed by Mobility 54 \u2014 VC arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group \u2014 SBI Investment, Flexport, ODX, a Singaporean syndicate fund, Samurai Incubate, and other angel investors participated.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do? Launched in 2019 by Hio Sola-Usidame (CEO), the platform covers air freight, ocean freight, inland haulage (trucking, barge, and rail), and Pay-As-You-Go warehousing, marine insurance, customs brokerage, and more.\n\nCurrently, OnePort 365 is creating an operating system for African cross-border trade, assisting traders in managing their freight processes via a digital platform that enables seamless freight forwarding and other value-added services.\n\nAccording to OnePort 365, traders no longer have to wait up to two weeks to compare the best rates from various service providers. They can explore competitive offers on the platform and book freights in 30 seconds or less using pre-negotiated rates.\n\nIt currently operates in Nigeria and Ghana, and is exploring other markets. The platform also makes use of advancements in payment technology and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to enable instant payments.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve efficiency and lower overheads in cross-border trading across the continent, and to launch several new services that will boost overall profitability.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work.

Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Please take a look at it in the next story.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show you the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly on Saturday, April 23, 2022, I was at home, relaxing and watching a movie. But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain awareness and user education is a background check that must be done to foster blockchain adoption. Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey?

          "text": "The African Development Bank (AfDB) says that Africa currently faces an infrastructure financing gap of between $68 billion and $108 billion annually.\n\nAccording to the bank, this is in spite of collective efforts to close the margin.\n\nThe bank said this in a statement obtained from its website on Friday. The statement quoted Akinwumi Adesina, president of the AfDB, to have said this when the secretary of the United States Treasury, Janet Yellen hosted G-7 ministers and heads of multilateral development banks.\n\nAdesina said the bank, which was the premier financier of infrastructure in Africa, had committed more than $44 billion to infrastructure across the continent in the last six years.\n\nRead also: Funds, asset managers should invest in digital infrastructure \u2013 Tizeti CEO\n\n\u201cThe $44 billion was channeled toward developing critical areas like transportation, energy, water, and sanitation on the continent.\n\n\u201cI propose eight solutions to bridge Africa\u2019s infrastructure finance gap, which includes project preparation and mobilising institutional investors.\n\n\u201cOther solutions are improving public financing for infrastructure, mobilising financing for green infrastructure, attracting the private sector, and dealing with risks, among others,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe AfDB chief noted that institutional investors including pension funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and insurance companies held enough resources to scale up infrastructure financing from billions to trillions of dollars.\n\nAdesina said that collectively, the institutions with commercial banks held 103 trillion dollars of assets under management.\n\n\u201cThis pool of capital is so vast that what is needed is only 0.03 percent or up to 0.04 percent to bridge the infrastructure financing gap for Africa.\n\n\u201cMultilateral development banks should take early-stage investment risks in the project development phase, he said.\n\nHe called on governments to focus more on attracting the private sector to infrastructure financing.\n\nAccording to him, governments must improve the policy, legal, and regulatory environment to support public-private partnership (PPP) investments in infrastructure.

          "text": "Fresh anxiety is brewing in the All Progressive Congress (APC), as the national chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu, says the party is yet to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to any region.\n\nSpeaking to State House journalists at the Presidential Villa, in Abuja on Friday, after presenting the Ekiti APC gubernatorial candidate, Abiodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari, Adamu said the decision on which part of the country should produce the ruling party\u2019s presidential candidate was beyond him.\n\n\u201cI am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot pre-empt what the party decision will be.\u201d\n\nRead also: Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses offers seven practical tools on how to cope with pandemic anxiety\n\nAdamu\u2019s statement is coming after the party had earlier zoned national offices between North and South, which led to his emergence as the national chairman. He is from the North Central.\n\nAdamu\u2019s position aligns with Nasir el-Rufai\u2019s, the governor of Kaduna State, that the party had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket.\n\nSpeaking on the N100 million for the APC presidential nomination form, Adamu said the party has no regrets over the cost of nomination forms for candidates seeking elective positions under the party.\n\nHe described the decision as part of a deliberate plan to discourage those that have no chance of winning elections to sponsor individuals to play the role of spoilers.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe cost also had to be exorbitant because of the need to raise sufficient funds to successfully prosecute coming elections\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the issue of cost, yeah, I\u2019ve been listening with rapt attention to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through the presidential campaign, go through the election for the president. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contests, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheaply by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, will sponsor people into parties that have no prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention.\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from, if your traditional ruler dies today (God forbids), contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million. It\u2019s no news.\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was a token of N5 million, N10 million, including the expression. When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it took him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million to contest.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue going begging.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win elections.

          "text": "A research study supported by Shell Nigeria has revealed that Nigeria loses between N30 and N60 trillion annually to oil theft, illegal refining, and pipeline vandalism.\n\nThe head of the research team from the University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT), Ogoni-born professor of history, Ben Naanen, said 200,000 barrels of crude oil, or 14 percent is stolen every day out of the 1.4m bpd produced in Nigeria. He, however, said that other sources in recent times have put it at 30 percent or some 470,000 bpd.\n\nAt the price of over $100 per barrels with one dollar exchanged at about N411 in the official market, the loss is between N8.2bn and N17bn per day, making it between N30 trillion and N60 trillion loss per year.\n\nThe professor said the financial loss was nothing compared to huge damage to the environment and ecology of the oil region let alone human tragedies and disasters, including the roasting of hundreds of citizens often from explosions at fire disasters at bust pipe sites such as the almost 200 persons that were believed to have been roasted last week at Egbema, between Rivers and Imo states.\n\nThe researcher, who advised Nigeria to think outside the box and copy other countries, submitted that the much-touted modular refinery option may not arrest the disaster.\n\nRead also: IMF urges Nigeria, other oil-exporting countries to build buffers\n\nHe suggested regularisation strategy by approving the refining activities but not without rules on how to operate, especially stopping the operators from stealing the crude, and regulating how they refine crude without having to destroy everybody and everything around.\n\nNaanen said by doing this, the government would recoup revenue through tax and support many jobs.\n\n\u201cNigeria must go outside conventional approaches to arrest the menace, we must think outside the box if old methods are not working. Nobody has all the answers, but Nigeria must seek something new to tackle the theft as well as the environmental and human disasters that have emerged.\u201d\n\nThe researcher, who said his team visited the forests and creeks for months, said: \u201cVisit to the creeks shows devastated areas everywhere. Pipes laid by oil thieves run several kilometres to bunkers that serve as storage. There are fire-resistant tanks for boiling. The products are carried in Cotonou boats to deliver to different sales points.\u201d\n\nThe head of Shell\u2019s Ogoni Restoration Project (ORP), Vincent Nwabueze, who admitted that SPDC supported the research study to look at vandalism and oil theft, said tidal waves along the Niger Delta coastal areas wash the pollution along the coast, thereby spreading the pollution and poisoning aquatic life along.\n\nHe said \u201cWe are looking beyond Nigeria in the size of pollution. Oil theft goes beyond Nigeria up to Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, etc, but the governments of those countries are doing much to contain it. In Nigeria, people are now asking questions because awareness is increasing.\n\n\u201cIndustrialisation will not happen without a partnership between oil companies and universities.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned some challenges encountered in the remediation project going on in Bodo in Ogoni and said it was difficult to get undisturbed soil for testing because what they have is sediments. \u201cWe will review the Naanen report, critique it, and refine it to come up with a working document.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the presentation workshop, a Catholic cleric, Edward Obi, known for his advocacy to save the environment, said the Naanen research has opened peoples\u2019 eyes to the hazards in the region.\n\nHe said Naanen has long-standing commitment to stopping pollution and protecting the environment. \u201cHe often presents academic papers on the environment and oil. There is an urgent need to expose the truth and the facts of illegal oil refining.\u201d\n\nThe vice-chancellor of UNIPORT, Owunari George, described the researcher (Naanen) as a serious academic. \u201cHe is keen on oil issues. We must listen and make use of the information gathered in the course of research in the upstream sector of the oil industry,\u201d George said.\n\nThe Emohua local council chairman, Chidi Lloid, who gave hair-raising accounts of his encounter in the forests hunting down illegal refiners, said the lecture required a larger audience because of the size of the menace. Lloid said most security agencies were complicit in the matter and that a senior police officer going around with him in the forests ended up being an organiser of over 15 illegal refining centres.\n\nThe audience recommended several measures, including the research recommendation of regularising the activity, but said there would still be obstacles to cross.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBarely a week after the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Andrew Adaze Emwanta was presented with an Award by his Alma Mata, Annunciation Catholic College, Irrua, ACC, the Law students Government of Benson Idahosa University, LAWSA have presented a congratulatory card to him for his well deserved appointment.\n\nThe President of Benson Idahosa University Law student association, Ansa Joshua who led other members of the executive to the office of the Commissioner in Benin City, said they have come to congratulate him for the appointment which was earned due to his dedication and pragmatic approach to duty.\n\n\u201cWhile we were sworn-in, the faculty informed us that an erstwhile President of the Association was sworn in as a Commissioner in Edo state. We were told of your great works in the faculty which includes the accreditation of the faculty during your tenure.\n\n\u201cWe deem it fit and proper to visit you even though belated and to acquaint you of our activities during our law week and to request that our erstwhile President who is the Commissioner of Communication and Orientation embrace this event as the chairman.\n\nAccording to him, the law week is expected to commence from June 13 to June 17 2022 with inter chamber competitions, other competitions, election, grand dinner and lecture which will be on constitutional law taking into consideration the fact that the 2023 elections is drawing near.\n\nThe Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Andrew Adaze Emwanta Esq. in his response said it was a thing of joy to host the LAWSA Government of Benson Idahosa University because it brings back nostalgic feelings\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was in this manner we visited dignitaries in and out of government soliciting their support during our law week and for me I have always participated in LAWSA activities from the time I got into BIU.\n\n\u201cI was so committed that little did I know I will become President of LAWSA. We started off as Pioneers and we did not have a constitution which was our first task. When I came in I felt for us to have a system there must be a legal basis for that system to operate.\n\n\u201cThe good thing was that I came in as a direct entry student and there was need to put into work our constitutional knowledge as student of constitutional law. When the time came for election I first indicated interest to run as Vice President.\n\n\u201cI actually won the election but it was rigged because they saw some of us coming in as people who believe in change. We felt Law students should be trained in a manner that they should be able to separate the law and religion.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in, we did not have a good court, a statue of Justice and we fought that there must be a symbol of what the law faculty should be and we were able to garner funds through community development to provide us with that statue of Justice at the time.\n\n\u201cThose were some of the things we did when we were there and eventually I ran for the office of LAWSA President and I won. Before I came on board we had just one democratically elected president and when I came on board I was the second person elected and there after I was elected as the National President of LAWSA for all Private Universities.\n\nHe noted that he would not be sitting as a Commissioner today if he was not a student of BIU because according to him BIU taught him how to see himself as a future leader and the institution also created that professional environment.\n\nIn his words, \u201cthat created a system of playing politics. Even while in LAWSA we were also involve in the National Association of Nigeria Students activities and at some point I was made the liaison Director of zone two.\n\n\u201cIt afforded me the opportunity of mixing with people and that is what I should encourage all of you, try as much as possible to mix with those in other Universities. There are so many benefits you get when you do not limit yourself.\n\n\u201cAs a former LAWSA President, the moment you invite me for an event I am under obligation to attend and that obligation extends to my colleagues who are lawyers. I will assist you in any way you want me to.\u201d\n\nWhile admonishing the law students to take their academics seriously, Hon Emwanta maintained that during his days at BIU, reading was a culture and he took the students down memory lane how he became a Commissioner.\n\n\u201cAs a lecturer at the University of Calabar for over a decade, at some point I said to myself that leadership runs in my vein and I cannot achieve that through lecturing, how can I give back to my state. I had to come back to Edo State.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me I did not go through any godfather, the governor saw competence in me. I made that commitment to represent what is good, what is right and what is just and the Edo 2020 governorship election, you will agree with me was a just cause and it was because I believed in that just cause that I was so rewarded.\n\nAccording to him, none of them cannot achieve what he has achieved but what is required is commitment, first to their academics because nobody just occupy an office from nowhere, there must first be competence.\n\n\u201cThen secondly, the law students must work towards achieving any set target. Any one of you can become the governor of your state, but you must start somewhere, by setting that trajectory,\u201d the Commissioner added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, OsogboThe governorship candidate for Accord Party in the July 16th gubernatorial election in Osun state, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi has said what he would differently to improve the welfare of the state citizens if elected governor.\n\nOgunbiyi said Osun\u2019s economy is in dire straits with civil service as the only source of income.\n\nThe Accord party flagbearer stated this during a visit to the state secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners, NUP in Osogbo on Thursday.\n\nAccording to him, the only way to enhance economic viability of the state is to make it an industrial hub.\n\nHe said if elected governor, he will do all within his reach to ensure that the state is industrialized saying, by this, more income would be generated, which will make the state viable financially to be able to cater for the welfare of the pensioners and workers.\n\n\u201cOnce we industrialize the state, we will have the income and the resources that are needed. I have a way to attract people here who would invest in Osun. People who would invest in agriculture and mining,\u201d he said.\n\nOgunbiyi assured pensioners of total commitment to their welfare if voted, noting that that misplaced priority by the current administration made it difficult for them to adequately cater for the well-being of the old citizens who toil day and night to see to the growth of the state.\n\nHe said, full concentration would be on agriculture and mining to make the state food basket if not for the nation but the Southwestern region and that he would structure the mining so it can\u2019 get the 13 1/2 derivation for the state.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s money that\u2019s being thrown around, that\u2019s being encouraged by the government. But when we get there, we will structure it, to the extent that the entire world will know how much is being produced, so we can lay a claim to that derivation from the Federal Government, and Federal Government in turn, will keep up a plain sheet, so when we create avenues for us to generate income, there will be an opportunity to pay the workers. The arrears and whatever it is,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his speech earlier, the Executive Secretary and Chairman of the union, Comrade Dele Aina and Alhaji Ganiyu Salawu implored the governorship hopeful to priotize payment of gratuities and other emoluments of the members of the union who were unable to cater for their health due to their entitlements not being paid by the government.\n\nComrade Aina who tabled the requests of the union before the Accord Party governorship candidate urged him to take a critical look at the requests and give it necessary consideration if voted in.\n\nAina who applauded the governorship hopeful for the step taken to meet the union said, he would be the first governorship candidate to visit the union ahead of July 16th election in the state.\n\nThe meeting was witnessed by representatives of different groups within the Osun NUP",

Stomach infrastructure under my watch as president of Nigeria will be a major theme.\n\n\u201cNo one is saying here that you will not do the needful in terms of developing the country, part of development is the welfare and well-being of the people.\u201d\n\nStating his position on zoning, Fayose insisted that for posterity\u2019s sake, PDP must zone its presidential ticket in order not to confuse in the future.\n\nAccording to him, even if the party wants everyone to contest, it should officially make a pronouncement and zone it to the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\nHe recalled that in 1999, the presidential ticket was zoned to the south when former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Olu Falaye were in the race, but Abubakar Rimi still contested within the ambit of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBut the party must remember that whatever we do today, will speak for us or stand against us tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe system is not functioning in our country; the institutions are not functioning, that is why we have all these problems.\n\n\u201cWe must be courageous enough to say this is going to South, and If you want to contest, the Nigerian constitution still gives you the leverage, the opportunity to do so. I support zoning this time to southern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFayose said that with the incumbent president from the north, it was only logical for the south to produce the next president, saying this was not about the party, but about Nigeria\u2019s best interest and stability.\n\nNAN",

I will back such regulatory control that will improve the fiscal responsibility and inclusive politics in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the outrage against the exorbitant nomination fees, the ruling party continues to defend it.\n\nThe National Chairman of the party, Abdulahi Adamu, said the N100 million nomination form should not be expensive for aspirants.\n\nHe argued that if a presidential aspirant cannot raise the money, he does not have any reason being in the race.\n\nSouth-east presidency\n\nSpeaking on the clamour for South-east Presidency, Mr Nnamani, who hails from Enugu State, said the region owes Nigeria the best candidate.\n\nHe said many in the South-east as well as some legislators asked him to avail the nation \u201ccharacteristic honest, competent and disciplined leadership\u201d he offered the senate.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that there is a growing consensus that the next president should come from South east. I believe that the people of the South-east owe other Nigerians the reciprocal respect of bringing forth the best to lead.\u201d\n\nMr Nnamani will have to contend with other aspirants from the South-east, including Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Rochas Okorochas, Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige, Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba.\n\nOthers from outside the region gunning for the APC presidential ticket include Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Governor of Lagos, Bola Tinubu, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River, and former Ogun governor, Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nIn protest against the inability of the ruling party to micro-zone the presidency to the South-east, Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State and serving senator, said he was considering pulling out of the race.\n\nPlan for Nigeria\n\nMr Nnamani said he has the template used by leaders of South Korea and Japan for rapid economic development.\n\nTo transform the country, he stated that he will restructure Nigeria from inefficient consumption to production.\n\nHe stated that there is a need to \u201crecover the state from the grip of despair and despondence and chart a future of hope and achievement for every Nigerian.\u201d\n\nMr Nnamani was the President of the Senate from 2005 to 2007 and was instrumental in quenching the third term agenda of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nMr Nnamani joined the APC on January 22, 2017.\n\nLast month, he lost the bid to become the National Vice Chairman (South) of the APC during the March 26 convention. He stepped down for the consensus candidate, Emma Enukwu.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, Mr Nnamani was appointed a member of the 12-member Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC to represent the South-east zone.",

          "text": "In a bid to have section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 deleted, President Muhammadu Buhari has enlisted the services of five Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) to battle the fierce legal battle instituted against him by the Peoples Democratic Party PDP on the Electoral Act dispute.\n\nThe five SANs are Chief Oladipupo Okpeseyi, renowned Professor of law, Yemi Akinseye George, Abdul Atadoga Ibrahim, Tijani Alkali Gasali and Ehiogie West-Idahosa.\n\nThe senior lawyers are mandated to fortify the position of the Presidency that section 84 (12) of the 2022 Electoral Act is unconstitutional, null and void and should be deleted.\n\nAlready, Buhari, through the legal team being coordinated by Okpeseyi SAN has filed a Preliminary Objection suit against the PDP suit seeking its outright dismissal on the ground that the suit failed to disclose any cause of action against him.\n\nThe President who is the 1st and major defendant in the court action labelled PDP as a busy body seeking to take over the constitutional functions of the National Assembly through the back door.\n\nHe had on Thursday at the Federal High Court filed a joint counter-affidavit alongside the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) to debunk all allegations made against them by the party.\n\nIn the new process, Buhari told the court that PDP was registered as a political party but now seeking to take over the functions of the Senate on law-making and law amendment.\n\nHe asked the court to resist the temptation of granting the request of the PDP so as not to impede the growth of democratic governance in the country.\n\nBuhari\u2019s preliminary objection against the suit was predicated on two major grounds among which are that the suit is incompetent as it does not disclose any reasonable cause of action thereby robbing the court of jurisdiction.\n\nHe claimed that the suit of the plaintiff is premature as there is nothing before the court showing the existence of any cause of action.\n\nThe President also hinged his call for the dismissal of the suit on the reason that it discloses no wrongful act against him or any injury suffered by PDP or any damage likely to be suffered by the party if the Electoral Act\u2019s section 84 (12) is deleted.\n\nGround two of the objection was premised on abuse of court process in view of a judgment by the same court in Umuahia delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike on March 18 in suit No FHC/UM/CS/26/2022 which nullified and set aside section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIn the bid to justify his request for dismissal of PDP\u2019S suit, Buhari cited section 240 of the 1999 Constitution which forbids the Federal High Court from sitting as an Appeal Court on its own decisions.\n\nA copy of the preliminary objection sighted showed it was endorsed by Oladipupo Okpeseyi SAN on the authority of President Buhari and has been served on parties in the suit for hearing on May 16 by Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo.",

          "text": "\u2026APC\u2019ll win Ekiti governorship poll, he boasts \u2026Assures of free, fair primaries\n\nThe chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has said the governing party was yet to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 elections.\n\nSenator Adamu stated this Friday in Abuja while speaking to State House Correspondents after presenting the party\u2019s candidate for the Ekiti state governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBlueprint reports that Senator Adamu was accompanied to the Presidential Villa by the Ekiti state governor and chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Kebbi state governor and chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Atiku Bagudu, and the national secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore.\n\nWhen asked where the governing would be zoning its presidential ticket to, Adamu said taking such a decision would be the job of the entire party which, according to him, is bigger than himself as chairman.\n\n\u201cI am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party decision will be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF) had, on Thursday, asked major political parties to throw the contest for their presidential tickets open to all regions, asserting that the zoning system is no longer desirable.\n\nThe ruling party had swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North Central as the national chairman.\n\nResignation of appointees\n\nOn the intense issue of when political appointees who intend to run for elective offices were expected to resign their current appointments, considering the party\u2019s recently issued guidelines for those in that category, the party\u2019s national chair merely noted that the matter was already in court.\n\n\u201cThank you very much for your question. Our luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it will be subjudice for me to discuss it at all,\u201d he said.\n\nNomination, EoI forms\n\nWhen asked about the high cost of the party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, he said the party had no regrets setting the prices at the current rate.\n\nHe cited the need to protect the party from non-serious aspirants and moles as well as the need to generate money to run the election processes.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through presidential campaign, and go through election for the President. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contest, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheap by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win presidential election in Nigeria; they will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention, whichever party is involved in that.\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from, If God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million; it\u2019s no news.\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression. When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it took him N500, 000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million to contest.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue going a begging.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win election. Some protests may be well founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume \u2018it\u2019s the ruling party,\u2019 is a quick\u2026 in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI will not quarrel with that; everyone of us has the right to express himself, and I\u2019m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where they pinch us the most one.\u201d\n\nPossible fracas\n\nAllaying the fears that the process of settling for a presidential candidate could tear the party apart, if not carefully handled, Adamu said: \u201cGod will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out by the grace of God. At the appropriate time, the candidate at the convention for our great party will choose.\n\n\u201cI do not want to speculate, but my duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes and I\u2019ve always found it easier and more noble to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not yet there,\u201d he said.\n\nOptimism on Ekiti gov\u2019ship poll\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Adamu has expressed optimism that the party would win the forthcoming Ekiti state gubernatorial election scheduled to take place in June this year.\n\nAdamu said this Friday in Abuja when he formally presented the APC candidate for the election to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe came to present Mr Abiodun Abayomi Oyebanji, who is the gubernatorial candidate of our great party the APC in the forthcoming election of 18th June, 2022. He emerged successful after a very thorough and transparent primary election.\n\n\u201cWe came to present him for the President\u2019s blessings and for the President; the father and leader of our party to formally present the flag of our great party the APC to him and that has just been done. The President was so happy in receiving the candidate and by the grace of God the Governor to be for Ekiti,\u201d he said.\n\nPresidential primary\n\nAsked to comment on how the APC hopes to hold rancour free presidential primary election, the APC chairman said the process would be free and fair, culminating with the emergence of an acceptable candidate.\n\n\u201cWe will come out by the grace of God and at the appropriate time with a candidate that the convention of our great party will choose. I do not want to speculate but my duty as a party Chairman s to listen to our party men and leaders and stakeholders to see what is going to be best when the time comes,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Ahead of next year\u2019s general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described himself as the most qualified of all the 17 aspirants vying for the 2023 presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe also told the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) that he deserved the right of first refusal, given his experience and competence.\n\nBut the NWC replied it would work for all the seventeen aspirants and not him alone, urging the former VP and others in the race to sell themselves to the delegates.\n\nA similar response was given to Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike who asked the NWC to pay him for his support and role in ensuring their emergence, and also provide level playing field for all aspirants.\n\nAnd in his response, the PDP national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, told the governor to settle for either of the two options, saying he cannot have the two all to himself alone.\n\nThe aspirants\n\nApart from Atiku and Wike, the rest presidential aspirants seeking the party\u2019s ticket at the National Convention slated for 28 and 29 May are: former Senate President Bukola Saraki; former Anambra Governor Peter Obi and Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nAlso included are former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Anyim Pius Anyim; Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed and Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel.\n\nOthers are renowned industrialist, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa; Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; a United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Ovation Magazine publisher, Dele Momodu, former Ekiti state Governor Ayo Fayose; Cosmos Ndukwe, Mr Charles Ugwu, Chikwendu Kalu and Tariele Diana Oliver.\n\nAtiku visits NWC\n\nSpeaking Thursday during his visit to the National Working Committee (NWC) members of the party in Abuja, the 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP also said with the 11 million votes he garnered in the last election, he deserved the right of first refusal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you what I am, what qualifications I have, what experience I have, and what I can do for this party, for this country,\u201d he told the party leaders.\n\nThe Waziri Adamawa pledged that if elected, he would reunite the country, deal decisively with security issues and revamp the economy.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman and members of the National Working Committee, I\u2019m really not here to lecture you, I\u2019m just really here to inform you of my decision to run again, and also to urge you to provide the right kind of leadership so that the best candidate can emerge.\n\n\u201cAnd I dare say Mr Chairman, I am the best candidate. Under normal circumstances Mr Chairman, this is a guy who has already 11 million votes in his kitty. And I think, as a party, you should give me the right of first refusal but we are in a democracy.\n\n\u201cAll I can urge you is to make sure that the way you have started, you also conclude the way you have started by being very fair, very credible, giving every contestant the opportunity to face the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the performance of the incumbent administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by President Muhammadu Buhari, Atiku said, \u201cevery Nigeria knows that the APC has failed but we should not take Nigerians for granted.\n\n\u201cWe should go all out to let them know APC has failed, it will continue to fail. No matter what gap they have come or they appear to be, they will continue to fail and PDP has not failed on your comparative analysis. If you compare the achievements of PDP and the failure of APC, you know that you have no other choice than PDP,\u201d he stated.\n\nAyu\n\nIn his reaction, the PDP national chairman, Senator Ayu, said he won\u2019t work for Atiku alone, but all the 17 aspirants.\n\n\u201cMr Vice President, I will not work for you as an aspirant. I will work for all the 17 aspirants. It is left to you to convince the delegates of our party that you are the best. You have to market yourself, you have to work hard,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nAyu, who assured that the NWC would not take side with any particular aspirant, urged all aspirants to convince the delegates and market themselves.\n\nThe PDP boss said: \u201cLet me take time to explain to Nigerians that the party has its internal mechanisms of selecting a candidate, whether by consensus or by-election, we will do it transparently.\n\n\u201cThose who love our party more than us should please tarry a little, they should not select candidates for the People\u2019s Democratic Party. They don\u2019t have our mandate and we will not concede that mandate to anybody, young or an elder who chooses by himself to choose a candidate for us.\n\n\u201cOur internal processes will go ahead and we are going ahead with it. At the end of the day, we\u2019ll come up with a candidate chosen by the members of the People\u2019s Democratic Party themselves. It is that candidate that will present to the rest of Nigeria for the forthcoming elections\u201d.\n\nScreening\n\nMeanwhile, there is palpable tension over the screening of the 17 PDP presidential aspirants as the David Mark-led committee meets today (Friday) to evaluate the contestants.\n\nAccording to the schedule of activities released by the National Organising Secretary, Hon. Umar Bature, the national convention is slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nThe screening exercise holds at Legacy House, Abuja, the party\u2019s presidential campaign headquarters.\n\nBlueprint reports that PDP Deputy National Publicity Secretary Ibrahim Abdullahi, who stood in for the national chairman at a function in Abuja recently, had hinted that the party would throw its 2023 presidential ticket open.\n\nHe had said: \u201cWell, for the opportunity that are available, and to provide equal opportunity for Nigerians to bid for the available political offices, those who are interested in pursuing for the presidency, we are opening it for every Nigerians to pursue. What it implies as we speak, every Nigerian is bidding from the south-east, from the south-west, and from the north, no section of Nigeria is denied an opportunity to contest or aspire.\u201d\n\nAnd further to this, the party\u2019s national chairman, last month, said the PDP has a history of rotating offices among various components making up Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, PDP has a history of rotating our offices. Anybody who doesn\u2019t get it this time should wait after the tenure of whoever will be our next President,\u201d Ayu had said.\n\nOrtom committee\n\nConsequently, the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) swiftly inaugurated a 37- man zoning committee led by Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom on the 24th of March, 2022.\n\nThe committee was to recommend to the party whether zoning would help it return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and that which part of the country to zone the presidency to.\n\nAfter 3 consecutive meetings and upon submitting its report 2 weeks ago, controversy continues to trail the committee\u2019s recommendation that the committee recommended that the 2023 ticket be thrown open.\n\nBut Governor Ortom debunked the report, saying their position would be made known by the party\u2019s NEC which gave them the assignment.\n\nConsensus\n\nAnd in their separate but collective efforts, the quartet of Tambuwal, Bala, Saraki and Hayatu-Deen, had traversed the length and breadth of the country championing the consensus arrangement.\n\nHowever, the arrangement collapsed when the duo of Bala and Saraki from the north-east and north-central respectively, were announced by a committee of northern leaders as presidential aspirants within the party.\n\nAs this continues to generate acrimony among the 4 aspirants and other aspirants from the north, many stakeholders have expressed fear that the party\u2019s position on zoning could negatively impact its performance in the general elections.\n\nTension\n\nThe struggle for the ticket is generating tension among party stakeholders, some of whom warned that zoning it to the North would be an injustice against the South and that this would come with some consequences.\n\nAlso, others cautioned that zoning the presidency to the South cannot help the party bounce back to its winning ways in 2023.\n\nPolitical pundits observed that tension is high in the party because whatever decision the party took can make or mar its chances in the forthcoming 2023 election.\n\nOthers also warned that if not well managed, it might lead to an implosion within the PDP.\n\nThe duo of Anyim and former PDP Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, had warned that any attempt to jettison the zoning arrangement would affect the party\u2019s chances in 2023.\n\nWhile Saraki insisted that it\u2019s the turn of the North Central to produce the next president, Tambuwal said zoning to the South won\u2019t guarantee the PDP victory in the election.\n\nWe\u2018re up to the task \u2013 Ologunagba\n\nIn an interview with Blueprint, PDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba dismissed the view that zoning and the contest for the party\u2019s ticket by the 17 aspirants may drag the party into an internal crisis.\n\nOn the party\u2019s position on zoning, he said, the party would make this known at the right time.\n\nThe PDP publicity scribe also assured that the national convention and congresses to elect the party\u2019s candidates for all positions would be free, fair, credible and transparent.\n\nHe said:\u201dPeople are in a hurry and concerned about our party\u2019s position on zoning because the PDP is the hope of Nigerians, the PDP will rescue and rebuild the country. Our position on zoning will be made known through the NEC at the right time.\n\n\u201cThe number of aspirants won\u2019t lead the party into any internal crisis during or even after the national convention. In any case, the PDP has an internal conflict resolution mechanism capable of resolving any issue.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we will ensure the party\u2019s national convention and even congress at all levels to elect party\u2019s candidate for all position is free, fair and credible.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026Gross profit hits N48.8bn, rising by 122.3%\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and the London Stock Exchange, announces its unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7bn from N10.6bn year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4bn from N1.7bn year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6bn from N57.9bn year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8bn from N20.1bn year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nIn its operations, Seplat Energy demonstrated a strong safety record, which extended to 26.1 million hours without LTI from operated assets (2.0 million hours in Q1 2022).\n\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis. The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\n\n\u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote has said on Wednesday that women entrepreneurs in the Nigerian oil and gas industry should break barriers by taking advantage of the $40m fund created specifically for them under the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund, NCI Fund.\n\nWabote spoke at the annual general meeting of the Oil and Gas Trainers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, OGTAN, held in Abuja with the theme \u201cDiversity & Inclusiveness in Human Capital development for the Energy Sector.\u201d\n\nNoting that that unavailability of funds was one of the key challenges that often hinder the participation of women in the oil and gas activities, the Executive Secretary stated that the Board had addressed the issue through the NCI Fund.\n\n\u201cTo provide a fair chance for women in the oil and gas industry, the Board partnered with the NEXIM Bank to establish a $20 million fund that was matched with an additional $20 million fund by NEXIM bank, making the total pool of funds available to women in oil and gas to be $40 million,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the Board and its partners have introduced and implemented several initiatives that promote diversity in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSome of those gender-focused interventions were being implemented in partnership with the Bank of Industry, BoI, while others were facilitated by the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, he added.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary, another step taken by the Board to drive diversity in oil and gas activities was the setting up of the Diversity Sectorial Group in the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Board has also organized events that were targeted at women and community activities to promote inclusiveness.\n\nHe mentioned that NCDMB\u2019s efforts to lead the womenfolk into the mainstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry was recognized at the 5th Nigerian International Energy Summit this year when the agency was bestowed with an award of the \u201cBest Gender Support Company in the Energy Space\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Human Capacity Development, the NCDMB boss explained that it adds significant value to the energy sector, and contributes to developing local content in the energy sector.\n\nHe also confirmed that the Board\u2019s Human Capacity Development model has no gender bias as it was inclusive and provides equal opportunities to all applicants and beneficiaries.\n\nHe hinted that NCDMB had put in place the 60-20-20 training model in which 60 percent of the training resources provided by the Board and the industry are devoted to providing young Nigerians with specialized skills they need to secure employment.\n\nHe stated that \u201cunder this component of the model, beneficiaries are provided with qualitative skills and international certifications that will position them for employment within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that 20 percent of the training spend was geared towards improvement in the productivity of already employed personnel while another 20 percent of spend on training is used for trainings on soft skills.\n\nThe Executive Secretary assured that the Board will continue to develop female members of staff to occupy key positions in preparation for higher leadership roles as well as continue to promote Human Capacity Development across various spheres of the energy sector, including skill development and entrepreneurship programs and STEM development across secondary and tertiary institutions to prepare youths for the future.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja in Appeal No. CA/ABJ/CV/269/2022 in the case between the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) vs Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim has ruled that all proceedings including the contempt proceedings initiated by Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and co at the trial court should be stayed pending the hearing, and determination of the substantive appeal.\n\nThe application for stay was argued on behalf of AMCON by their defence counsel A.U. Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings order, which he obtained under questionable circumstances.\n\nRecall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation owe the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried all reasonable and peaceful resolution strategies to recover the debt from Jimoh Ibrahim to no avail.\n\nAs a responsible debt recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, AMCON approached the Federal High Court (FHC) in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 to seek justice, and accordingly received an order of the trial court to take over the businesses of Jimoh Ibrahim. AMCON further received the backing of the trial court to appoint a Receiver/Manager to oversee the businesses on behalf of AMCON.\n\nFollowing the trial court\u2019s ruling, Jimoh Ibrahim, claimed that he was directed by the court on March 9, 2022, to commence contempt proceedings against the Executive Management of AMCON, which led AMCON to challenge the said ruling by filling Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeal on March 14, 2022.\n\nThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the outstanding N69.4billion debt owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.",

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nNigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has commenced the process of conducting a study to assess the current level of competition in the colocation and infrastructure sharing, CIS, segment of the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\nAccording to NCC, seventy-eight licensees are currently operating in that market segment.\n\nThe study is to enable the Commission to have insightful and evidenced-based facts to glean the dynamics at play and ensure the continuous growth of the CIS segment of the telecom market.\n\nThe NCC takes this issue as priority in view of the critical role played by the colocation and infrastructure sharing segment of the telecom ecosystem in ensuring robust services.\n\nAlready, the Commission has engaged the services of Messrs. Price Waterhouse Cooper, PwC, one of the world\u2019s reputable consulting firms, to conduct the study on its behalf, in exercise of NCC\u2019s regulatory functions as provided in the Nigerian Communications Act, NCA, 2003. The study is expected to be concluded between April and July, 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the NCC\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 forum recently organised in Lagos on the commencement of the study, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economy Analysis, PCEA, at NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, who represented the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the forum was hosted to intimate operators in the CIS segment of the telecom market on the study and to secure their buy-in and cooperation with the consultants undertaking the study.\n\nAkinloye reasoned that, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services, the NCC periodically conducts studies to assess the level of competition in the industry.\n\n\u201cHaving successfully conducted competition assessment studies in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the Commission had issued determinations based on the findings of the studies while outcome of such studies has also enabled the Commission to come up with various regulatory interventions and initiatives to continuously provide a level-playing field for the interplay of market forces. These procedures are emplaced by the Commission to ensure fair, efficient and sustainable competition in the Nigerian telecom industry.\u201d\n\nDespite the measurable progress made by the Commission, Akinloye stated that, since the successful completion of the 2013 study, there had been significant development and activities in some market segments of the industry that had necessitated the conduct of another competition study.\n\nFor instance, at the time the 2013 study was conducted, the CIS market segment was still at embryonic stage and as such, much emphasis was not placed on it. However, \u201cThe CIS segment has recorded significant growth and transformation over the years having about 80 licensees, operating in the segment while its performance and activities continue to impact significantly on other segments of the Nigerian industry. The Director PCEA also informed that activities in the CIS market have also attained the targets set out in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025)\u201d.\n\nAkinloye further declared that the overarching objective of the study is to provide current insights into the level of competition in the CIS market segment and articulate strategies to enhance opportunities in the market, as well as ensure the deepening of competition which will ultimately support the provision of innovative services for the benefits of both market players and the consumers at large.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with NCC\u2019s participatory approach to regulation, this initial stakeholders forum has been convened to formally introduce the project and the appointed consultants to the industry\u201d. Akinloye informed participants and asserted that the forum provides opportunities for stakeholders to gain an understanding into the objective, scope and methodology of the study, as well as to ensure that questionnaire or Request for Information (RFI) developed by the consultants to access the level of competition in the market are well understood.\n\nThus, Akinloye rallied the stakeholders to see the forum as an opportunity \u201cto seek and receive clarification based on presentation delivered by the consultant and to make comments on issues relating to the study. She urged all participants to \u201ccommit to the objectives of the study, by providing complete, timely feedback to questionnaires.\u201d\n\nDirector, Technical Standards and Network Integrity at NCC, Bako Wakil, also joined Akinloye in seeking the full cooperation of licensees in the CIS segment of the telecom market whenever they are approached by the consultants for relevant information either through the instrumentality of the RFI or through one-on-one sessions with consultants in the course of the implementation of the study.\n\nAccording to Wakil, the study is in the interest of the CIS licensees, other players and the consumers. It will also provide the Commission with useful and evidenced-based insights necessary to ensure healthy competition and a level-playing ground in the CIS segment and ensure sustainability in the growth of the telecommunication industry.\n\n\u201cAlso, rest assured of the confidentiality of any information provided to the Commission in the course of this study, no matter how sensitive,\u201d Bako said to the enthusiastic audience.\n\nEarlier in her presentation to telecom stakeholders at the event, Partner at PwC, Mary Iwelumo, amplified the voice of the Commission on the objectives of the study and urged them to cooperate with the firm in providing accurate, timely and adequate responses to the RFI or the questionnaire that would be administered. This will ensure that appropriate information are to obtained to address the challenges in the sector.",

          "text": "John Jones is the sort of voter that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cannot afford to lose \u2013 but already has.\n\nJones, who backed Johnson\u2019s Conservatives at the national election three years ago when the party swept to a landslide victory, regrets his decision after the prime minister broke his own coronavirus lockdown laws to attend alcohol-fuelled gatherings in his Downing Street office.\n\nThe 75-year-old retired hospital supplies manager said he won\u2019t vote Conservative again until Johnson has gone.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely disgusted at the way he has behaved,\u201d Jones told Reuters in the market town of Newcastle-under-Lyme in central England, a key battleground in local authority elections being held next week.\n\n\u201cI have had enough of watching him act like a clown. You only have to look at his haircut and the way he dresses to realise that he is not taking this job seriously.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Johnson upended conventional British politics by winning in both the traditional Conservative southern heartlands and more industrial areas in central and northern England.\n\nBut his support has waned as the government grapples with a cost-of-living crisis and revelations about his conduct.\n\nNow many Conservative lawmakers are wondering if he is still an electoral asset, and a poor showing in local elections next Thursday might provoke a leadership challenge.\n\nOne of the most closely watched contests will be Newcastle-under-Lyme, about 170 miles northwest of London.\n\nThe Brexit-backing town, once known for coal and steel, was traditionally a stronghold for the main opposition Labour Party, but the Conservatives won the parliamentary seat in 2019 for the first time in a century, and outright control of the council for the first time ever last year.\n\nLabour councillor David Grocott said he had found widespread anger that senior government officials were partying while the public were obeying strict rules which meant some could not say farewell to loved ones dying in hospital.\n\n\u201cEverybody is allowed to make mistakes, we are all human, but I think the hard thing is he has not broken the rules one time, but multiple times,\u201d said Grocott, who was unable to see his father in hospital before he died from COVID in 2020.\n\nTrevor Johnson, a local Conservative councillor who is standing for re-election, admitted some voters were angry but said the backlash was not as severe as he had feared.\n\n\u201cI think he can bounce back,\u201d he said. Johnson\u2019s name and photo were conspicuous by their absence from his pamphlets.\n\nFOCUS ON UKRAINE\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll after Johnson was fined, almost 80% thought he had lied about parties, while other surveys show the public overwhelmingly think he should resign.\n\nJohnson says he is focused on the major crises of the day \u2013 the highest inflation in three decades and the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn Crawley, a town south of London which has a Conservative member of parliament (MP) but whose council is evenly split, the issue was a key factor for some voters.\n\nTerrina Joughin, 58, a live-in carer, who had to prevent family members from entering homes when her patients died of COVID, is disgusted. \u201cI used to vote Conservative, I don\u2019t even vote at all now because I can\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother Conservative voter Juliet Shenton, 61, also wants Johnson gone. \u201cAre they lying to us about other things?\u201d she asked?\n\nThe prime minister and his supporters will hope such discontent is not widespread, and he remains popular with some.\n\nJohn Lathbury, 86, said he couldn\u2019t care less about parties and would continue to vote Conservative, while Merry Farr, 77, said \u201cBoris\u201d needed to stay and stand up to Russia.\n\nHOW LOW CAN JOHNSON GO?\n\nThe key question will be how bad results need to be for Conservative MPs, a number of whom have already voiced discontent, to turn on Johnson.\n\nElections are being held in local authorities across Wales and Scotland, and mainly in towns and metropolitan areas of England, including London which is already dominated by Labour.\n\nOf almost 7,000 seats being contested, Labour are defending far more than the Conservatives in England.\n\nAn analysis by pollster Find Out Now and political consultancy Electoral Calculus suggested the Conservatives could lose some 800 council seats and Labour could gain control of about 20 councils including Newcastle-under-Lyme and Crawley.\n\nA poor performance in local elections can presage the ousting of an unpopular prime minister. Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May lost some 1,330 seats in May 2019 and in a month announced she would step down.\n\nAcademics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher say a loss of 350 Conservative seats would be bad for the Conservatives but losses might be limited by a lack of enthusiasm for Labour under leader Keir Starmer, whose own position could be under pressure if his party is seen to have underperformed.\n\n\u201cAll he does is slag Boris off and jumps on any bandwagon,\u201d said Jill Jordan, an antiques dealer in Newcastle-under-Lyme who previously voted Labour. \u201cStarmer doesn\u2019t appear to have any ideas of his own. That is not leadership.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Ukraine Says Russia Taking \u2018Colossal Losses\u2019 in Eastern Battle",
          "text": "Ukraine acknowledged on Friday it was taking heavy losses in Russia\u2019s assault in the east, but said Russia\u2019s losses were even worse, as U.S. President Joe Biden called on Congress to send as much as $33 billion to help Kyiv withstand the attack.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised Biden\u2019s offer of help, which amounts to nearly 10 times the aid Washington has sent so far since the war began on Feb. 24.\n\nIn Kyiv, workers were cleaning up rubble in a residential area after Russia fired two missiles at the capital during a visit on Thursday by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, which Ukraine called an attack on the United Nations itself.\n\nHaving failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nUkraine has acknowledged losing control of some towns and villages there since the assault began last week, but says Moscow\u2019s gains have come at a massive cost to a Russian force already worn down from its earlier defeat near the capital.\n\n\u201cWe have serious losses but the Russians\u2019 losses are much much bigger\u2026They have colossal losses,\u201d presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nBy pledging tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine, Biden has dramatically increased U.S. involvement in the conflict. The United States and its allies are now sending heavy weapons including artillery, with what Washington says is an aim not just to repel Russia\u2019s attack but to weaken its armed forces so it cannot menace its neighbours again.\n\n\u201cWe need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe cost of this fight \u2013 it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 but caving to aggression is going to be more costly.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy tweeted: \u201cThank you @POTUS and the American people for their leadership in supporting Ukraine in our fight against Russian aggression. We defend common values \u2013 democracy and freedom. We appreciate the help. Today it is needed more than ever!\u201d\n\nRussia has said the arrival of Western arms into Ukraine means it is now fighting a \u201cproxy war\u201d against NATO. President Vladimir Putin threatened unspecified retaliation this week, while his foreign minister warned of a threat of nuclear war.\n\nMISSILES HIT KYIV\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s office said Russia was pounding the entire front line in the eastern Donetsk region with rockets, artillery, mortar bombs and aircraft. The Ukrainian general staff said Russia was shelling positions along the line of contact to prevent the Ukrainians from regrouping.\n\nBritain said fighting had been particularly heavy around the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, the main part of the Donbas that Russia is still trying to capture, with an attempted advance south from Russian-held Izium towards Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cDue to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces,\u201d the British defence ministry said in an update.\n\nThe bloodiest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war have been in Mariupol, an eastern port reduced to a wasteland by two months of Russian bombardment and siege.\n\nUkraine says 100,000 civilians are still in the city, which is mostly occupied by Russia. Hundreds of civilians are holed up with last remaining defenders in underground bunkers beneath a huge steel works.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s office said an operation was planned on Friday to get civilians out of the plant, giving no details.\n\nIn the capital, normal life has largely returned after weeks in which residents were forced to shelter in metro stations from bombardment. The front line, which come right to the outskirts of Kyiv in March, is now hundreds of miles away. Foreign dignitaries have been flying in to pay their respects to Zelenskiy and his government.\n\nBut Russia can still hit the city with long range missiles, as it did on Thursday, during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres, in what Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov called \u201can attack on the security of the Secretary General and on world security\u201d.\n\nNo one was killed but at least four people were wounded in the missile strike in the capital, which blew out windows and scattered rubble across the streets.\n\n\u201cKyiv is still a dangerous place and Kyiv is still the target of Russians, of course. The capital of Ukraine is the goal and they want to occupy it,\u201d Mayor Vitali Klitschko said, supervising the cleanup.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres visited Borodianka, one of the Kyiv suburbs that Russia had occupied in March, leaving dead bodies in the ruined streets when its forces withdrew.\n\n\u201cI imagine my family in one of those homes, now destroyed and black. I see my granddaughters running away in panic, part of the family eventually killed,\u201d Guterres told reporters in Borodianka, surrounded by scorched, windowless apartment blocks.\n\n\u201cInnocent civilians were living in these buildings, they were paying the highest price for a war which they have not contributed to at all.\u201d\n\nReuters",
