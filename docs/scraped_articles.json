          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nThe lead Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Dr. Joseph Okoeguale, has warned women against inserting ice cream into their vagina and injecting seasoning cubes into their buttocks.\n\nDr. Okoeguale also warned against inserting potash alum and other chemicals into the vagina, noting that those engaging in such practices are putting their health at risk.\n\nWomen who indulge in the practice of putting different substances in their vagina claim that such practice boosts sexual pleasure and fertility. They also believe that injecting certain substances in their buttocks can equally help increase their buttocks size.\n\nHowever, the expert says there is no scientific proof supporting their claims.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Okoeguale warns that these methods have the potentials to cause ulcers and infections in the genitals.\n\nOkoeguale, who is also the Deputy Director, Institute of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever and Emergent Pathogens at ISTH, said his unit has admitted and treated many women with severe burns and ulcers in their genitals, after using chemicals for the genitals.\n\n\u201cIce-cream is full of sugary and carbohydrate substances and it may encourage the growth of microorganisms within the vagina. This may increase vaginal discharges and even bacterial growth because some of them may become contaminated and they introduce it into the vagina.\n\n\u201cSome of them introduce ice cream during sexual intercourse; the man may pour ice cream into his mouth and pour it into the woman\u2019s vagina. So, the microorganism within the mouth \u2013 mixed with saliva and whatever thing is in the mouth \u2013 will be poured into the vagina, and a lot can happen from there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think injecting seasoning cubes into the buttocks does anything. It has no benefit really; I don\u2019t understand the rationale behind that.\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone do that? There will be complications for such action,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said women who use medicated soaps, alum, and other chemicals or substances to douche are also at risk of having vaginal discharges, scars, and pains during sexual intercourse.\n\n\u201cSome people use different types of chemicals just to make the vagina tight for more sexual pleasure during sexual intercourse; but as experts, we discourage it.\n\n\u201cFor them, they just want the vagina to be extra clean, they feel they perceive some very bad odour in the vagina so they use medicated soap to wash the vagina, which is wrong because there are good bacteria called lactobacillus, which help to keep the vagina healthy, serving as a defence and preventing harmful infections to the vagina.\n\n\u201cWhen people use those medicated soaps to wash the vagina, they are prone to having vaginal discharges; and that is why we tell people not to use medicated soaps to wash inside the vagina.\n\n\u201cBy the time they use alum and medicated soaps to clean all those required microorganisms, the person starts having a lot of discharges.Some people may even have irritations around the vagina.So it\u2019s not advisable at all. We usually encourage people to just use water, even without soap, to clean.\n\n\u201cWhat other people also do is to use potassium alum.They push it into the vagina to tighten it and it becomes narrow but the problem is that the vagina capacity can be so small and it will affect the ability to deliver in the future.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it may even become so narrow that the person begins to have serious pain during sexual intercourse.\n\n\u201cWe have admitted some women in our unit that have severe burns within the genital tract and ulcers visible everywhere because they put some chemicals into the vagina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also common among people who are trying to conceive. They meet native doctors who give them herbs to push inside the vagina and it can lead to ulcer, gynatresia, and infection in the vagina,\u201d Okoeguale said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "...Alleges conspiracy as hospital demands N.6m to admit him, denies him oxygen\n\n\u2026.How Doctor on duty frustrated foreign consultant to attend to him\n\n\u2026.Laments his death a dark day for region, entire Nigeria\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum, MBF, Sunday, gave an account of how an activists and former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia lost battle to a yet to be disclosed ailment early hours of Sunday at the Specialist hospital, Gwagwalada, in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja.\n\nThe Forum, in the statement issued by Dr. Isuwa Dogo, its National Publicity Secretary, which a copy was obtained by Vanguard in Abuja, alleged conspiracy, lackadaisical attitudes of medical personnel as responsible for the untimely death of the presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, in the 2019 general elections.\n\nThe statement reads; \u201dThe death of the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital Gwagwalada, Abuja, this morning came to us as a great shock.\n\n\u201dAs someone who relentlessly participated in the activities of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), his untimely death has dealt a deadly blow on ethnic nationalities of not only the Middle Belt but the country at large.\n\n\u201dArising from various enquiries from Nigerians over the circumstances of his death, the Forum wishes to state as follows: That Dr Mailafia arrived Abuja last Sunday September 12, 2021 from Akure and was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by his wife.\n\n\u201dOn arrival at home, the wife noticed he was not in the best of health conditions and seemed to be suffering from malaria. After three days of treatment without signs of improvement, he went to the CBN Hospital on Friday September 17, 2021 where he was shabbily treated. It took the intervention of a senior medic who immediately placed him on oxygen and admitted him.\n\n\u201dDr Mailafia\u2019s was later given the option of choosing three hospitals: Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital and EHA Clinics. The wife opted for the third choice. On arrival at the EHA Clinics, the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him.\n\n\u201dAfter few hours of treatment, the EHA Clinics told the wife that it was expedient to transfer the former CBN Deputy Governor to Gwagwalada as the clinic was not fully equipped to handle the case.\n\n\u201dThe wife opposed the decision and insisted that she was opposed to the idea of taking her husband to Gwagwalada. Mailafia\u2019s wife only succumbed when the consultant assured her that nothing bad will happen to her husband.\n\n\u201dYesterday, Saturday September 18, 2021, Dr Obadiah was transferred to Gwagwalada. On arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr Mailafia was not on duty. Even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring nothing goes wrong.\n\n\u201dWife of the former CBN Deputy Governor was asked to pay the sum of N600\u2019000 as deposit even when it was a referral case, with accruing medical bill to be settled by the CBN. At a point, Dr Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him in a ventilator. The doctors flatly refused.\n\n\u201dEven after the doctors declared Dr. Mailafia dead, foreign consultants who were brought into the matter through Dr Mailafia\u2019s son that is living abroad, had directed a family member who is a medical professional, with the wife of the CBN Deputy Governor, to mount pressure on the chest of Dr. Mailafia for resuscitation and thereafter place him on a life support.\n\n\u201dThe doctors in Gwagwalada refused all entreaties by the family members of Dr Mailafia to follow the advice of the foreign consultants, insisting that they have already pronounced him dead.\n\n\u201dEven when the wife could feel the pulse of her husband, the doctor flatly declared there was nothing they could do since they had already pronounced him dead.\n\n\u201dWhile the above narration sums up the circumstances under which Dr Mailafia died, we still await the result of the actual cause of his death. As a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression.\n\n\u201dThe economist was never afraid to speak truth to power just as he remained committed to the enthronement of justice and equity to all citizens across ethnic and religious divides.\n\n\u201dIn the twilight of his life, this consummate technocrat and global scholar of repute beamed his searchlight on the raging insecurity ravaging our country. He expressed regrets over government\u2019s incapacity to rein in the activities of insurgents and criminal groups terrorising the nation.\n\n\u201dAs a former presidential candidate in the 2019 poll, Dr Mailafia sought to deploy politics to bring about the dream he had for his country. Even after he lost the election, he never let down the bar in demanding for a fair treatment for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dThe Forum recalls his patriotic zeal in standing up for truth and justice. He was never a letdown in being at the forefront of showing the way for national greatness as he was willing to lay down his life for Nigeria.\n\n\u201dThe Forum is inspired by his altruistic disposition and contributions to national development. We remain proud of his footprints on the political, economic and social sands of our nation.\n\n\u201dIn this period of grief, we extend our sympathy to his immediate family members and pray to the Almighty God to grant each and everyone of them the fortitude to bear the pain of this irreparable loss.\n\n\u201dThe death of Dr Mailafia today represents a dark day for not only the Middle Belt but also for all citizens who yearn for a new dawn for justice in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026 NIN enrolment has accelerated, with 67% growth over the past 10 months\n\nBy Nkiruka Nnorom\n\nA research by Africa Practice Inclusion for All initiative, an advocacy programme to address the barriers that prevent the financial and economic inclusion of Nigeria\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities, has linked identity (ID) ownership to income level.\n\nThe research revealed that poor and vulnerable communities remain the least likely to have means of identification, adding that the knowledge and understanding of the barrier this creates to financial inclusion and credit is growing.\n\nThe report, however, identified that the National Identity Number (NIN) enrolment has risen over the last 10 months, growing by 67 percent within the period.\n\nThe World Bank Group estimates that 1 billion people globally are without an officially recognised means of identification, which is most prevalent in low-income countries. Despite a significant acceleration in ID enrolment over the last 12 months by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) and a robust strategy to achieve ID inclusion for every Nigerian, there remains significant work to do.\n\nNIMC had enrolled more than 63 million Nigerians with National Identity Numbers (NIN) by August 31 2021, up from 42 million in October 2020, a clear evidence of progress. However, a significant proportion of Nigerians remain without a form of formal ID, and the majority live below the World Bank\u2019s definition of the poverty line.\n\nThe Africa Practice research focuses on understanding the links that exist between income level, identity ownership and financial inclusion to identify opportunities to accelerate the pace of inclusion.\n\nAccording to the Access 2 Finance survey conducted by Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) in 2020, 36 percent of Nigerian adults remain completely financially excluded, representing 38 million people, while a total of 59 million Nigerians are unbanked. Of these, 73 percent do not have the identity documents required to open a Tier 3 bank account.\n\nThe Africa Practice research indicated that the poorer people are, the less likely they are to have an ID. It noted that the number of people that reference ID as a key barrier to opening a bank account or accessing credit, increased substantially in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe poorest excluded populations are most often the hardest to reach, and can be the most resistant to participation, but stand to gain the most from the range of government and financial services that inclusion enables,\u201d it says.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Africa Practice Director, Tim Newbold, said: \u201cThe pace of identity enrolment in Nigeria has accelerated markedly in 2020 and 2021, with more than 21 million Nigerians enrolling, and is a testament to NIMC\u2019s strategy and government\u2019s focus on the issue. We need to maintain this momentum and ensure that we support NIMC to achieve its objectives for enrolment of the populations that need it most \u2013 the excluded and the vulnerable. This will take innovation, skill and commitment, and we look forward to working closely with all stakeholders to achieve Nigeria\u2019s identity and financial inclusion goals.\u201d\n\nChinasa Collins-Ogbuo, Programme Lead for the Inclusion for All initiative, said: \u201cIt is clear that the poorer you are, the less likely you are to have ID, and that this is increasingly being recognised by Nigerians as an obstacle to accessing financial services, particularly credit. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we know that demand for formal credit amongst vulnerable communities increased. There is an opportunity here, to focus targeted interventions on those communities where demand exists, to help them participate in the formal financial system and access the credit they need. This is going to be a core focus for us going forwards.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Osun State Commissioner for Finance, Bola Oyebamiji and ex-commissioner of Home Affairs, Hon Sikiru Ayedun under the administration of Rauf Aregbesola, differed over the claim that the state received N48 billion from the Federal Government as a refund on roads.\n\nAyedun during a factional meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held at the Oranmiyan House which video was shared on social media and monitored by The Nation claimed that the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola received N48b from the Federal Government as a refund on federal roads constructed within the state.\n\nHe held that \u201cthe administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has received N48 billion from the federal government in three tranches as the money that Aregbesola used for the federal road.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the current Commissioner for Finance, Hon Bola Oyebamiji, in a statement on Saturday denied the claim of Ayedun noting it is untrue, misleading and capable of creating disharmony, strife and bad blood within the progressive family.\n\nHe also said that the total contract sum is N38 billion which is lesser than the amount the ex-commissioner claimed.\n\n\u201cThe total refund by the FG to the state as of today, in three tranches, stands at N11.9bn based on the project delivered by the contractors. The refund was expended on four road projects inherited from the previous administration as against the claim by Mr Ayedun that the refund was being used to pay full salaries to civil servants in the state.\n\nOyebamiji urged well-meaning Osun citizens to endeavour to verify all information before publication and dissemination to ensure a peaceful and healthy political atmosphere for all and sundry.\n\n\u201cThe projects in question, as of November 2018, on the average, was less than 35% completion. Available records show that the Osun State Government awarded the 29km Gbongan \u2013 Akoda dualization project in 2013 for N29bn while the 40km Osogbo \u2013 Ikirun \u2013 Ila Odo Kwara boundary was awarded for N17.5bn in the same year, making both projects amount to N46.5bn as proposed by Osun State Government.\n\n\u201cHowever, after due diligence and thorough assessment by the FG Public Procurement Agency, the contract sum was reviewed downward thus: Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road at N23bn, and Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road at N15bn respectively to carry the approved award contract sum of N38bn for all the ongoing FG roads under construction. This review was duly communicated to the Osun State Government.\n\n\u201cAs of November 2018, the contractor handling Gbongan \u2013 Akoda Road project had received a total sum of N10.2bn, out of which 3.5km of the 29km stretched road has been completed including the Gbongan Interchange and the project was at 29% completion, while the contractor handling the Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road collected a total sum of N9.2bn, with 49% completion rate.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that the Osun State Government had paid both contractors the sum of N19.4bn as of November 2018. Similarly, the total refund by the FG to the state as of today, in three tranches, stood at N11.9bn based on the project delivered by both contractors.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to state that the FG refund of N11.9bn has been judiciously utilized and ploughed back into four (4) inherited road projects embarked upon by the previous administration contrary to the unsubstantiated claims by Mr Ayedun that the refund is being used to pay full salaries to civil servants in the state.\n\n\u201cAs of today, Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project is at 36% completion stage, with 8.6km asphalt on both sides of the road. Also, the Osogbo \u2013 Ila-Odo project which was 49% in November 2018 is now at 55% completion. Oba Adesoji Aderemi Road which was equally inherited at 65% completion is at 74% now and Ilesa \u2013 Iperindo \u2013 Ipetu Ijesa road project rose from 40% to 66% completion stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also instructive to note that since the advent of the Oyetola administration, an additional 60km of the road had been reconstructed and fully completed, with another 10 township roads presently under construction. These are expected to be completed before the end of 2021, including the Iconic Olaiya flyover.\u201d",

          "text": "Peter Uzoho\n\nThe Group General Manager in charge of Shipping at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Inuwa Waya, has announced his decision to voluntarily retire from the company in December this year.\n\nAlthough the retirement of the top management staff is yet to be officially confirmed by the NNPC, it was gathered that he has already tendered his letter to proceed on voluntary retirement from the services of the corporation.\n\nFollowing the submission of the letter of his voluntary retirement, Waya has already commenced his mandatory three months pre-retirement vacation, which began on September 10.\n\nWaya personally broke the news of his decision to voluntarily exit the national oil company at a surprise birthday party organised in his honour by the staff of the Shipping Division of the corporation to mark his 58th birthday on Friday, September 10.\n\nIn a commemorative speech during the party, Waya informed the staff that after serving the corporation for over 30 years, it was time for him to head towards the exit door, by voluntarily retiring to pave the way for the younger generation to take over.\n\n\u201cFor over 30 years, I have worked and diligently served the NNPC in various capacities. Over the period, I believe I did my best to contribute my little quota towards helping the organization realize the corporate goals and objectives. But I also believe every man and woman has his or her time and season for every of his or her activities. There is a time to work; a time to play, and a time to stop work and take a deserved rest to focus on other personal dreams.\n\n\u201cI believe my time to stop public work has come, to give way to my season of rest, find the space to focus on the private practice of my law profession as a qualified lawyer. That is what I have done,\u201d Waya told the staff at the birthday party.\n\nWhile many wondered why he chose to resign, considering that he still has two years in his career to reach the mandatory official retirement age of 60 years.\n\nWaya explained to the concerned staff that it was his conviction to leave the stage not only when the ovation was loudest, but more importantly to create the opportunity for the younger generation coming behind him to take over and continue from where he has stopped, to contribute their quota to the continued development of the company.\n\nThe mandatory three months\u2019 pre-retirement notification will expire on December 11, for his final disengagement to take effect.\n\nWaya was said to have confided in some of his immediate staff during the birthday party that he would be exploring the prospects of going into farming and private law practice.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed but credible sources close to the Kano State-born lawyer hinted he may be eyeing the gubernatorial race to the office of the Kano State governor in the coming 2023 elections.\n\nWaya is a qualified lawyer and legal practitioner of many years standing.\n\nHe began his public service career with the Kano State Ministry of Justice as a state counsel in 1989.\n\nOn August 26, 1991, he left the Kano State government to join the Legal Unit of the NNPC.\n\nIn his over 30 years of meritorious service to the NNPC, he served in various departments and capacities.\n\nApart from serving as the Legal Officer in charge of Litigation, Property, Research and Corporate Law in the corporation, he was appointed the Technical Assistant to the Group General Manager, Legal Division, between 1998 and 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Waya was posted to Hyson Nigeria Limited, a joint venture between NNPC and Vitol S.A. as the Company Secretary and Legal Adviser.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, he served as the Acting Executive Director, Services, for Hyson Nigeria Limited before being redeployed as the Senior Technical Assistant to the Group Managing Director of the NNPC between 2011 and 2014.\n\nWaya was appointed the General Manager of the Tenders, Contract Administration and Petroleum Upstream Department of the NNPC, and later Acting Corporation Secretary/Legal Adviser of the Corporation.\n\nIn August 2015, he was appointed Managing Director of Hyson Nigeria Limited and the President of Carlson Bermuda Limited, the offshore arm of the NNPC crude oil joint venture company.\n\nIn March 2016, Waya was appointed the Managing Director of NNPC Trading.\n\nDuring his tenure, he successfully spearheaded the reform, transformation and consolidation into one entity the NNPC multiple joint venture trading companies, comprising at that time all the NNPC Crude Oil Trading Companies, (Napoil Limited, Carlson Bermuda Limited, Duke Oil Panama) and its service companies in the United Kingdom, Nigeria and United Arab Emirate (UAE), Hyson Nigeria Limited and Nigermed.\n\nIn March 2020, he was appointed the Group General Manager, NNPC Shipping Division, a position he occupied till his voluntary retirement on September 10.\n\nHe had also served as the coordinator of the NNPC Shipping optimisation programme, mandated to transform NNPC Shipping into a global brand capable of imbibing the culture of international best practice in its services.\n\nHis wide experience and expertise equally recommended him to be relied upon by the NNPC top management to execute a number of other concurrent assignments in line with the corporation\u2019s growth agenda.\n\nCurrently, Waya holds the Directorship of the following strategic business units, including the NNPC Retail Limited, NIDAS Marine Limited, NIDAS Shipping Service Limited (Cyprus), NIDAS Shipping Service Agency (UK) Limited and NIKORMA Shipping.\n\nHe graduated from the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria with a Bachelor of Law (LLB) degree in 1987 and was called to the Nigerian Bar in March 1989 (BL).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nTwo children who were among the 28 people that were abducted by bandits in Katoge village in Batsari Local Government Area of Katsina State have reportedly died of starvation while in captivity.\n\nThe victims were kidnapped in their ancestral home (Katoge) in April, 2021 and taken to a forest in Zamfara State by their abductors.\n\nOne of the victims, Mrs Sahura Haruna, who regained freedom after spending five months in bandits\u2019 enclaves, told journalists in Katsina that the children died as a result of starvation.\n\nShe explained that six out of the 28 abducted victims were earlier released by the hoodlums after payment of ransom by their relatives, adding that the bandits abducted her when she was five months pregnant.\n\nSahura, who gave birth to a baby girl while in captivity, was among 20 captives that escaped from the bandits\u2019 den in Zamfara forest last Thursday following the ongoing onslaught against the marauding hooligans by security operatives.\n\nShe said: \u201cLast April, some bandits abducted 28 of us in Katoge village. They released six after payment of ransom by their relatives. Two children who were among us died of hunger and severe punishment by the bandits, leaving 20 of us with them (bandits).\n\n\u201cSo, last Thursday, we were sitting with a few of the bandits who were guarding us when we heard an aircraft roving the forest and the bandits started running and that paved the way for us to escape.\n\n\u201cWe ran until we arrived at a village in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of Zamfara State where we met some security personnel who took us to Gusau town and handed us over to government officials\u201d.\n\nAccording to her, they were subjected to different kind of assaults and starvation in the hands of the bandits because their relatives failed to pay the ransom demanded.\n\nReceiving the 20 escapees in Katsina, Saturday evening, the Secretary to the State Government, Dr. Mustapha Inuwa, said they regained freedom due to the current war against their abductors and stringent security containment measures adopted by the Katsina and Zamfara state governments.\n\nHe advised the federal government and security agencies to extend similar ongoing operations in Zamfara forest to adjoining forests in Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto and other states in order to completely ward off the criminals.\n\nThe secretary to the state government, however, directed the Permanent Secretary, Cabinet and Security, to provide financial support to the rescued kidnapped victims, and the state emergency management agency (SEMA) to give them food items to cushion their hardships.\n\nThe freed captives include 10 women, eight girls, one boy and a middle-aged man and they have since been reunited with their families after medical examination by the state government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "TIMELINE: Four Staunch Critics Of Lawless Buhari-led Government Who Have Died Within Eight Months",
          "text": "Four staunch critics of the Muhammadu Buhari-led government have died in the last eight months.\n\nThey include a 2nd Republic lawmaker and popular government critic, Dr. Junaid Mohammed, who died on February 18, 2021.\n\nIn 2015, Mohammed, who trained as a medical doctor, began to take on the Buhari-led government.\n\nHe had in 2016 accused the President of running a government that is based purely on nepotism rather than merit.\n\nSee Also News Buhari's Staunch Critic, Junaid Mohammed Is Dead\n\nJunaid Mohammed\n\nThe deceased was one of the first Nigerians who stated publicly that the President\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura, had become the most influential man in Nigeria.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe most influential person in the Presidency today is one Mamman Daura who as you know, is a nephew of the President. His father was Buhari\u2019s elder brother.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Mamman Daura was the one who singlehandedly brought up Abba Kyari, the current Chief of Staff to the President. In fact, Abba Kyari knows Mamman Daura more than he knows his own father.\n\n\u201cNext, the Personal Assistant to Buhari himself is the son of Mamman Daura, next is what they call SCOP, State Chief of Protocol, and is also a son-in-law to Mamman Daura because he is married to Mamman Daura\u2019s daughter. Next, the minister they unilaterally chose, against the interest of the party and against the wishes of Sokoto people, happens to be the daughter of the younger sister of Mamman Daura\u2019s wife. Both of them are daughters of Sultan Dasuki, who was sacked by General Abacha.\n\n\u201cWe have the Aide De Camp to Buhari himself, Colonel Abubakar. He is married to the granddaughter of one of Buhari\u2019s elder sisters. Next, we have the woman who represents Kaduna in the Federal Executive Council, she is a cousin to Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai. It is well known that el-Rufai is one of the closest governors to Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cNext, we have the Minister for the Federal Capital Territory. The Minister of the FCT is the man called Musa Bello, who used to be the Managing Director of the Northern Nigeria Development Corporation, which used to be the biggest holding company that belonged to all the northern states. His only qualification to be FCT minister is the fact that his father has been Buhari\u2019s friend over the years.\n\n\u201cNow, there is a young man called Sabiu Yusuf, nicknamed Tunde \u2013 probably because of the late General Tunde Idiagbon. He is another PA to President Buhari. He is also a grandson of another sister of Buhari. This is enough to prove to you that this is shamelessly the worst form of nepotism in the history of government in Nigeria. In fact, in the history of Africa, let me make bold to assert that I have never seen any level of nepotism that has equalled or surpassed this in my entire life \u2013 I am now in my 67th year.\n\n\u201cAnother thing I also want you to know is that, Amina Zakari, who was and still a national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) representing the entire seven states in the North-West, it is being claimed that Buhari knows nothing about her appointment (before he became President); it is a lie.\n\n\u201cWhen President Goodluck Jonathan was re-organising the INEC and he was bringing in Prof. Attahiru Jega, he reached out to Buhari and asked Buhari to nominate somebody from the North-West so that that person would be a national commissioner. Of all the people in the North-West, Buhari decided to nominate his own niece, the daughter of his elder sister- Amina Zakari. She has been there; when Jega left, Buhari was determined to make her chairman, it was because of the massive backlash that he dropped the idea like hot potatoes. As we are talking today, that woman is a national commissioner which means she is one of the principal election umpires. Throughout my reading of history, political science, and social sciences generally, I have never heard of any dictator or any tyrant under any system of government whether totalitarian or fascist, appointing his own niece to conduct elections in which he was either a party or going to be a party to; Buhari has done that. The immediate younger brother to Amina Zakari is currently the Minister for Water Resources representing Jigawa State in the same Buhari government.\n\n\u201cIn addition, even though they are from Kazaure, Kazaure is contiguous to Daura. The eldest sister of both of them is now the Commissioner for Education in the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in Jigawa State. If this is not nepotism, then I don\u2019t know what is nepotism and anybody who has the guts, the brutal arrogance to appoint these relations not bothering about public opinion, about the sense of justice, about competence, then you can see that he has a very serious question to answer. There are two mysterious cases.\u201d\n\nA few months later, on April 3, the death of Yinka Odumakin, a human rights activist and critic of the Buhari-led government, was announced.\n\nYinka Odumakin\n\nOdumakin played a key role in the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) that fought the regime of General Sani Abacha after the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election.\n\nSee Also News Odumakin Will Be Difficult To Replace, Afenifere Leader, Adebanjo Says\n\nHe was also one of the spokespersons of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), the body representing ethnic nationalities in the South-West, South-South, South-East, and the Middle Belt.\n\nOdumakin, who was married to another activist, Dr. Joe Odumakin, was one of the strongest critics of the present government.\n\nHe consistently took on the Buhari-led government over alleged impartiality and favouritism in appointment into various offices.\n\nHis voice was also very loud in condemning the activities of killer herdsmen in Yorubaland.\n\nShortly before his death, he warned the Nigerian government against arresting a Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Igboho for issuing a quit notice to the Fulani herders in Ibarapa, Oyo State and subsequently ejecting the Sarkin Fulani in Igangan.\n\nAnother vocal voice against the current administration, Barrister Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance (CAGG) died on September 18.\n\nOlusegun Bamgbose\n\nBamgbose in one of the last statements he released before his death told President Buhari to stop sleeping and hold meetings at midnight to tackle the nation\u2019s deteriorating security situation.\n\nMaking reference to the recent attack on the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), which was carried out around 1 am, he said it was obvious bandits do not sleep, wondering why Nigerian leaders should sleep comfortably while the country is on fire.\n\nHe said the bandit attack on NDA, one of Nigeria\u2019s strongest security units, has shown that the criminals have no atom of respect or fear for the Nigerian military.\n\nThe senior lawyer further pointed out that due to his constant warnings with no accompanying action, the bandits now have no atom of regard for the President.\n\nIn April 2021, the deceased also questioned the morality of Buhari to remain at the Presidential Villa.\n\nBamgbose claimed Nigerians committed a great blunder electing Buhari in 2015 but those who repeated the mistake in 2019 cannot be forgiven.\n\nExactly two days after Bamgbose died, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia was pronounced dead.\n\nMailafia\n\nThe former deputy governor, who was the Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, was a known government critic and had advocated for public sector and exchange rate reforms.\n\nMailafia had during a radio programme alleged that repentant Boko Haram members had revealed to him that a serving Northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group.\n\nVideo of Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Mailafia Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Mailafia WATCH VIDEO: Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Former CBN Deputy Governor, Mailafia\n\nEarly in September, he described the alleged 'fulanisation' of Nigeria as real, just as he disclosed that there was an ongoing plot by Buhari\u2019s administration to foist an alleged Fulani and Islamic agenda on Nigerians.\n\nMailafia had said, \u201cThe kind of Islam that is coming from Sahara is dangerous. They want to take over your land and enslave you. Christians must rise to protect it. They want to take over your land and enslave you.\n\n\u201cIn the North East alone, more than 3,000 churches have been destroyed, more than 400 priests and pastors have been killed. Last year, the CAN (Christian Association of Nigeria) chairman of Adamawa was beheaded, even after a ransom was paid. We have been told that they are so-called bandits, who should not be called bandits because bandits do not bring down military aircraft.\n\n\u201cNo bandit has the capacity to bring down military aircraft. No bandit has the power to attack Nigeria Defence Academy which is the premier institution for the training of armed forces. No bandit has the capacity to do that, only terrorists have the capacity to do that.\n\n\u201cWe are being told that these terrorists are part of the insurgency because they did these kidnappings to raise money in order to fund the insurgency.\u201d\n\nMailafia was born on December 24, 1956, in the Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nSee Also Politics \u2018They\u2019ve Killed The Man Who Spoke Truth To Power On Boko Haram, Fulani Herdsmen\u2019\u2014Reactions Trail Death Of Ex-Central Bank Boss, Mailafia\n\nHe later graduated top of his class at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 1978 with a B.Sc.\n\nMailafia was appointed deputy governor of CBN in 2005 from the African Development Bank (AfDB) where he served as the chief economist responsible for Strategic Planning and Corporate Reporting.",

There are two mysterious cases.\u201d\n\nA few months later, on April 3, the death of Yinka Odumakin, a human rights activist and critic of the Buhari-led government, was announced.\n\nYinka Odumakin\n\nOdumakin played a key role in the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) that fought the regime of General Sani Abacha after the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election.\n\nSee Also News Odumakin Will Be Difficult To Replace, Afenifere Leader, Adebanjo Says\n\nHe was also one of the spokespersons of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), the body representing ethnic nationalities in the South-West, South-South, South-East, and the Middle Belt.\n\nOdumakin, who was married to another activist, Dr. Joe Odumakin, was one of the strongest critics of the present government.\n\nHe consistently took on the Buhari-led government over alleged impartiality and favouritism in appointment into various offices.\n\nHis voice was also very loud in condemning the activities of killer herdsmen in Yorubaland.\n\nShortly before his death, he warned the Nigerian government against arresting a Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Igboho for issuing a quit notice to the Fulani herders in Ibarapa, Oyo State and subsequently ejecting the Sarkin Fulani in Igangan.\n\nAnother vocal voice against the current administration, Barrister Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance (CAGG) died on September 18.\n\nOlusegun Bamgbose\n\nBamgbose in one of the last statements he released before his death told President Buhari to stop sleeping and hold meetings at midnight to tackle the nation\u2019s deteriorating security situation.\n\nMaking reference to the recent attack on the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), which was carried out around 1 am, he said it was obvious bandits do not sleep, wondering why Nigerian leaders should sleep comfortably while the country is on fire.\n\nHe said the bandit attack on NDA, one of Nigeria\u2019s strongest security units, has shown that the criminals have no atom of respect or fear for the Nigerian military.\n\nThe senior lawyer further pointed out that due to his constant warnings with no accompanying action, the bandits now have no atom of regard for the President.\n\nIn April 2021, the deceased also questioned the morality of Buhari to remain at the Presidential Villa.\n\nBamgbose claimed Nigerians committed a great blunder electing Buhari in 2015 but those who repeated the mistake in 2019 cannot be forgiven.\n\nExactly two days after Bamgbose died, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia was pronounced dead.\n\nMailafia\n\nThe former deputy governor, who was the Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, was a known government critic and had advocated for public sector and exchange rate reforms.\n\nMailafia had during a radio programme alleged that repentant Boko Haram members had revealed to him that a serving Northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group.\n\nVideo of Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Mailafia Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Mailafia WATCH VIDEO: Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Former CBN Deputy Governor, Mailafia\n\nEarly in September, he described the alleged 'fulanisation' of Nigeria as real, just as he disclosed that there was an ongoing plot by Buhari\u2019s administration to foist an alleged Fulani and Islamic agenda on Nigerians.\n\nMailafia had said, \u201cThe kind of Islam that is coming from Sahara is dangerous. They want to take over your land and enslave you. Christians must rise to protect it. They want to take over your land and enslave you.\n\n\u201cIn the North East alone, more than 3,000 churches have been destroyed, more than 400 priests and pastors have been killed.

          "text": "If you\u2019re a fan of the Arsenal Football Club who appear to be suffering bad fortunes in the Premier League this season, there is good news from the Central Bank of Nigeria. You can now improve your team\u2019s score-line by attacking Livescores and sending \u2018experts' to take down its site. This quick-fix which has eluded seasoned pundits is the ingenuity of none other than Mr. Godwin Emefiele, the Chief Treasurer of Nigeria and apparently also, the Clown-in-Chief.\n\nIndeed, of all the inanities that have buffeted us in recent times as Nigerians, the CBN Governor\u2019s declaration of war on abokiFX, an online platform that publishes aggregated currency exchange rates for reference purposes, takes the ball. It offers insight into how our leaders in the eco-political sphere think, and we must be concerned.\n\nIt does not take an economist to unravel the apparent improbability of a non-trading platform that merely publishes exchange rates publicly sourced as being responsible for the weakening of the naira. If it were so, abokiFX would only have to publish that the naira is now at par with the dollar for it to be so. The government would not have to fight the platform and its owners but partner with them in publishing favourable even if untrue naira to dollar exchange rates to magically cause it to be so in the currency market.\n\nIn this utopia, one would be free from contemplating the role an import-based economy plays in the valuation of a country\u2019s currency; one would be free from worrying over the lop-sided chasing of dollars with naira, and be unmindful of our single-export based economy, being crude oil, whose value is decided by a global body and as such, outside the control of the Nigerian government. In that utopia, the role of fiscal policies by the government to shore up foreign reserves or scale up industry-based exports which would tip the scales of international valuation of the naira would be left out, completely ignored, and this, no doubt, are the synapses that jump around in the insulated mental world of our CBN Governor.\n\nIt is appalling that this is the mind and thinking of the man saddled with the nation\u2019s treasury and reserves. Going after an online platform and its owner for merely publishing exchange rates is shadow chasing and fighting a non-factor in the strengthening or weakening of the naira. Surely, the CBN Governor with all his learning and exposure knows this. If this is so, then the real reason for the CBN\u2019s attack on abokiFX and its owner must be because it considers its publishing to be embarrassing to the government and hopes that by bringing it down, they can save face.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is consistent with this government\u2019s approach to facts they find embarrassing and which are evidentiary of their failures or incompetence. And as such, the CBN is another successfully bastardised institution of state deployed to the purposes of regime protection as against its primary responsibility.\n\nGiven that the abysmal failure of the naira to perform favourably is a no-brainer, the CBN Governor\u2019s delusion of authority in eviscerating the owner of abokifx, going as far as deigning to arbitrarily order his prosecution, must be tempered by the reminder that executive rascality will only condemn the naira to a further plunge. The CBN and its governor are, indeed, not laws onto themselves but are beholden of it and due process.\n\nThe attack on abokiFX and its owner, no matter how stubbornly sustained, will not save the naira from its embarrassingly free fall and, I predict that many other platforms will spring up in place of, or in solidarity with abokifx. Will the CBN attack all? Anyway, the average Nigerian does not need to visit an online platform to know that the naira is fast losing value. The black marketeers under the trees at Sheraton know, travellers and traders sourcing for scarce dollars know, and the general public who have to adjust to the tripling cost of household materials and commodities know. It is to these ones that the CBN Governor owes a duty, not to insulate government from reproach but to build a spine for the crippling naira.\n\nOlajengbesi is a legal practitioner and the Principal Partner at Law Corridor Chambers, Nigeria.\n\n[email protected]",

          "text": "The University of Benin (UNIBEN) has given reasons for its decision to increase its tuition fee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast Tuesday, undergraduates at the Edo varsity had blocked off its gate to protest an increase in their school fees.\n\nLectures and other academic activities within the campus had been stalled as a deluge of students held up placards.\n\nThe protesters had lamented that the authorities increased the tuition fees for science students from N45,400 to N65,400 and that of art-related courses from N41,400 to N61,400 as a sanction for late payment and registration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter two days of protest, UNIBEN suspended the hike while students waited for the varsity\u2019s official stance on the issue.\n\nIn a conference on Friday, Liliam Salami, the vice-chancellor (VC), said the varsity senate had imposed the fine in an attempt to solve the problem of late registration by students.\n\n\u201cThis behavior continues to have a negative downstream impact on our institution\u2019s operations and ability to deliver the quality of education and students\u2019 support that I remain committed to as vice-chancellor,\u201d Salami said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cResearch shows there is a direct correlation between late registration and poor student academic performance.\n\n\u201cLess than 25% of our students register on time yearly. No functional or high-performing education institution can thrive with such lackluster statistics. Early registration is critical for the effective operations of the University.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that in the past, other non-financial interventions to urge early registration have failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn August 2, the university senate agreed to increase the existing payment of a late fee of N10,000 to N20,000 on all students who passed the due registration period as another attempt to encourage early registration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe good news is that we saw significant growth in early registrations, from last year\u2019s rate of 35% to 93%. We haven\u2019t seen this rate of early registration in decades. It is a UNIBEN record without question.\u201d\n\nVC confirms reversal of N20,000 fine, says some protesters were violent\n\nEarlier, a student had narrated to TheCable Lifestyle how the VC\u2019s security order to vacate campus was flouted.\n\nIt was also gathered that a huge number of students had stormed Salami\u2019s office to shut down her power and water supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the protest, Salami said a number of the students turned violent, endangering her and some staff.\n\n\u201cProtests and freedom of speech are a critical part of a well-functioning society. I continue to be an advocate for creating an environment where all members of the Uniben community can have a voice,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat said, while most protesting students acted peacefully, a few turned violent, endangering themselves, their fellow students, and our staff (including myself). I am glad that the protest concluded with no one being hurt.\n\n\u201cAs the Vice-Chancellor, I will continue to encourage fair, open dialogue, but violence in any shape or form has no place in UNIBEN and will not be tolerated. Freedom of speech does not and should never amount to chaos.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the VC, the reversal of the N20,000 fine is permanent following the achievement of the sanction.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the outcry from students, the senate reversed the decision to impose the late fee of N20,000. It is important to mention that this reversal in position will not break the University of Benin,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI fundamentally believe that there are very few decisions that are irreversible and this is definitely not one of them. At this time, the N20,000 late fee is reversed and it is a closed case.\n\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, my administrative team and I will reflect on the lessons learned from the last few days.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that it will shape our policies and back-end processes, how we gather the voice of the students and how we leverage technology to address these kinds of issues in the future.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "text": "Besides his romantic entanglement with Saskay, Jay Paul\u2019s stint on the sixth edition of the BBNaija was mainly dominated by winning tasks, particularly those that required creative dexterity. With the money and fame garnered from the show, Jay Paul, whose real name is Paul Ephraim, said he\u2019s determined to explore the vast world of entertainment and also intends to rebrand \u2018Made In Calabar\u2019, his lifestyle company. In this interview with TheCable Lifestyle\u2019s KUNLE DARAMOLA, the 29-year-old entertainer disclosed that he\u2019d be the happiest man on earth if Saskay agrees to have a relationship with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow has the reception been since your eviction?\n\nAmazing. I never expected it. The love has been overwhelming. There have been a lot of positive comments too. In fact, 98% of what I have heard so far falls under positivity, while the remaining 2% are from people I think I can\u2019t please. And I take the negative criticisms seriously too because it shows you where you\u2019re going wrong. I\u2019m so happy that I received more positive than negative.\n\nHow do you intend to build on your fame?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what I have been praying and working for, that the attention should come my way so that I can sell myself to the world and I\u2019m happy I used the platform I got, which is arguably the biggest platform ever to push and show what I\u2019m capable of in terms of television, music, cinematography, and business. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity and I\u2019m ready to use it well.\n\nWhat are the projects you have lined up?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m going to be doing a lot of TV shows, hosting gigs. I want to host the biggest TV shows in the country and around the world. I also want to be able to do more cinematography and shoot movies. I already shot a movie before going into the house. I will be pushing a lot of stories about Nigeria and Africa as a whole.\n\nAnd also, I\u2019m going to be dropping music. I\u2019ll be utilising my talents a lot, and I think that\u2019s the definition of a reality TV star. Aside from the fact that I have a business before I went into the house, I co-own a lifestyle company called \u2018Made In Calabar. What we want to do is push the Calabar culture to the world, as a Calabar boy.\n\nMany say you didn\u2019t advertise your brand while in the house, what do you have to say about this?\n\nAside from the Saskay thing, I\u2019m sure people know I won most of the tasks in the house and I excelled in a lot of presentations. Anything that had to do with oratory, I excelled. I was one of the highest in terms of winning tasks, so I definitely did sell myself. Like I always say, music is just a small element in a compound that makes Jaypaul. So I did sell myself and showed the world that this guy has a smart brain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou and Saskay shared an obvious mutual affection, do you intend to pursue the relationship?\n\nThat is not my decision to make actually, because she is also an independent woman, who is entitled to make her own decision. If she comes out and wants to be in a relationship with me, it is going to be a happy thing for me. But if it is otherwise, then I will still be there for her and I\u2019m sure she will be there for me.\n\nI\u2019m open to a relationship with her, she is an amazing person. Any man would be open to having a relationship with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you think the show is a reflection of society or does it influence society?\n\nThis is a question that answers itself because, at the end of the day, Big Brother Naija is a social experiment. The people you see there are real life characters, not one person is the same as the other.\n\nYou have a different set of personalities and they put them in a confined space for a period of days just to show you what real life is about. You don\u2019t expect everyone to be the same, you can have an edition where it is all about love, you can have another which is about intelligent people.\n\nAnd I believe that in this edition, a lot of us are intellectuals and are competitive. It had a different vibe this season and I loved it and enjoyed it. The show reflects our society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "A backstory to the tussle between CBN and forex rates platform abokiFX",
          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "Africell exits Ugandan telecom market due to fierce competition",
          "text": "On September 7, Africell announced its decision to leave Uganda after operating in the East African country for seven years. The decision saw the U.S-owned company become the latest network operator to throw in the towel and exit a market dominated by two pan-African telecom behemoths.\n\nA statement issued by Africell blames tough competition from the local units of MTN and Bharti Airtel, both of which account for more than 90% of the market share. The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com.

          "text": "More than six high-profile electronic bank fraud cases took place in Nigeria between February and July this year. Among these was the failed attempt on an account of a Federal Government parastatal domiciled with one of the first-generation banks in which well over N1 billion was transferred to various accounts across different banks in the country.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d some repentant bank hackers, told BusinessDay, \u201cbecause the transfers were done over the NEFT platform and it takes 24 hours to clear on that platform.

PwC in a recent report on Payments in Emerging Markets notes that to meet the need for financial inclusion, there has been a rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations, which are helping to make it more economically viable for banks to reach the \u2018unbanked\u2019 or \u2018underbanked\u2019 populations. Technology has leapfrogged from branch banking to e-banking and now mobile money, which has helped to create pockets of strength even among the less financially inclusive countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, usage of mobile-based payment systems has increased due to wide access to mobile phones as a payment form, both on the customer usage side and acceptance (merchant) side.\n\nA 2020 McKinsey & Co report observed that \u201ca youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.\u201d\n\nBut these variables have not just been drivers of financial inclusion alone.

The list of bank frauds perpetrated online is endless.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nelectronic bank fraud\n\nIn September 2020, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation arrested four Nigerian nationals in Muntinlupa City of the country for alleged involvement in an international syndicate that hacks and siphons funds from banks.\n\nAccording to the NBI, the fraudsters\u2019 transactions were traced when they hacked a system of one Philippine bank, where at least P100 million ($2m) were transferred into a different account.\n\nIn early 2016, a criminal gang penetrated the security systems of Bangladesh Bank with malware that cloned legitimate transactions. On February 4, the malware sent 35 withdrawal requests through the international SWIFT system to the New York Federal Reserve, where the Bangladeshi central bank had money on deposit. The fraudsters attempted to steal a total of $951 million. Thirty of the orders, worth $850 million, were blocked by the New York Fed, but the gang succeeded in having $101 million transferred to banks in Sri Lanka and the Philippines before their activities were noticed, thanks to a spelling mistake in one of the transfer requests. Subsequently, $20 million was recovered from a Sri Lankan bank, but officials were too late to stop the remaining $81 million from disappearing.\n\nIn January this year, the Police in Edo State arrested six suspected bank hackers who stole N5 million from a victim\u2019s account. One of the suspects, Adesola Kayode, was said to have confessed to the police: \u201cWe buy stolen SIM cards from armed robbers and thieves. We normally assess the ones that have money in their bank accounts and remove the money.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, the police in Kano State arrested eight men and two women for belonging to a syndicate that specialises in hacking individuals\u2019 bank accounts to withdraw money.\n\nAlmost a year earlier, a Lagos High Court convicted Abbas Mohammed and a Bureau De Change operator, Ibrahim Saidu Jogal, who connived to hack into the flexible database of Union Bank of N2,550,000,000 (two billion, five hundred and fifty million naira).\n\nIn February, Obiwanne Okeke, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, was jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11 million. Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US. His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.\n\nIn one phishing attack in 2018 he managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar\u2019s heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11 million, and moved the funds overseas.\n\nElectronic or e-banking in Nigeria has become so expansive that it is hard to believe that it was only in the 2000s that this reality began to gain prominence within the country\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHow frauds are committed, those behind them and their methodologies\n\nTargeting the business account of a large corporate or public sector organisation requires fraudsters to always recruit an insider from within the target organisation. In the case of the Federal Government parastatal targeted in April this year, such an insider was able to aid the hacking of the accounting platform of the parastatal by accessing the log-in details of as many as six approving officials.\n\nA device known as a \u2018Grabber\u2019 will be connected to the key-board of an approving officer\u2019s computer. The work of the grabber is to collect and send all actions on the keyboard to the fraudsters wherever they may be\u201d. The major objective of the fraudsters at this point is to get the password of the approving officers.\n\nWith the fraudsters\u2019 computer system connected to the parastatal\u2019s server, they now had a system that served as the link between the server and themselves. At this point, they could now comfortably operate from within or outside the country.\n\nThis is made possible by installing a software like TeamViewer which makes it further possible to connect multiple computers to one server once the master hard disc (computer connected to host server) is connected to the server of the targeted bank. TeamViewer is a remote access and remote control computer software that connects computers, smartphones, servers, IoT devices including robots, with fast, high performance connections through a global access network. It was first released in 2005, and its functionality has expanded step by step. It is proprietary software, but does not require registration and is free of charge for non-commercial use. It has been installed on more than two billion devices.\n\nI ask if they are aware of the recent hacking of a first-generation bank in early August. They all mention the name of the bank in unison. \u201cWord spreads around,\u201d they tell me. \u201cIt is impossible to undertake such a big project without word spreading in the community. People have to be recruited, accounts have to be opened and money has to be evacuated. You can\u2019t do that alone,\u201d one of them says.\n\nAccording to the Police Special Fraud Unit, after hacking the Flex-Cube Universal Banking System (FCUBS) of the bank, Salau Abdulmalik Femi created fictitious credits totalling One Billion, Eight Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,868,900,000.00) on the accounts of three of the bank\u2019s customers and successfully consummated debits (outflows) amounting to Four Hundred and Seventeen Million, Five Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand Naira (N417,542,000.00) through Internet Banking transfers to other banks.\n\nOver N1.8 billion was transferred out of different accounts domiciled with the bank using the most secure anti-fraud device known as TOKEN, as the gateway. What they did was to reconfigure existing TOKENS of other customers of the bank and refresh it to match a targeted account in the bank that has good money. Account providers then provided accounts which were credited with amounts ranging from twenty million naira (N20m) to five hundred million naira (N500m) depending on the volume the accounts can carry without raising a red flag.\n\nHow are these huge amounts evacuated and laundered through the system?\n\nThis is where the Bureaux De Change comes in. BDCs are the major platforms for laundering fraud-based monies. There is a long incestuous relationship between the BDCs and bank fraudsters, a relationship an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission tells me is well known to the regulators, the police and the anti-graft agencies.\n\nIn late July, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, banned the sale of foreign exchange to BDC operators. The ban, Emefiele said, was necessary because the parallel market had become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBDCs are indispensable partners with the fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. The BDCs do not originate any fraud operation, but they serve as the most credible and most practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the billions of naira hacked out of the banks\u201d.\n\nThe methodology is simple. The BDCs provide accounts to which the fraudsters who have attacked a bank pay let\u2019s say five hundred million naira into. The BDCs will then use the money to purchase dollars from the CBN from which they would pay the fraudsters an agreed percentage of the total amount credited to their accounts. Percentages range from 40 to 50 percent for the fraudster. So, if the BDC buys one million dollars from the CBN with the N500 million given to them by a fraudster, they will give the fraudster between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars and keep between five hundred and six hundred thousand dollars for themselves as their cut.\n\nWhy do the BDCs get such huge amounts when they are not involved in the initiation and operationalisation of the frauds? It is because the BDCs take the biggest risk. \u201cThey have to be paid well\u201d, I am told, \u201cbecause the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, the monies would easily be traced to them. With big risk comes big money\u201d.\n\nBut why do BDCs take such big risks? \u201cGreed!\u201d Ereke asserts. \u201cGreed and because they can get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe asks me if I have ever heard of a BDC owner jailed for abetting bank fraud.\n\nI cannot recollect any. He tells me that no BDC owner has ever been jailed for aiding fraudsters after the fact. \u201cSome owners and managers are arrested of course; they settle with the Police or EFCC and are released. Any BDC person jailed is just a low-level employee that has been put forward for just that purpose\u201d.\n\nWho is the Insider?\n\nWhat is the role of Insiders in e-banking frauds? Absolutely no bank fraud of any nature can happen without the collaboration of someone from the inside; a staff of the bank or staff of the organisation whose business account is being targeted. Though the insider in almost all cases is not the originator of the bank fraud, he or they (most times the fraudster will have multiple insiders on a single fraud transaction) playing a significant role in the operation.\n\nThe insider, they tell me, is responsible for plugging the keylogger to the system (for the hardware) or installing it on the system in the case of the software type. A keylogger is a small hardware device not bigger than the smallest flash drive. It is used to record keyboard actions, like keystrokes on a key-board, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. Some keyloggers also come as soft wares.\n\nDeveloped in the then Soviet Union in the 1970s, the Keylogger was first used by KGB (Soviet Intelligence Service) counterintelligence officers who installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow. They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters. It measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters. By doing this, they were able to determine the exact information American diplomats were sending back to their headquarters at the State Department in Washington.\n\nIt is almost impossible for fraudsters to hack into a bank\u2019s system from the outside, because all the banks operate on an intranet system. So, there is always the need for an insider who can smuggle a computer system into the bank and connect it to the server. Such a system must have been configured to provide intranet connectivity of the bank to the fraudsters anywhere they are in the world.\n\nIn addition, an insider is critical to the fraudsters in their understanding of the detailed process required to carry out fraudulent operations on a customer\u2019s bank account. This will include but not limited to initiation and authorisation process, withdrawal limits on specific accounts, confirmation system and approval patterns, among others.\n\nFurthermore, they enable the fraudsters to be very much cognisant of everything happening within the bank after the fraud has taken place. The post-fraud information they provide makes it difficult for the bank to arrest an account holder in the process of trying to make withdrawals because once the banks find out about the fraud, all account holders will be informed by the insider to stay clear for the meantime.\n\nThere is no specific profile of an insider based on tribe, region or religion, but a very distinctive characteristic of such an individual is someone who has gained the trust of his co-workers. They will be careless around him because of his hard work, cheerfulness and willingness to help.\n\nThe typical Insider is almost always a Male. Very few women tend to be willing to take big risks to serve as Insiders.\n\nIn searching for an insider, fraudsters tend to look out for bankers that are sociable and who tend to live above their income. A banker with a drug addiction is a very sure bet for recruitment as an insider. The insiders are cultivated by the fraudsters who expose them to a very lavish lifestyle. \u201cThey fly them on first class air tickets, lodge them in five-star hotels, ply them with some of the most expensive whiskey and wines, and in fact there are cases where senior insiders are flown on weekends to Dubai for operational meetings,\u201d they tell me.\n\nAn insider can be any staff of a bank, depending on the role he or she is expected to play. An insider can be a senior bank staff, junior staff, a bank cleaner or the security seated at the door.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you won\u2019t need a Head of Operations in a bank for the purpose of plugging a keylogger\u201d, Ele informs me. These classes of insiders are mostly casual staff of the bank who most times are aggrieved with their employer for a number of reasons such as low salaries, lack of motivation, bogus target, job insecurity and the ego factors such as having the requisite qualifications as their colleagues who are core staff with better enumeration. Even a cleaner can be recruited for key log plugging.\n\nAn insider that helps provide connectivity for remote access most likely would have a good knowledge of IT, this is so because IT information will be needed in setting up remote access; information such as URL, domain name and general information. Such a person is expected to be able to multitask. Among other things he or she is expected to identify accounts that will be attacked and debited for the fraud.\n\nAccount openers and account peddlers\n\nThese are people whose only role in the fraud cycle is the provision of accounts that will not be traceable to them in the event of fraud. What they do is recruit financially handicapped people in the society and open various bank accounts for them and then collect the ATM cards from them. Their targets are shoe shiners, truck pushers, bike riders (Okada) who have never had any dealings with a bank. The \u2018account peddler\u2019 tends to sell them a glossy but false story about the Federal Government distributing money to the poor through the banks. For these financially excluded persons to be able to access these monies, they are told they first need to open a bank account.\n\nBecause of voter awareness in the northern part of Nigeria most of this group of people have the INEC voter\u2019s card which is one of the means of identification needed to open a savings account. The \u2018peddler\u2019 now provides them with the other requirements needed, such as utility bills, phone number (which the peddler already has), email address and N10,000 (amount needed to open a bank account).\n\nWhen the account is opened and the bank ATM given to the account opener, the \u2018peddler\u2019 collects the ATM from the account owner on the pretext of taking it to the government agency for registration. A day or two later he calls the account holder, and informs him that the money has been paid into the account, gives him N10,000 and tells him that particular account cannot collect the grant twice. So now armed with his BVN from the first account, the \u2018peddler\u2019 will now take the account opener round commercial banks in town, opening accounts and paying N5000 to N10,000 for each account.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single person could provide between 10-12 ATM cards for the peddler. An active Peddler can recruit up to 10 persons in a month, and by doing so he will have control of over 100 accounts that are not traceable to him. In the event of a bank hacking fraud operation, he is able to provide these accounts to the fraudsters. If the fraudster credits each of these cards with N5 million each, the total will amount to over N500 million. He will then be given a percentage of the amount withdrawn from these accounts.\n\nThese funds tend to be withdrawn at different sources such as big departmental stores with the aid of staff such as the Manager or Supervisor of the store at an agreed percentage. He uses the ATM on their POS and collects cash. Petrol filling stations, electronics and car marts also serve as withdrawal points.\n\nOperational team\n\nThere is no specific number of persons required to undertake an electronic bank fraud. The \u2018Chairman\u2019 (initiator and supervisor of a particular fraud) alone determines exactly what he needs for the operation. So, he recruits people based on the input he requires and the operational strategy he has put in place. I am told there is a pool of bank fraudsters of over ten thousand people scattered across the country. So, all the \u2018chairman\u2019 needs, is to access the pool, where he will get all the \u2018specialists\u2019 needed. Each \u2018specialist\u2019 in the team for a specific bank fraud has a specific role to play. Nobody is called upon to participate unless there is a role he or she has to play. These include roles like an Insider to plug the keylogger, an Insider that can provide remote access, account peddlers that will be used for the evacuation of proceeds of the fraud and if need be, a sponsor of the operation.\n\nD-Day\n\nAlmost all bank frauds tend to take place during weekends and public holidays. The reason for this is to allow ample time for the monies hived out of the bank to be squirrelled away. \u201cIt is mostly on Fridays that these operations take place. Public holidays that begin on Thursdays are the most welcome period for bank fraud. This is because there will be sufficient time to carry out the operation, move the funds to twenty to fifty different accounts, and then the weekends and public holiday periods will allow them to withdraw the money through ATMs, POS, supermarket purchases and transfers to BDCs\u201d.\n\nA crime without end\n\nAndy Greenberg in Wired, aptly noted that \u201cthe traditional model of robbing a bank isn\u2019t so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one. Thieves get in, get the goods, and get out\u201d. In 2016, Nigeria\u2019s central bank warned, \u201cthat this digital journey is plagued with land mines represented by electronic fraud would be stating the obvious, as the world over has shifted security policy stances to a more cybercentric position. The warfare of banking security has changed from what was conventional to a constantly changing strategy in response to the rapid developments in payment technology\u2026\n\n\u201cThe story behind the figures clearly shows that as we move further down the digital path in payments, fraud attempts are bound to increase and the test of our strength as an Industry will be how effective the collaboration among all stakeholders in warding off this imminent threat to the payments system is, not only domestically but also internationally.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s world, bank thieves no longer need a sledgehammer and an AK-47 to break into your bank and steal your money. Their weapons of choice today are a harmless computer, an innocuous hardware and software; and with these harmless tools, they are able to steal a lot more money than they could ever have stolen with large instruments of violence. It is unlikely that electronic banking fraud will end anytime soon in Nigeria. While the regulators and the banks have continued to put up electronic ramparts and throw instruments and institutions of the criminal justice system to counteract the fraudsters, this at best is passive resistance.\n\nLack of a willingness by banks and the regulators to invest in understanding the risk landscape, archaic risk assessments, policies, procedures and controls would continue to result in knowledge gaps that serve as broad highways for fraudsters to walk into the Nigerian banking system.\n\nThe NIBBS was right when it posited that, \u201cthe anti-fraud battle can only be won when organisations institute a well-rounded strategy involving sensitisation, investments in well-suited technologies, risk management, effective governance, and industry-wide collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\u201d",

His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.\n\nIn one phishing attack in 2018 he managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar\u2019s heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11 million, and moved the funds overseas.\n\nElectronic or e-banking in Nigeria has become so expansive that it is hard to believe that it was only in the 2000s that this reality began to gain prominence within the country\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHow frauds are committed, those behind them and their methodologies\n\nTargeting the business account of a large corporate or public sector organisation requires fraudsters to always recruit an insider from within the target organisation. In the case of the Federal Government parastatal targeted in April this year, such an insider was able to aid the hacking of the accounting platform of the parastatal by accessing the log-in details of as many as six approving officials.\n\nA device known as a \u2018Grabber\u2019 will be connected to the key-board of an approving officer\u2019s computer. The work of the grabber is to collect and send all actions on the keyboard to the fraudsters wherever they may be\u201d. The major objective of the fraudsters at this point is to get the password of the approving officers.\n\nWith the fraudsters\u2019 computer system connected to the parastatal\u2019s server, they now had a system that served as the link between the server and themselves. At this point, they could now comfortably operate from within or outside the country.\n\nThis is made possible by installing a software like TeamViewer which makes it further possible to connect multiple computers to one server once the master hard disc (computer connected to host server) is connected to the server of the targeted bank. TeamViewer is a remote access and remote control computer software that connects computers, smartphones, servers, IoT devices including robots, with fast, high performance connections through a global access network. It was first released in 2005, and its functionality has expanded step by step. It is proprietary software, but does not require registration and is free of charge for non-commercial use. It has been installed on more than two billion devices.\n\nI ask if they are aware of the recent hacking of a first-generation bank in early August. They all mention the name of the bank in unison. \u201cWord spreads around,\u201d they tell me. \u201cIt is impossible to undertake such a big project without word spreading in the community. People have to be recruited, accounts have to be opened and money has to be evacuated. You can\u2019t do that alone,\u201d one of them says.\n\nAccording to the Police Special Fraud Unit, after hacking the Flex-Cube Universal Banking System (FCUBS) of the bank, Salau Abdulmalik Femi created fictitious credits totalling One Billion, Eight Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,868,900,000.00) on the accounts of three of the bank\u2019s customers and successfully consummated debits (outflows) amounting to Four Hundred and Seventeen Million, Five Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand Naira (N417,542,000.00) through Internet Banking transfers to other banks.\n\nOver N1.8 billion was transferred out of different accounts domiciled with the bank using the most secure anti-fraud device known as TOKEN, as the gateway. What they did was to reconfigure existing TOKENS of other customers of the bank and refresh it to match a targeted account in the bank that has good money. Account providers then provided accounts which were credited with amounts ranging from twenty million naira (N20m) to five hundred million naira (N500m) depending on the volume the accounts can carry without raising a red flag.\n\nHow are these huge amounts evacuated and laundered through the system?\n\nThis is where the Bureaux De Change comes in. BDCs are the major platforms for laundering fraud-based monies. There is a long incestuous relationship between the BDCs and bank fraudsters, a relationship an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission tells me is well known to the regulators, the police and the anti-graft agencies.\n\nIn late July, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, banned the sale of foreign exchange to BDC operators. The ban, Emefiele said, was necessary because the parallel market had become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBDCs are indispensable partners with the fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. The BDCs do not originate any fraud operation, but they serve as the most credible and most practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the billions of naira hacked out of the banks\u201d.\n\nThe methodology is simple. The BDCs provide accounts to which the fraudsters who have attacked a bank pay let\u2019s say five hundred million naira into. The BDCs will then use the money to purchase dollars from the CBN from which they would pay the fraudsters an agreed percentage of the total amount credited to their accounts. Percentages range from 40 to 50 percent for the fraudster. So, if the BDC buys one million dollars from the CBN with the N500 million given to them by a fraudster, they will give the fraudster between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars and keep between five hundred and six hundred thousand dollars for themselves as their cut.\n\nWhy do the BDCs get such huge amounts when they are not involved in the initiation and operationalisation of the frauds? It is because the BDCs take the biggest risk. \u201cThey have to be paid well\u201d, I am told, \u201cbecause the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, the monies would easily be traced to them. With big risk comes big money\u201d.\n\nBut why do BDCs take such big risks? \u201cGreed!\u201d Ereke asserts. \u201cGreed and because they can get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe asks me if I have ever heard of a BDC owner jailed for abetting bank fraud.\n\nI cannot recollect any. He tells me that no BDC owner has ever been jailed for aiding fraudsters after the fact. \u201cSome owners and managers are arrested of course; they settle with the Police or EFCC and are released. Any BDC person jailed is just a low-level employee that has been put forward for just that purpose\u201d.\n\nWho is the Insider?\n\nWhat is the role of Insiders in e-banking frauds? Absolutely no bank fraud of any nature can happen without the collaboration of someone from the inside; a staff of the bank or staff of the organisation whose business account is being targeted. Though the insider in almost all cases is not the originator of the bank fraud, he or they (most times the fraudster will have multiple insiders on a single fraud transaction) playing a significant role in the operation.\n\nThe insider, they tell me, is responsible for plugging the keylogger to the system (for the hardware) or installing it on the system in the case of the software type. A keylogger is a small hardware device not bigger than the smallest flash drive. It is used to record keyboard actions, like keystrokes on a key-board, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. Some keyloggers also come as soft wares.\n\nDeveloped in the then Soviet Union in the 1970s, the Keylogger was first used by KGB (Soviet Intelligence Service) counterintelligence officers who installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow. They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters. It measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters. By doing this, they were able to determine the exact information American diplomats were sending back to their headquarters at the State Department in Washington.\n\nIt is almost impossible for fraudsters to hack into a bank\u2019s system from the outside, because all the banks operate on an intranet system. So, there is always the need for an insider who can smuggle a computer system into the bank and connect it to the server. Such a system must have been configured to provide intranet connectivity of the bank to the fraudsters anywhere they are in the world.\n\nIn addition, an insider is critical to the fraudsters in their understanding of the detailed process required to carry out fraudulent operations on a customer\u2019s bank account. This will include but not limited to initiation and authorisation process, withdrawal limits on specific accounts, confirmation system and approval patterns, among others.\n\nFurthermore, they enable the fraudsters to be very much cognisant of everything happening within the bank after the fraud has taken place. The post-fraud information they provide makes it difficult for the bank to arrest an account holder in the process of trying to make withdrawals because once the banks find out about the fraud, all account holders will be informed by the insider to stay clear for the meantime.\n\nThere is no specific profile of an insider based on tribe, region or religion, but a very distinctive characteristic of such an individual is someone who has gained the trust of his co-workers. They will be careless around him because of his hard work, cheerfulness and willingness to help.\n\nThe typical Insider is almost always a Male. Very few women tend to be willing to take big risks to serve as Insiders.\n\nIn searching for an insider, fraudsters tend to look out for bankers that are sociable and who tend to live above their income. A banker with a drug addiction is a very sure bet for recruitment as an insider. The insiders are cultivated by the fraudsters who expose them to a very lavish lifestyle. \u201cThey fly them on first class air tickets, lodge them in five-star hotels, ply them with some of the most expensive whiskey and wines, and in fact there are cases where senior insiders are flown on weekends to Dubai for operational meetings,\u201d they tell me.\n\nAn insider can be any staff of a bank, depending on the role he or she is expected to play. An insider can be a senior bank staff, junior staff, a bank cleaner or the security seated at the door.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you won\u2019t need a Head of Operations in a bank for the purpose of plugging a keylogger\u201d, Ele informs me. These classes of insiders are mostly casual staff of the bank who most times are aggrieved with their employer for a number of reasons such as low salaries, lack of motivation, bogus target, job insecurity and the ego factors such as having the requisite qualifications as their colleagues who are core staff with better enumeration. Even a cleaner can be recruited for key log plugging.\n\nAn insider that helps provide connectivity for remote access most likely would have a good knowledge of IT, this is so because IT information will be needed in setting up remote access; information such as URL, domain name and general information. Such a person is expected to be able to multitask. Among other things he or she is expected to identify accounts that will be attacked and debited for the fraud.\n\nAccount openers and account peddlers\n\nThese are people whose only role in the fraud cycle is the provision of accounts that will not be traceable to them in the event of fraud. What they do is recruit financially handicapped people in the society and open various bank accounts for them and then collect the ATM cards from them. Their targets are shoe shiners, truck pushers, bike riders (Okada) who have never had any dealings with a bank. The \u2018account peddler\u2019 tends to sell them a glossy but false story about the Federal Government distributing money to the poor through the banks. For these financially excluded persons to be able to access these monies, they are told they first need to open a bank account.\n\nBecause of voter awareness in the northern part of Nigeria most of this group of people have the INEC voter\u2019s card which is one of the means of identification needed to open a savings account. The \u2018peddler\u2019 now provides them with the other requirements needed, such as utility bills, phone number (which the peddler already has), email address and N10,000 (amount needed to open a bank account).\n\nWhen the account is opened and the bank ATM given to the account opener, the \u2018peddler\u2019 collects the ATM from the account owner on the pretext of taking it to the government agency for registration. A day or two later he calls the account holder, and informs him that the money has been paid into the account, gives him N10,000 and tells him that particular account cannot collect the grant twice. So now armed with his BVN from the first account, the \u2018peddler\u2019 will now take the account opener round commercial banks in town, opening accounts and paying N5000 to N10,000 for each account.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single person could provide between 10-12 ATM cards for the peddler. An active Peddler can recruit up to 10 persons in a month, and by doing so he will have control of over 100 accounts that are not traceable to him. In the event of a bank hacking fraud operation, he is able to provide these accounts to the fraudsters. If the fraudster credits each of these cards with N5 million each, the total will amount to over N500 million. He will then be given a percentage of the amount withdrawn from these accounts.\n\nThese funds tend to be withdrawn at different sources such as big departmental stores with the aid of staff such as the Manager or Supervisor of the store at an agreed percentage. He uses the ATM on their POS and collects cash. Petrol filling stations, electronics and car marts also serve as withdrawal points.\n\nOperational team\n\nThere is no specific number of persons required to undertake an electronic bank fraud. The \u2018Chairman\u2019 (initiator and supervisor of a particular fraud) alone determines exactly what he needs for the operation. So, he recruits people based on the input he requires and the operational strategy he has put in place. I am told there is a pool of bank fraudsters of over ten thousand people scattered across the country. So, all the \u2018chairman\u2019 needs, is to access the pool, where he will get all the \u2018specialists\u2019 needed. Each \u2018specialist\u2019 in the team for a specific bank fraud has a specific role to play. Nobody is called upon to participate unless there is a role he or she has to play. These include roles like an Insider to plug the keylogger, an Insider that can provide remote access, account peddlers that will be used for the evacuation of proceeds of the fraud and if need be, a sponsor of the operation.\n\nD-Day\n\nAlmost all bank frauds tend to take place during weekends and public holidays. The reason for this is to allow ample time for the monies hived out of the bank to be squirrelled away. \u201cIt is mostly on Fridays that these operations take place. Public holidays that begin on Thursdays are the most welcome period for bank fraud. This is because there will be sufficient time to carry out the operation, move the funds to twenty to fifty different accounts, and then the weekends and public holiday periods will allow them to withdraw the money through ATMs, POS, supermarket purchases and transfers to BDCs\u201d.\n\nA crime without end\n\nAndy Greenberg in Wired, aptly noted that \u201cthe traditional model of robbing a bank isn\u2019t so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one. Thieves get in, get the goods, and get out\u201d. In 2016, Nigeria\u2019s central bank warned, \u201cthat this digital journey is plagued with land mines represented by electronic fraud would be stating the obvious, as the world over has shifted security policy stances to a more cybercentric position. The warfare of banking security has changed from what was conventional to a constantly changing strategy in response to the rapid developments in payment technology\u2026\n\n\u201cThe story behind the figures clearly shows that as we move further down the digital path in payments, fraud attempts are bound to increase and the test of our strength as an Industry will be how effective the collaboration among all stakeholders in warding off this imminent threat to the payments system is, not only domestically but also internationally.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s world, bank thieves no longer need a sledgehammer and an AK-47 to break into your bank and steal your money. Their weapons of choice today are a harmless computer, an innocuous hardware and software; and with these harmless tools, they are able to steal a lot more money than they could ever have stolen with large instruments of violence. It is unlikely that electronic banking fraud will end anytime soon in Nigeria. While the regulators and the banks have continued to put up electronic ramparts and throw instruments and institutions of the criminal justice system to counteract the fraudsters, this at best is passive resistance.\n\nLack of a willingness by banks and the regulators to invest in understanding the risk landscape, archaic risk assessments, policies, procedures and controls would continue to result in knowledge gaps that serve as broad highways for fraudsters to walk into the Nigerian banking system.\n\nThe NIBBS was right when it posited that, \u201cthe anti-fraud battle can only be won when organisations institute a well-rounded strategy involving sensitisation, investments in well-suited technologies, risk management, effective governance, and industry-wide collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\u201d",

          "text": "Bunmi lives in Maitama, a swanky district of Nigeria\u2019s capital city, Abuja. She runs a medium-sized fashion design and fabric procurement outfit from her home from where she dresses a small but well-heeled posse of customers, and supplies draperies and textiles to clients.\n\nShe sighs as she remembers the day, she said changed her life. \u201cIt was on Saturday, July 11th last year,\u201d she said.\n\nWith a corporate account in one of the fastest growing banks in the country, she had become worried after customers, including an international NGO based in the city had paid ninety-three million naira into her corporate account over a two-day period for the supply of fabrics. \u201cI became nervous,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I neither received alerts nor emails on my phone alerting me to these deposits. It was very unusual. I actually thought it was a network problem. In fact, I hadn\u2019t been bothered initially; it was after a few hours that I began to get agitated. I needed to pay my suppliers in Lagos that Saturday\u201d.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nBunmi called her friend who works in the bank that evening, and it was then she found out that her alerting system had been compromised. Fraudsters had taken over the phone and email alert instructions she left with her bank and routed the alerts to themselves.\n\nThey had also changed her daily transfer limits of ten million naira.\n\n\u201cThey stole ninety-nine million naira from my account!\u201d she said agonizingly.\n\nBunmi\u2019s account wasn\u2019t the only one hacked that day by fraudsters. Four accounts, including a public sector account were attacked a day before, and four hundred and eleven million was stolen from the bank.\n\nShe said the experience has left her paranoid and suspicious. \u201cI am always going online to check my accounts\u2019 status every now and then. I just have these paranoid thoughts that it\u2019s going to happen again. If the bank hadn\u2019t refunded my money, I would have been ruined. It took me years to build my business\u201d.\n\nHer bank replaced her money after they pleaded with her not to publicise her experience.\n\nArchie (not real name), an accountant, also lives in Abuja. He used to work with a parastatal under the Federal Capital Territory involved in the provision of water to the city\u2019s residents. He remembers the day they discovered that over three hundred million naira had been stolen from their account.\n\n\u201cIt was in 2016, if I recollect well. We later found out that the hackers had compromised our passwords, changed our debit and transfer instructions with our bankers and simply stole our money.\n\n\u201cUntil then, we had always thought we had a fairly safe system of managing our finances with the banks. I cannot remember if we had a phone alert system in place but we certainly received emails from our bankers whenever there were transactions on our accounts\u201d.\n\nLarge public sector organisations as well as big corporate concerns are common targets of certain gangs of bank hackers who want to maximise the economies of scale. The principle is to target big institutions and steal large amounts of money.",

          "text": "The government of Anambra State has expressed sadness over the passing of elder statesman, Alhaji Abdulazeez Chivuzor Ude.\n\nA statement by the state\u2019s commissioner for information and public enlightenment, C Don Adinuba, said the state government received the news of Ude\u2019s passing with sadness, describing it a huge loss to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people and Government of Anambra State have received with sadness the news of the death two days ago of Chief Abdulaziz Chivuzor Ude, the internationally renowned publisher, intellectual, art lover, pan Africanist, entrepreneur and philanthropist from Abor, Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State who played a significant part in modern Igbo history. He died in Lagos in his late 80s, and was buried in his hometown in the afternoon yesterday in line with the Islamic injunction,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\n\u201cHe was Christened Bertrand at an early age and became the first senior prefect of the College of Immaculate Conception (CIC), Enugu, Ude attended Oxford University where he read philosophy, economics and politics before proceeding to Columbia University in New York where he took a master\u2019s degree in international relations.\n\n\u201cHe caught public attention when, while working as an editor at Random House in New York, the world\u2019s biggest book publishing firm, he published Chinua Achebe\u2019s classic, Things Fall Apart, in the United States during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-70. He was to strike a lifelong relationship with Achebe, and made handsome contributions to Achebe\u2019s Okike: A Journal of New African Writing, established in 1971 at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\n\n\u201cUde also struck a lifelong relationship in the late 1960s with such Anambra indigenes as Dr Chuba Okadigbo, then an academic in Washington, DC. He worked closely with Dr Okadigbo when the latter was appointed the Special Political Adviser to President Shehu Shagari from 1979 to 1983. When Okadigbo founded Platform, an analytical news magazine, based in Lagos, Chief Ude stood with him all the way, making critical financial interventions.\n\n\u201cThere were many persons of Anambra State origin in top management of his enterprises like Gordon and Georgi Umunna who worked on Financial Post. His friendship with the hugely popular musician, Chief Oliver Akanite from Nnewi South Local Government Area popularly known as Oliver de Coque, was such that the entertainer waxed an album dedicated to Chief Ude which turned out to be a national bestseller.\n\n\u201cUnknown to most people because of his self-effacing nature, Chief Ude contributed significantly to the creation of Anambra, Enugu, Delta and Ebonyi states. Apart from being one of the signatories to the petition for the creation of these states to the Ibrahim Babangida military regime, he donated not just cash but also his private jet to transport the Igbo patriots like Dr Alex Ekwueme, Chike Edozie, Dr Akanu Ibiam, Chief CC Onoh and Dr Okadigbo to different cities who signed the petition.\n\n\u201cHe also donated part of his building at 59 Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, to coordinate the campaign for the creation of Igbo states and paid the staff. The then traditional ruler of Enugwu Ukwu, Igwe Osita Agwuna, one of Nigeria\u2019s foremost nationalists, was to confer a high title on him for services to the Igbo world.\n\n\u201cUde\u2019s Nok book publishing firm in Enugu, New York, London and Lagos, published such outstanding works as Chinweizu\u2019s The West and the Rest of Us and Romanus Egudu\u2019s Study of Four West Africans. Ude, in addition, financed Eddie Iroh\u2019s Chic, the London-based colourful social magazine. He was, indeed, a pan Africanist of the finest hue.\n\n\u201cAn active member of The African Business Round Table for several years, Ude awarded scholarships to hundreds of people to study in top universities in the world and assisted many others in different fields quietly. For example, he was a major promoter of the exhibitions of Aka: The Circle of Exhibiting Artists like Professor Obiora Udechukwu, Professor Chike Aniakor, Tayo Adenaike, Dr Obiora Anidi, Nsikak Essien, Chris Afuba, Bona Ezeudu and Boniface Okafor.\n\n\u201cEver humble, he practised egalitarianism in truth and spirit. He never discriminated against the less privileged or those who did not share his religious views.

          "title": "The Osun Federal Government Road Construction Refunds: The True State Of Affairs, By Bola Oyebamiji",
          "text": "My attention has been drawn to a viral video being circulated on the social media by the former Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr. Sikiru Ayedun, who by his unsubstantiated claims, could mislead the public through misrepresentation of facts on the state of refund by the Federal Government to the Osun State Government on all the federal roads constructed by the previous administration and the Osun debt portfolio management by the present administration.\n\nIn setting the records straight, it is important to emphatically and explicitly state that such claims, as presented in the video under reference, is capable of creating disharmony, strife and bad blood within the progressive family.\n\nThe claim that the sum of N48billion has been received by the Oyetola led administration as refund on federal roads constructed within the state is untrue.\n\nThe total contract sum of all federal road projects embarked upon by the Osun State Government, as approved by the Federal Ministry of Works, is N38billion. It is therefore against logic that the sum of N48bn will be paid by the FG for projects whose total contract sum equals N38bn. The projects in question, as at November, 2018, on the average, was less than 35% completion.\n\nAvailable records show that the Osun State Government awarded the 29km Gbongan \u2013 Akoda dualization project in 2013 for N29bn while the 40km Osogbo \u2013 Ikirun \u2013 Ila Odo Kwara boundary was awarded for N17.5bn in the same year, making both projects to amount to N46.5bn as proposed by Osun State Government. However, after due diligence and thorough assessment by the FG Public Procurement Agency, the contract sum was reviewed downward thus: Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road at N23bn, and Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road at N15bn respectively to carry the approved award contract sum of N38bn for all the ongoing FG roads under construction. This review was duly communicated to the Osun State Government.\n\nAs at November 2018, the contractor handling Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project had received a total sum of N10.2bn, out of which 3.5km of the 29km stretched road have been completed including the Gbongan Interchange and the project was at 29% completion while the contractor handling the Osogbo \u2013 Ila Odo road collected a total sum of N9.2bn, with 49% completion rate; the implication is that the Osun State Government had paid both contractors the sum of N19.4bn as at November 2018. Similarly, the total refund by the FG to the state as today, in three tranches, stood at N11.9bn based on the project delivered by both contractors. It is imperative to state that the FG refund of N11.9bn has been judiciously utilized and ploughed back into four (4) inherited road projects embarked upon by the previous administration contrary to the unsubstantiated claims by Mr. Ayedun that the refund is being used to pay full salaries to civil servants in the state.\n\nAs at today, Gbongan \u2013 Akoda road project is at 36% completion stage, with 8.6km asphalted on both sides of the road. Also, the Osogbo \u2013 Ila odo project which was at 49% in November 2018 is now at 55% completion, Oba Adesoji Aderemi road which was equally inherited at 65% completion is at 74% now and Ilesa \u2013 Iperindo \u2013 Ipetu Ijesa road project rose from 40% to 66% completion stage. It is also instructive to note that since the advent of Oyetola administration, additional 60km of road had been reconstructed and fully completed, with another 10 township roads presently under construction; these are expected to be completed before the end of 2021 including the Iconic Olaiya flyover.\n\nWhile we refrain from joining issues with anyone, the State Government of Osun under the leadership of Gov. Gboyega Oyetola has expended over N150bn on prompt payment of full salaries and pensions. It is a fact that Osun State remains one of the few states paying minimum wage of N30,000 in spite of our precarious and highly geared financial situation. This is in fulfillment of the pact he made with Osun citizens when he assumed office in 2018. Whereas, it is true that both the state\u2019s N30bn and N11.4bn Sukuk bonds have been fully repaid, the current government has paid over N67bn as loan repayment during its 33months of administration in the State without borrowing a kobo till date.\n\nThe ingenuity and doggedness of Governor Gboyega Oyetola, has ensured a significant reduction in the total debt portfolio of Osun State.\n\nHowever, inspite of this unprecedented boldness in public financial management, Osun remains the third (3rd) most indebted state among the 36 states of Nigeria. This can be verified from the website of the Debt Management Office.\n\nWithout sounding like a broken record, let me reaffirm that Governor Gboyega Oyetola will continue to deploy his over 3 decades of managerial experience as a risk manager, a welfarist and financial guru to move the economy of the state towards prosperity of the larger percentage of Osun citizens.\n\nFinally, I urge all well meaning Osun citizens both politician and otherwise, to endeavour to verify all information before publication and dissemination. This will ensure a peaceful and healthy political atmosphere for all and sundry.\n\nThe State Government of Osun under Governor Gboyega Oyetola hereby reiterates her commitment to provide a secured, financially viable and paeceful environment so Osun may continue to thrive.\n\nI want to implore us as all political leaders and Omoluabis (virtuous people) to support Mr Governor in his quest for a greater Osun.\n\nBola Oyebamiji is the\n\nHonourable commissioner for Finance, Osun State",

The panel discovered that there was communication between Kyari and Hushpuppi, as well as infractions on the part of the cop, which is against the procedure of engagement of the police,\u201d a top security source informed Daily Trust on Sunday.\n\nHe, however, said the panel didn\u2019t recommend the extradition of Kyari as it couldn\u2019t be established that the decorated police officer committed any crime in the US.\n\n\u201cThere is no proof that he committed any crime on the soil of the US to warrant his extradition. He will be sanctioned by the appropriate authorities here. However, it is for the AGF to advise if there is a ground to extradite him to the US, which is very unlikely,\u201d he added.\n\nForce spokesman, Frank Mba, in a telephone interview, disclosed that in line with the procedure of the Police, the IGP has forwarded the recommendations of the panel to the PSC for appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe committee submitted its report and the IGP has forwarded their findings to the appropriate authorities, which have oversight function on the police, specifically the PSC, which I believe is currently reviewing it,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting, Dr Umar Gwandu, the media aide to the AGF and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said his boss would give his opinion on the matter as appropriate.\n\n\u201cIn line with the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and that of the extant laws, the AGF will do the needful,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a senior police officer said it was only the PSC that could sanction Kyari as stipulated by law. He said the sanction could be suspension, reduction in rank or dismissal.\n\nA security expert, Kabir Adamu, added that police officers could be tried in court in the case of a criminal offence.",

          "text": "As part of measures to ascertain a comprehensive data to work out effective measures to check the impact of climate change, the country needs to integrate climate change education into the school curriculum.\n\nSpeaking on this need, Former Director-General, Nigeria Metrological Agency, NiMet , Dr. Anthony Anuforom, who gave the advice to the press in Abuja said that the impact of climate change could be reduced by enlightening people about the causes and ensuring that individuals, as well as communities, were prepared to cope with the impact through adaptation to mitigation measures.\n\nAccording to Anuforom integration of Climate Change education into school curriculum as envisaged in the National Policy on Climate Change, would reduce the impact, especially in states that are vulnerable to flood disasters.\n\nHe therefore advised State governments to liaise with NiMet to disseminate whether forecast in local languages as part of the Climate Change education Programme.\n\nThe former Director General of NiMet said Lake Chad and other lakes in the country were drying up and at risk of disappearing while Temperature had risen significantly since the 1980s.\n\n\u201cClimate projections for the coming decades reveal a significant increase in temperature over all the ecological zones. A lot has been happening on climate change and it can be traceable back to the emission of Carbon dioxide and other gases in to the air, these are called Green House gases. To treat the issues of climate change you have to go back to the history. Economies have been developing with invention of machines. Carbon dioxide used to fuel these machines as well as these Green House gases does a lot to the atmosphere and causes climate change and causing temperature of the earth rising to some degree temperature before pre mechanized era. The excess energy trapped in the air causes the weather to change abnormally. Extreme weather effects such as cyclone, tsunami are caused by extreme climate change. And NiMet with is newly sophisticated hardware and equipment is doing it\u2019s best to give appropriate weather forecast. The Agency is picking up things to ensure accuracy in it\u2019s weather forecast and to keep pace with it\u2019s contemporaries. The country at the out break of Ebola has been able to assist other African countries with accurate weather forecast. The WHO requested for our highly recommended forecast and that was how our service of giving weather forecast to other countries to enable health workers cope with the climate of a particular region or country in order to deliver proper health care services. Also NiMet\u2019s project of Saving Life at Sea, is one of the ways the Agency can increase it\u2019s IGR so as to improve the country economic growth and development,\u201d Dr. Anuforom explained.\n\nHe stressed that there were few comprehensive reports and papers that provided useful evidence and discussion of the various impacts of climate change throughout Nigeria.\n\nAnuforom explained that the vast majority of the literature that provided evidence of climate change impacts and responses, however, focused on the agricultural sector and on individual farming communities in particular regions of the country.",

Lukman has warned leaders and members of his party to be circumspect in reposing their trust in Femi Fani-Kayode following his defection to the party.\n\nFani-Kayode, a one time Minister of Aviation under the administration of president Olusegun Obasanjo, last Thursday defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the ruling APC and was received with a red carpet treatment by president Muhammadu Buhari in company of Yobe State governor and Chairman APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, Mai Mala Buni as well as Zamfara State governor, Bello Matawalle at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe defection of Fani-Kayode, a notorious critic of APC and president Buhari, has since sparked off negative commentaries from analysts across the media space in the country, and outrage from disenchanted members who felt the party was yet to accord them the honour accorded the decampee despite their loyalty.\n\nHowever, in a statement titled, \u201cAPC\u2019s High-Profile Membership Recruitment and Issues for 2023\u201d, issued Sunday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, Dr. Lukman stated that though Mr Fani-Kayode joined the party as a reformed and repentant critic, he should not be blindly trusted.\n\n\u201cHis (Mr. Fani-Kayode\u2019s) statement to the effect that \u2018let\u2019s focus on unity, peace and togetherness\u2019 is an encouraging testament. For Mr. Fani-Kayode to talk of the unity of Nigeria at this time, shortly after he supported and promoted secessionist campaigns of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho is a remarkable departure.\n\n\u201cHowever, recognising such a departure shouldn\u2019t be interpreted to mean that we should blindly trust Mr. Fani-Kayode,\u201d he averred.\n\nThe party chieftain recalled that some politicians have in the like manner joined the party in past and got similar red-carpet reception only for them to turned against the party and betrayed the trust reposed in them.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo doubt, since 2015, there are many opportunistic political leaders in the country who joined our party, got all the welcome reception, like the one given to Mr. Fani-Kayode, but end up betraying and in some instances outrightly undermining our party and our leaders.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably therefore, part of the frustration of many APC members is that most times, it could be predicted that our leaders are wrongly investing trust and confidence on wrong people.\u201d\n\nThe rumour of Mr. Fani-Kayode joining the APC, first emerged on Monday, February 8, 2021, when his pictures together with that of Buni and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State appeared on many social media platforms.\n\nThis made many party members to protest the plan by party leaders to admit FFK as fondly called into the APC, a rumour which Mr. Fani-Kayode himself denied vowing never to join the party in his \u201cnatural life\u201d.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has reacted to the Federal Government\u2019s plan to source for fresh loans, saying borrowing to accumulate debt for the next generation is criminal.\n\nSpeaking to Channels Television on the sidelines of an event in South Africa, Obasanjo noted that if the existing debt is left unserviced or unpaid, it might become a problem for successive administrations.\n\nWhile noting that borrowing is not a problem, the former Nigerian leader stated that what could be a problem would be what one is borrowing for and the plan or capacity to pay back.\n\n\u201cBut if you are borrowing and accumulating debts for the next generation and the next generation after them, it is criminal. What are you borrowing for?\u201d Obasanjo asked.\n\n\u201cIf we are borrowing for recurrent expenditure, it is the height of folly. If we are borrowing for development that can pay for itself, that is understandable. Then the payment, how long will it take to pay itself?\u201d\n\nThe ex-president recalled that during his tenure in 1999, the country was spending $3.5 billion to service debts that kept on increasing.\n\n\u201cWhen I came into government as elected President, we were spending $3.5 billion to service debts. Even with that, our quantum of debts was not going down.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s debts have continued to rise as the Federal Government seeks foreign loans to deliver key infrastructural projects.\n\nFive days ago, President Muhammadu Buhari wrote to the National Assembly, seeking approval to borrow fresh sums of $4,054,476,863 and \u20ac710 million in an addendum to the 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nIn the letter, the President explained that owing to \u201cemerging needs\u201d, there is a need to raise more funds for some \u201ccritical projects\u201d, while seeking the parliament\u2019s nod to also approve grant components of $125 million.\n\nThe request was in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday.\n\nIn July, the national assembly approved the sums of $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.",

So, I enjoin all residents to sustain this effort.\u201d\n\nHe noted that LAWMA will not leave any stone unturned in a determined effort to rid Lagos State of all forms of solid waste.\n\nMr Odumboni added that \u201cOur Marine Unit is effectively evacuating marine debris around the Lagos waterways and we will continue to increase the scope of our activities.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the President of the Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria (AWAN), Mr David Oriyomi, noted that it was important to educate residents of the aquatic environment on the effects of dumping rubbish into the water.\n\nMr Oriyomi said that the fishes feed on that rubbish while human beings fed on the fishes which was very dangerous to human health.\n\nIn his remark, the Chairman of Lagos Recyclers Association, Mr Femi Idowu, noted that what people see as trash, was actually money, suggesting that people should see the economic value in waste materials.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
