          "title": "Kanu, Igboho: Afenifere, Ohanaeze back political solution, demand release",
          "text": "There are indications that the leaders of self-determination groups, Nnamdi Kanu of the Indigenous People of Biafra, and Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, of the Yoruba Nation, are ready for discussions with the Federal Government.\n\nCounsel for the Yoruba Nation and IPOB leaders, Yomi Aliyu, SAN, and Alloy Ejimakor, disclosed this in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Thursday.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, had during a press briefing on Wednesday said the Federal Government would not rule out political solutions to resolving separatist agitations in the country.\n\nMalami had also reiterated that though the Federal Government had not considered any political solution yet, it would not rule out any opportunity to broker peace with the self-determination agitators.\n\nAliyu told our correspondent that his client was ready to embrace dialogue as long as the Federal Government was ready to discuss with him.\n\nHe, however, stated that the negotiations would have to take place without interference from political and socio-cultural groups.\n\nAliyu said, \u201cEvery war ends at the roundtable. When youths are angry, you cannot use force to quench their anger. Some youths came to me and told me that they wanted to demonstrate and I told them to do it peacefully.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t allow people to speak out, they go underground and what happens underground is what leads to revolution.\n\n\u201cIgboho\u2019s wife, Ropo, called me and told me that this was what she heard. I told her to go and speak to her husband about it and she did. She is my niece and she called me back and said he told her that he was ready if they (Federal Government people) were ready. We are not negotiating through Afenifere or politicians or Ohanaeze or anybody. He is in the cell in Cotonou; let the Nigerian government come and negotiate with him.\n\n\u201cHe is ready for peace so long as they are ready; but if they refuse, he said he is ready to die for what he believes in.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the coordinating counsel for Igboho\u2019s legal team in Nigeria and Benin Republic, Olasupo Ojo, maintained that his client committed no crime and that self-determination was a fundamental human right.\n\nHe said the over four-month detention of his clients in Benin Republic was no longer a judicial, but a political matter.\n\nOjo said, \u201cIt is good that the Federal Government of Nigeria, through Malami, is finally admitting its involvement in the continuous incarceration of Sunday Igboho in the Republic of Benin\u2019s prison, because if they are not part of it, they won\u2019t be talking of political solutions.\n\n\u201cIt is up to the government to determine what it wants to do and it is also an admission that these people have not committed any offence and it is all politics that is being played.\u201d\n\nAnother member of Igboho\u2019s legal team, Pelumi Olajengbesi, said the government not ruling out a political solution to address the matter was a welcome development.\n\nOlajengbesi, however, said insecurity in the South-West and other challenges that forced Igboho to embrace secessionist agitation must be addressed.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a welcome development. Sunday Igboho is not against political solutions to the crisis that is on the ground, because his desire is for people to live peacefully and have safety and security in the country.\n\n\u201cIf we must resolve this matter politically, the Federal Government must come clean and it needs to apologise to Chief Sunday Igboho for the act of lawlessness demonstrated in his house on July 1, 2021, and the government must restore the property destroyed in his house and guarantee his security.\u201d\n\nEjimakor, on his part, told one of our correspondents that his client had always been open to dialogue even before his arrest.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYou will recall that in early September 2017, Nnamdi Kanu was in dialogue with the South-East governors with the tacit blessings of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe subject matter was a political solution to the agitation. Then, all of a sudden, the dialogue was terminated and Operation Python Dance was brought to bear. It was not Kanu, who terminated the dialogue. What ensued after nearly cost him his life.\n\n\u201cWhen someone demands self-determination through referendum, he has committed no crime known to any law, municipal or international.\n\n\u201cInstead, such a person has demonstrated sufficient respect and consideration for the state and the government that leads it.\u201d\n\nEjimakor, however, said the Federal Government had the responsibility to initiate the dialogue with the IPOB leader.\n\nHe said, \u201cJust like the AGF has not ruled out dialogue, Kanu himself has never said anything to indicate that he ever foreclosed the prospects of dialogue.\n\n\u201cSo, the question is, who initiates the dialogue? In my view, it is the Federal Government and not Kanu, which bears the responsibility to initiate the dialogue.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is unnatural to negotiate with a man in chains. Dialogue cannot be meaningful without some freewill on the part of the parties, including particularly Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\nHe added that releasing Kanu from incarceration and discontinuing his prosecution should be the starting point.\n\nAnother member of Kanu\u2019s legal team, Maxwell Opara, in a telephone interview with one of our correspondents on Thursday, said a political solution might address the situation.\n\nOpara, however, urged the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to withdraw the charges against Kanu and release him to Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the traditional rulers in the zone.\n\n\u201cAs far as the security situation is concerned and as far as governance and this administration is concerned, you cannot rule out all possibilities,\u201d Opara said.\n\nWhen asked whether a political solution will quell the IPOB agitation, the lawyer said, \u201cYes, it can; it is all about talking (dialogue). Don\u2019t we have issues in our various families? Don\u2019t we have issues at work and other places? But everybody comes to the roundtable to resolve it.\u201d\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze back political solution, seek Kanu, Igboho\u2019s release\n\nMeanwhile, socio-political groups, Afenifere and Ohanaeze Ndigbo, have backed the political solution being considered by the AGF to resolve the criminal charges brought against Igboho and Kanu.\n\nKanu, who has been in the custody of the Department of States Services, is facing terrorism charges, while Igboho has been in a Beninese detention facility since July 19, 2021 amid attempts by the Federal Government to extradite him.\n\nAfenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, asked Malami to do the right thing and release Kanu and Igboho.\n\nAdebanjo stated, \u201cIt (Malami\u2019s statement) is welcome; let the government do the right thing. We don\u2019t enjoy them doing the wrong thing. If they do the right thing, we will encourage them. After all, we want this country to move forward. But nobody will encourage them when they put this country on the map to disgrace us.\n\n\u201cPeople are clamouring for freedom and you say they are terrorists. I disagree with him (Malami), particularly being a lawyer. Let them release them (Igboho and Kanu); they are freedom fighters. We are in a constitutional democracy; don\u2019t give them the impression that they are criminals.\u201d\n\nThe President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, advised the Federal Government to \u201clearn a lesson from history by not fighting an unwinnable war against nationalism, but seek possible peaceful options that are the only solution that guarantees national unity and peaceful co-existence.\u201d\n\nThe group made this known in a statement titled, \u2018Ohanaeze Commends Federal Government for Mulling Dialogue\u2019, signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Alex Ogbonnia.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe Malami enthusiasm on the option of a political solution to the security challenges in Nigeria reflects the views of Ohanaeze Ndigbo that the Igbo nation is not at war with Nigeria and has nothing pending before any institutional authority that demands a separate existence from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe common Igbo refrain is equity and justice. Therefore, it is hoped that a political solution to the current security challenges will go a long way in sustaining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Made Kuti: Life In Music",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Josephine Agbonkhese\n\nChristened Omorinmade Anikulapo-Kuti, afrobeat singer, songwriter and instrumentalist, known professionally as Made Kuti, is the grandson of legendary Fela Anikulapo-Kuti and the son of Femi Kuti.\n\nMade\u2019s early years were spent growing up in the New Afrika Shrine where he was surrounded by music early on \u2013fiddling with instruments as a toddler. He played the trumpet at three, took to the alto sax at five, picked up the piano at age eight, the drums and guitar at twelve, and the bass at fifteen.\n\nThe alumnus of Trinity Laban Conservatoire, London, and Founder, The Movement, a new generation Afrobeat band, has been a major force in his father\u2019s band, Positive Force, playing at legendary venues like, Glastonbury and the Hollywood Bowl since age eight.\n\nMade, who released his debut album titled \u201cForeward\u201d in 2021, with which he addresses Nigeria\u2019s many societal ills, speaks of his life, music and style in this interview with Allure.\n\nWhat was growing up as a young Kuti like?\n\nIt was a very liberating childhood: growing up around a lot of music and very conscious people. My father wasn\u2019t the type to have trivial conversations; so, whenever we sat down to talk, which was very often, it was often about character, the world, music, life and death, the future, the past, and anything that left me thinking. I was very lucky to be able to ask questions and get honest answers as well.\n\nDid you also grow up in the shrine? What was the experience like?\n\nYes, I did. It was everything a child could dream of. My dad played four times every week, so, I got to be a part of this massive musical movement with four to five thousand people coming to every show at the time. During the day, I would walk off to visit friends, to play football, and sometimes, to just find new places to see. I didn\u2019t have a bedtime during holidays, and I could disturb customers at the shrine by being a troublesome young boy jumping over empty tables. But none of that distracted me from the value of the music, the message it was carrying, the mission my father was on, and the beautiful things the shrine represented. It was really just a free-learning experience.\n\nWould you say music chose you or the thought of being a Kuti made you choose music?\n\nMusic chose me. But it\u2019s also fair to say music overwhelmed my space; so, it was very easy for it to inspire, influence my tastes and ignite my passion for it as it has.\n\nHow would you describe your kind of music?\n\nProgressive Afrobeat. Music that understands what has been,what is, and what it can be. Music that explores and represents values that I cherish, by carrying what I learn and experience through it.\n\nYou\u2019re a multi-instrumentalist; which instrument is your favourite?\n\nI try to practice all of them fairly evenly. It\u2019s too difficult to pick a favourite because they each allow me to express myself in different ways.\n\nHow does being the grandson of the legendary Fela Anikulapo-Kuti influence your genre of music?\n\nVery much so. Mostly because of being intelligent enough as a musician to understand musically just how exceptional Fela was. But, I feel the same way about my father, studying how he pushed the boundaries of the genre with albums like Shoki Shoki and Fight To Win.\n\nYour lyrics sound very motivational rather than agitate; why the deviation?\n\nMy lyrics express my state of mind at the time of writing them. Over the past few years, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time reflecting on myself. I really believe some of the greatest challenges we have as individuals are the ones we face with ourselves. So, as I think of how to better myself and become a better brother, son, partner and citizen, I try to show my thought process through my lyrics and music.\n\nWhat contemporary twist do you try to bring to the lineage?\n\nMusical exploration. Listening, learning, absorbing, and then creating. Trying to find musical universes, Afrobeat has not yet traveled.\n\nWhat inspired your band\u2019s name The Movement and what year was it launched?\n\nIt was launched this year 2021 in February. I wanted a name that represented everything I wanted the band to be about. Movement like groove and dance, but also, the ideological goals of the band of the music being progressive, positive, and conscious. So, it\u2019s a movement of the mind and of the body.\n\nDescribe your relationship with your father Femi Kuti\u2026\n\nA blessing. I am equipped to experience life as a young man in a country like this because of the way he raised me by being so present, and honest; and having the kind of attributes a young boy would like to see in his father and respect. He was always very physically strong, and goal-orientated. He used to do a thousand push-ups and sit-ups each day, and still practice his instruments for 10 to 12 hours. It was the level of respect I have for him, and the time he intentionally made out for me as his son, that has kept me grounded.\n\nHow do you successfully manage a band and still work for your father\u2019s band?\n\nWe\u2019re still trying to find a balance. I\u2019ll be going on tour with my father\u2019s band for a month soon and we\u2019ll see how it goes when I\u2019m back. What I know is, it\u2019s a very comfortable environment; so, I can feel relaxed as I navigate it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with other artists?\n\nOver the past year, I\u2019ve worked with the Cavemen, Runtown, Kida Kudz, and Korede Bello. They\u2019ve been absolutely wonderful. The Cavemen in particular have been like brothers since I came back to Lagos.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most interesting thing about being a Kuti?\n\nThe diverse misinterpretations about our reality.\n\nYour relationship with your mum is enviable; how has she been an influence?\n\nMy mom has been such a massive support pillar and genius mastermind since I started my career. So much of what has gone on in the band and for the band, have been thanks to her and her company, FK Management. From costumes, to everyday clothes, to shows, sponsorships, event management and planning, major future plans, you name it. She\u2019s been here breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for us; really believing in what we are doing and what we stand for.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI spend time with my family. Maybe gist and watch a movie with my partner, play Fifa with my dad, chess with my little brothers, or watch how my youngest sister is growing and outsmarting all of us. Treated myself for the first time in a long time with a trip to Jara Beach Resort with my partner and it was absolutely amazing.\n\nDescribe your fashion sense?\n\nIt was very bad until we started working with my friend and stylist Dolapo Bello. He owns Braimien. Because of him, all of a sudden, everyone thinks I actually have great fashion sense; but it\u2019s really just him being incredibly creative by knowing my character/personality and taste, and creating outfits that suit them. He\u2019s amazing.",

Because of him, all of a sudden, everyone thinks I actually have great fashion sense; but it\u2019s really just him being incredibly creative by knowing my character/personality and taste, and creating outfits that suit them. He\u2019s amazing.",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nThe importance of good skincare cannot be over-emphasized and what better way to learn and achieve total wellness of the skin, than to speak with top celebrity skincare specialist Okiemute Tonye Pela. Founder of PELS International, a top-notch skincare brand currently making the buzz on and off social media, Pela understands the necessity of skincare maintenance and stands by a team-based approach towards wellness for all of his clients.\n\nA graduate of International Business from Bells University of Technology, Ota, Ogun State, Pela realized early that his career aspirations centered on skin wellness, and on the dream of running his own skincare line. A few years ago, he made it happen with the launch of Pels International.\n\nOver the years, Pela has perfected the art of dermatological care through inputs from professionals, scientists, skin enthusiasts, and chemists, in formulating products to meet and satisfy clients\u2019 unique skin needs and desires.\n\nHe shares his beauty journey with Allure.\n\nWhat was your inspiration for starting PELS International?\n\nI have always been passionate about skincare products. As a young person, I found myself buying up skincare products whenever I went to beauty stores. I even bought things I didn\u2019t need, and then when I saw a person with any skin disorder, I always itcheed to give them solutions. I was even doing all of this for free.\n\nDo you have formal training in skincare?\n\nAfter my university days, I traveled to Manila Philippines to further my research and knowledge in the skincare industry. I discovered various secrets, and found out that most products that work for Asians also work for African skin. I discovered certain advanced natural skincare components that can improve skin texture, pigmentation, and radiance, without negative side effects. Furthermore, I always attended trade and beauty shows across the globe to enhance my knowledge and creativity, meet with other experts in my field and exchange business ideas.\n\nWhat is the philosophy behind the brand?\n\nPELS international is an overall skincare brand that caters to all skin types, genders, complexions and people of all ages- young and old. Our aim is to offer top-notch skincare and beauty services that will provide ultimate transformation, by completely eradicating any pressing skin issues, using the best and most advanced skincare ingredients.\n\nWhat sort of skin results can PELS deliver? What skin issues is it really great for?\n\nWith our life-changing products, Pels offers tremendous results for acne, post acne scars, hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone and discoloration, stretch marks, loose skin, Rosacea, Eczema as well as dehydrated skin. Basically, we handle different skin issues.\n\nWe also offer personalized skincare products for individuals with special skin cases.\n\nHow do you prescribe your products to people to give a more holistic approach?\n\nWe mostly prescribe products after a skin consultation has been done. When a product is properly recommended and used correctly as advised, with the reveal of tremendous results, it brings a certain form of satisfaction both physically and mentally. We tend to have an excellent relationship with our clients, encourage them to use their products appropriately, and also, do a follow-up routine to make sure products are working as expected. This also motivates them to believe in the brand and it provides a level of comfort, confidence, and good customer-to-client relationships.\n\nWhat are the big don\u2019ts when it comes to skincare?\n\nThere are a lot of don\u2019ts when it comes to skincare. They include: (A) do not overly expose yourself to harsh weather conditions especially the scorching sun at noon as ultraviolet rays can damage the skin, and cause premature aging.\n\n(B)Do not use excessively hot water on your skin as this can lead to skin dryness by stripping your skin off its natural oils & moisture.\n\n(C) Refrain from constantly touching your face. As we go about our daily activities, our hands are exposed to germs and bacteria, and this can contaminate our face when touched with unclean hands. (D)Products containing steroids are not for long-term use.\n\n(E) Do not sleep with your makeup on.\n\n(F) Don\u2019t apply body creams on your face especially for individuals with sensitive or acne-prone faces.\n\n(G) Lastly, I\u2019d say there are what we call \u201cCosmetic claims\u201d, don\u2019t trust every tip you see on the internet as most beauty bloggers may not plan to hurt you, but may lack in-depth knowledge on certain topics. Also, don\u2019t believe every home remedy or DIYs. Please deal with an experienced professional or aesthetician.\n\nHow has social media impacted your business and your clients?\n\nSocial media has really impacted positively on our brand by making it easy to showcase our products and services, and also made us accessible to individuals from different parts of the world. We also share some tips and tricks on how to maintain total wellness of the skin.\n\nHow do you perform a thorough skin analysis on a client?\n\nOne of the major ways is, we study your skin\u2019s past, look into your present as well as your skincare regimen, and then guide you through having a future clean and clear skin. We also identify if you have dry, oily, normal or combination skin, and if you have acne-prone skin or stretch mark prone skin, etc. There are, also, certain skin analysis machines, but another helpful way is dealing with sincere clients that will honestly elaborate on what they do with their skin at home.\n\nIn your opinion, do you think internal health is a growing area in the beauty industry?\n\nOh, I\u2019d say yes, because so far, we have various things dealing with internal health that relates to beauty. For example, we have dieticians, we have various immune boosters-both oral and intravenous, several anti-aging drinks and cocktails etc. I also feel there is more awareness and an increasing population presently focusing on their internal health, you go to pharmacies and you\u2019d see several supplements that improve skin health. We have glutathione, we have collagen, we have stem cells, there are also different medical and cosmetic procedures that enhance beauty.\n\nIs your product gender-based?\n\nNo, our products are not gender-based as we have both male and female clients.\n\nMost men are really not bothered about skincare as they believe it is solely for women; as a man in the beauty industry, what is your view on this and on such men?\n\nI\u2019d implore men to also focus on skincare and self-care and also practice masculine hygiene: pay proper attention to themselves, use roll-ons and body spray that are antiperspirants, to prevent body odour as most men are more exposed to tougher, daily, physical activities. We also promote good aftercare products, to prevent bumps from shaving and also deal with acne.\n\nThese days a lot of women are interested in skin bleaching or lightening products. Is Pels producing for this set of clients?\n\nYes, there is a rise in the skin lightening practice, and we have products that can help improve the texture, clarity, and overall complexion of your skin, by properly exfoliating and polishing the surface of your skin without high-end products. These products will deal with hyper-pigmentations, uneven skin, discoloration and can gently tone the complexion without making your skin thin or looking bleached.\n\nWhat do you think is the most challenging aspect of beauty therapy?\n\nThat is a broad question but for me, I feel cosmetic procedures that are done surgically are really a challenging aspect of beauty therapy as they can be life-threatening or lead to somebody\u2019 deformation if thorough medical checkups and investigations are not carried out. Also, if there is no proper aftercare, and if the procedure wasn\u2019t done by an experienced professional. Then in my field, a challenging aspect is when clients are not sincere about their regimen at home, also when they don\u2019t have patience when using products, expecting an overnight result. You can also have a challenge when clients feel because a product worked for their friend, they go ahead to buy without consulting forgetting that skin differs.\n\nWhat or who inspires you in life?\n\nMany things inspire me especially when it comes to my brand; I love the smiles and satisfaction on my clients\u2019 faces. It encourages me to do better. For me, my job is a gift from above. I operate in a mysterious way. It is really a God-given gift. Most times, I even fall into a state of trance when it comes to product and ingredient selection during my research and discovery.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nI love that I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m so passionate about, it gives me joy to create reliable skincare solutions. I\u2019m always excited when I get a call and hear \u201cPels that product is magical,\u201d it really gladdens my heart.\n\nWhat advice would you give to your younger self?\n\nNone. I feel like I am doing great, and my timeline is also okay. I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d do anything differently. I\u2019m glad to be living my dream and doing a job that I am passionate about. I don\u2019t hold myself back on anything.\n\nSo much has changed over the last year, in terms of COVID, the economy, and all. How did you cope and what lessons did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was so unexpected; it taught us to be prepared for anything. While having positive expectations, we shouldn\u2019t forget that anything can go wrong. The experience has taught me to really solidify the foundation of my company/brand as we have no idea what the future holds. It also made us create alternative platforms on how to run business smoothly, especially using our online website, and dispatch methods to easily deliver our products to clients. And then, we also had to improvise by engaging in video conferencing and consultations via telephone social media. Also, we upgraded our hygiene and safety measures in the office. Funny enough, COVID-19 didn\u2019t affect our sales. Because most people spent time at home, they also paid more attention to their skin which means more sales.\n\nYou went through a dramatic change with your body, how were you able to achieve this?\n\nIt all boils down to discipline, consistency, diet, exercise and fitness. It was a whole mental thing, you really have to put in the work. Also, I got motivated once I saw it started paying off. I felt more confident and now, it\u2019s a way of life for me.\n\nWhat advice do you have for people who put in the work but get little results for their effort?\n\nMost people experience difficulty due to lack of knowledge in this field. I used a dietician and I saw massive changes, and became more aware of what to eat, time to eat and also portion control.\n\nWould you support them to go under the knife for cosmetic surgeries?\n\nFirst, I would say before considering cosmetic surgery, you have to make sure you have exhausted all possible options to lose weight. Dieticians and nutritionists are highly recommended as they play a major role in advising on daily calorie intake. I am definitely not against surgery because there are people who may need surgery; for example, a gastric bypass or any other procedure to control eating disorders or for individuals who struggle with obesity. But it\u2019s highly advisable to do a proper background check, make all your findings, and do a thorough health check-#up before undergoing any surgical procedure.\n\nWhere do you draw the line in search for the perfect look?\n\nNo one is perfect and as humans, we may have one imperfection or the other. I\u2019d say, fix what you can and educate yourself properly when going skin deep. Try to be careful and avoid life- threatening procedures. If your life is on the line, please have a rethink especially if it\u2019s cosmetic surgery. Adhere to your doctor\u2019s instructions properly.\n\nFor the man, what should be the limit of beauty search for them?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is a limit with beauty but I strongly advise and urge men to take proper care of themselves, indulge in proper, personal hygiene and self care. Beauty, skincare or self care is not meant for women alone.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the just concluded Anambra State governorship election, Senator Andy Uba, has formally rejected the outcome of the poll. He equally threatened to reclaim his \u2018stolen mandate\u2019 through all constitutional means available.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Spokesperson, Senator Andy Uba Campaign Organization, Ambassador Jerry Ugokwe, Uba maintained that there was no way the carcass of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) could have defeated the APC without active collusion and manipulation by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Willie Obiano-led administration.\n\nAccording to the statement; \u201cThe Sen Andy Uba Campaign Organization has rejected the result of the just-concluded Anambra State governorship election as declared by INEC. The outcome of the election was a charade and did not reflect the wishes of the people of Anambra State.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur popular candidate, Senator Andy Uba is a victim of widespread electoral fraud and manipulation by INEC in cohorts with the Willie Obiano Regime and the security forces deployed to oversee the Anambra State Governorship Election.\n\n\u201cThe elections were characterised by widespread irregularities, intimidation and voter suppression in order to clear the path for the inglorious \u2018victory\u2019 of APGA in the polls.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in polling units where the Biometric Voters\u2019 Accreditation System malfunctioned, INEC went ahead to conduct the elections manually. There were numerous cases where votes announced by INEC exceeded the number of accredited voters in polling units.\n\n\u201cAnother clear manifestation of collusion between the Obiano administration and INEC was the publishing of results on the Social Media handles of APGA even before official announcement by INEC. Yet mysteriously, the votes announced in advance by APGA always corresponded correctly with the official figures released by INEC.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that our candidate, who polled over 200,000 votes in the APC primary election would be allocated a slightly above 43,000 votes by INEC. It is surprising that APGA that lost almost 80 per cent of its stalwarts through defection to the APC before the election came out \u2018victorious\u2019.\n\n\u201cA sitting APGA Deputy Governor, seven members of the House of Representatives, 10 members of the Anambra State House of Assembly, the APGA party\u2019s member of Board of Trustees, many serving SA\u2019s, SSA\u2019s, in addition to a serving PDP Senator all defected to the APC very timely before the election, yet APGA emerged \u2018victorious\u2019. This is quite ridiculous!\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, the only people remaining in APGA at the time of the election were Governor Obiano and his household and a few staff of the Government House as well as Prof. Soludo and his household but majority of the electorates in Anambra State have moved to the APC.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely no way the carcass of APGA could have defeated the APC without the active collusion and manipulation by INEC and the Obiano-led administration.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on November 6, 2021 fell far below the acceptable standard of a free and fair election and can best be described as an electoral fraud perpetrated by the INEC, Willie Obiano Administration and the security forces.\n\n\u201cWe have noted that starting from the appointment of INEC Adhoc staff, who mostly came from Calabar, to the distribution of electoral materials and the retention of the Resident Electoral Commissioner, who supervised the second term election of Governor Obiano, it was crystal clear that the game plan was to overturn the popular wishes of the people of Anambra State in the biggest electoral heist of all time in Nigeria\u2019s political history.\n\n\u201cWhile we appeal to our supporters to remain peaceful and calm, we will not relent in pursuing our stolen electoral mandate to the limit of the law through all the constitutional means available as the facts on ground did not in any way reflect the outcome of the elections as announced by the obviously compromised INEC,\u201d the statement read.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nAgain, controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi, is in the eye of the storm following his advice to the Federal Government to give land and money to bandits so that they could stop killing Nigerians.\n\nIn a live stream on his Facebook page on Tuesday, he said past attempts to broker peace with bandits failed because they were not compensated \u201cwith lands or cattle or money big enough to help halt hostilities.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nHowever, the Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, Yoruba self-determination group, Ilano Omo Oodua (IOO), and other eminent Nigerians said his comment is akin to ceding part of Nigerian lands to foreigners.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonna described Gumi\u2019s advice as condemnable and urged the government to, as a matter of urgency, investigate him.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\n\u201cHe is a security threat to Nigeria because from all indications, he knows and relates with the bandits. Gumi\u2019s position in Nigeria is very clear; he is a security threat. He lives a double life. The one he sees as religious life, that is his public life is completely at variance with his life as an associate of bandits. The government should investigate him and deal with him seriously,\u201d he stated.\n\nFor the president of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, it is unfortunate that a cleric, who is supposed to be showing people the way is the one misleading people.\n\nHe wondered how Gumi expects government to reward criminals who derive pleasure in killing innocent people.\n\n\u201cHow can you reward killers? With whose land and whose money?\u201d he queried.\n\n\u201cThe government should deal with the bandits. If Gumi wants to join them, he is free to do that but no piece of Nigeria\u2019s land will be given to the bandits.\u201d\n\nHe noted that many of the bandits were foreigners and listening to Gumi\u2019s advice would only amount to ceding part of Nigeria to foreigners.\n\n\u201cIt will not happen and I don\u2019t believe this government will tow that line. No wise, sane government will tow that line,\u201d he stated.\n\nProf. Banji Akintoye\u2019s Yoruba self-determination group, Ilano Omo Oodua (IOO) also lashed out at Gumi for his suggestion.\n\nThe group said Gumi is representing an interest and the suggestion has vindicated its position that what is happening in Nigeria is a state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nIOO Media and Publicity Officer, Maxwell Adeleye, wondered why the Federal Government is persecuting Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known Sunday Igboho and other self-determination groups, who neither bear arms nor kill but has refused to arrest and prosecute Gumi who openly associates with terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is an actual vindication of those of us in Ilano Omo Oodua and Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self Determination (NINAS) that what is going on in Nigeria is state-sponsored terrorism. We know what Gumi represents; it is clear that he is representing an interest. He has been openly associating with terrorists and posing for pictures with them, yet he is walking the streets free while Sunday Igboho and other self determination groups are languishing in jail. The Niger Delta militants were protesting the degradation of their environment by crude oil spillage that has prevented them from fishing and farming, but what are the so-called bandits protesting for; what are their grievances? These people masquerading as bandits are terrorists, their mission is to make their region ungovernable so that they will be paid part of the crude oil money from the Niger Delta.

          "text": "\u2022Confidence in Nigeria\u2019s business environment growing, Says Emefiele\n\n\u2022CBN Governor predicts external reserves to surpass $42bn by mid-2022\n\n\u2022Rabiu seeks measures to fast-track growth, development in Africa\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, France\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has painted a rosy picture of Nigeria\u2019s economy saying its outlook\n\nremains bright with sustained investments in infrastructure, particularly in ICT.\n\nHe stressed that Nigeria\u2019s business environment favours global businesses and has a friendly regulatory environment that supports Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs).\n\nBuhari said this while delivering a keynote address yesterday in Paris, France, during the one-day Nigeria International Partnership Forum, with focus on, \u201cBeyond the Pandemic.\u2019.\n\nThis is just as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who also spoke at same forum yesterday, disclosed that confidence in the Nigerian business environment was growing due to sustained policy interventions in the economy. Overall, Emefiele said the business confidence index was projected at 37.7 index points in November 2021 and 57.6 index points by mid-2022.\n\nContinuing, President Buhari said the nation\u2019s economy was being re-engineered and re-positioned to be globally more competitive, favouring business and entrepreneurship to drive growth and development.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cFor us in Nigeria, lessons drawn from the pandemic prompted us to redouble efforts to mitigate its socio-economic effects. Despite prevailing uncertainties, our equitable and sustainable reform initiatives resulted in substantial economic gains and steady recovery.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that our administration is on the right path to achieving multi-sectoral progress. We have revitalised the economy by increasing investments in capacity building, health, infrastructure, women\u2019s empowerment, climate change, and food security.\n\n\u201cToday, these actions are yielding self-employment, expanding our human resource pool and strengthening our national productivity for sustainable development.\u201d\n\nThe President assured investors of the country\u2019s willingness to create a win-win at every point.\n\n\u201cI am proud to reiterate our resolve to reduce and ultimately eliminate obstacles to access and retention of FDI. Our investment-friendly policies are backed by the rule of law, practical security policies and a resilient population.\n\n\u201cLet me finally stress that Nigeria is open for partnership and cooperation. I invite the French business community to take advantage of the vast investment opportunities in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cAs our development partners, rest assured that we will stand together with you throughout our partnership journey to guarantee our mutual interest.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told a gathering of French and Nigerian businessmen that the government recognised the nation\u2019s risk profile and decided to re-assess and update the National Security Strategy in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of this multi-sectoral strategy has contributed to the progress we have made in fighting insurgents and terrorists in the north-east of the country. Working closely with international partners, we are firmly addressing the root causes of crimes, and taking measures to prevent and counter violent extremism,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n\u201cAs I said at the fifth edition of the Future Investment Initiative Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, investing in humanity is investing in our collective survival.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, we have incorporated the Public-Private Partnership model into our economic recovery plan, to attract private sector participation in the financing and operations of critical economic and social infrastructure. This measure is already helping to mitigate COVID-19 triggered capital flight and decline in grant and development financing.\n\n\u201cAlso, at the just concluded COP26 in Glasgow, I stressed the link between modern infrastructure and the overall economic development of a nation. Hence, the massive infrastructure expansion programme, we have been executing in various sectors since the beginning of this administration. 1.5 trillion Dollars is the cumulative amount estimated to be spent within a period of ten years from 2015,\u201d the president added.\n\nAccording to him, his administration has made significant investments in railways, seaports, roads, renewable energy, housing and many others attractive to prospective investors. He said institutions such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority and the recently created Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria are run as independent world class institutions to support and facilitate investments in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari stressed that opportunities in the mining sector had been expanded, with simplified licensing process, extensive investments in transportation of raw materials, equipment and other mining elements by road and by rail.\n\nAccording to him, to keep the progress in the digital economy, the fastest growing sector in Nigeria in both 2020 and 2021 on track, government recently approved the national policy on Fifth Generation (5G) network.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur ultimate goal is to leverage ICT platforms to spur further investments and create jobs, while diversifying support to other emerging sectors. Already, several foreign investors are taking advantage of our recent ranking as the leading start-up ecosystem in Africa.\n\n\u201cOver a week ago, I launched the eNaira, the electronic version of our national currency. When fully operationalised, this innovation will increase participation in fin-tech within Nigeria, increase efficiency in the banking sector, and boost our capacity to combat illicit flow of funds,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president said the oil sector was also getting more attention to expand opportunities with the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\n\u201cOur plan is to increase Liquefied Natural Gas exports and expand our domestic market. Partnerships in textile and leather processing, tourism, and health sectors are also areas we can explore,\u2019\u2019 he further explained.\n\nThe president noted that the agricultural sector, through Anchor Borrowers Programme, provided loans and technical support to small holder farmers, leading to the expansion in the number of rice mills in Nigeria from 10 in 2014 to 40 today.\n\n\u201cThe country has also increased the number of active fertilizer blending plants to more than forty-six, from fewer than five in 2014.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we have set aside several million hectares of available arable land for agriculture, and have embarked on the creation of Special Agriculture Processing Zones across the country,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, Emefiele pointed out that headline inflation in the country was also expected to moderate to 15.35 per cent by December 2021 and 14.91 per cent by February 2022, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, he anticipated that core inflation would fall to 13.39 percent in December 2021 from 13.74 per cent in October 2021. \u201cThis is due to the favourable impact of the various CBN and government interventions in the agriculture and the real sector, the moderation of supply side constraints and the gradual increase in domestic economic activity, which is expected to keep prices low in the near-term,\u201d Emefiele told his audience.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria\u2019s external reserves would surpass $42 billion by mid-2022. This, according to the CBN Governor was due to sustained increase in crude oil price, the impact of Eurobond Issuance, and the stable exchange rate condition.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the recent launch of the eNaira would improve the conduct of monetary policy in Nigeria, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion in the medium to long term.\n\n\u201cWe expect an increase in the availability of credit through the CBN intervention programmes to increase aggregate demand and stimulate growth in key sectors that face credit constraints.\n\n\u201cWe expect higher revenue due to stronger revenue administration efforts by the fiscal authorities,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CBN Governor reiterated that the take-off of the Dangote refinery and the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which were expected to expand the fiscal space of government in the medium to long term, would also boost growth.\n\nIn addition, Emefiele told the gathering of foreign investors and global political leaders and diplomats that improvement in crude oil prices were expected to provide stability to Nigeria\u2019s external reserves and exchange rate.\n\nAs part of efforts to drive the diversification of the Nigerian economy, the CBN said policies had been developed to reduce import of goods that could be produced in the country in order to create employment opportunities for Nigerians, reawaken Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing industry and reposition them for the AFCFTA.\n\nHe pointed out that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian economy had been on a positive growth trajectory and had witnessed 12 consecutive quarters of positive growth following the 2016 to 2017 recession, along with significant foreign capital inflows due to improved fundamentals of the economy.\n\nInflation rate rose to 18.17 per cent in March 2021 from 12.12 per cent in January 2020, and external reserves declined to about $34.3 billion in May 2021, from nearly $36.7 billion in January 2020.\n\nAlso then, market turnover on the Investors and Exporters\u2019 window declined significantly too, from an average of $262.3 million daily in 2019, to about $44 million at the height of COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy rebounded after two quarters of contraction. The economy witnessed growth of 0.11 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 from -3.62 percent in the third quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil and services sectors were the major contributors to growth in the fourth quarter. Headline inflation rate decreased to 16.63 percent in September 2021 from 18.17 percent in March 2020 and external reserves grew to nearly $41.5 billion.\n\n\u201cThe quick recovery from the recession was due to targeted interventions in the critical sectors of the economy, monetary and exchange rate policies to stabilise exchange rate, the implementation of the Economic Sustainability Plan, and the nationwide improvement in vaccine administration and coverage,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile noting that the immediate effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria was felt through the loss of means of livelihood for many households during the lockdown, Emefiele highlighted various measures the CBN adopted to support households and firms in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nSome of these included creating a N100 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank; creating a N100 billion intervention fund in loans to support pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners and to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions; creating a N1 trillion facility in loans to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors; and creating a research fund, which was designed to support the development of vaccines in Nigeria.\n\nHighlighting the CBN\u2019s medium term policies to tackle COVID-19, he listed some of these to include the granting approval of three payment bank licenses which would accelerate the provision of digital financial services by bank and non-bank institutions and reduce the need for paper money; implementation of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) to promote entrepreneurial activities and foster job creation among Nigerian youths, and supporting the Auto-Gas Conversion Programme of the federal government.\n\nOn the other hand, he listed the CBN\u2019s long term policies to tackle COVID-19 to include the establishment of the InfraCo to address the funding challenges in financing the development of critical infrastructure which would act as a catalyst for growth in the medium and the long run while providing reasonable returns to investors.\n\nOthers are the planned establishment of the CBN CPP intervention to develop the human capital needed to build capacity in the financial sector.\n\n\u201cThrough this program, the CBN will produce a critical mass of well-educated postgraduate degree holders in the fields of Accounting, Banking and Finance, Business Administration and Economics for the financial services industry, and the Nigerian economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe creation of a Central Bank Digital Currency, or the eNaira, to support post COVID economic growth. The eNaira will increase financial inclusion, improve the conduct of monetary policy, and facilitate low-cost and efficient payments.\n\n\u201cThe impact of our policy measures helped to prevent larger GDP contractions in 2020, as projected by analysts. Unfolding developments continue to indicate that the Nigerian economy will achieve strong growth while current inflation trends remain on track towards their desired levels,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his presentation, the Founder/Executive Chairman of the BUA Group, Abdul Samad Rabiu, also called for a three-way partnership between the African private sector, government and finance institutions to fast-track growth and development in Nigeria, and in Africa.\n\nAccording to Rabiu, who is the President of the France Nigeria Business Council, the partnership will identify sustainable solutions to the issues of infrastructure, climate and industrialisation.\n\nSpeaking at the Forum in Paris, France, Abdul Samad Rabiu noted that despite the challenges occasioned by the global pandemic, African governments must work with the private sector across board to develop sustainable policies that will aid investments and innovation while financial institutions must move with the times and come up with more innovative approaches to support growth in the continent.\n\nAccording to Abdul Samad Rabiu, the Nigeria Partnership Forum was timely and a welcome development \u2013 especially for Nigeria and the rest of Africa, in the face of increasing global economic uncertainty and challenges brought about by the latest global pandemic.\n\n\u201cNumerous opportunities for global partnerships exist across Nigeria and Africa. Key amongst this is in the infrastructure space. By increasing our investments in infrastructure, creating access between borders, encouraging the free movement of goods and services under the AfCFTA, and opening up the continent, it is expected that supply chains will become more efficient, trade would be bolstered, new industries and industrial bases will emerge while intra-African integration would be enhanced. All of these will ensure that Nigerians and Africans will be better off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need to see more three-way partnerships between the African private sector, governments and Development Finance institutions to fast-track growth. I believe conversations in this important forum will touch on this topic while also challenging our approach towards the future of Nigeria and the African continent. We can all agree that there are challenges but while they may appear numerous, we cannot give up or choose to remain docile in our bid to accelerate development and innovation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe National Security Adviser to the President, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd); Nigeria\u2019s Special Envoy on Chad and Lake Chad Basin, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe; Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of State, Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama also gave an overview on key sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\nSome other business leaders from Nigeria at the event included Founder and Chairman of Oriental Energy Resources, Mohammed Indimi; Chairman/Editor-In-Chief of THISDAY Group and Arise News Channel, Nduka Obiagbena; and Founder/Chairman of Zenith Bank, Jim Ovia, Chairman of Heirs Holdings and UBA, Tony Elumelu.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Promises quality leadership\n\n\u2022Defectors have started begging to come back, says Oye\n\n\u2022Buhari to gov-elect: I look forward to working with you\n\n\u2022Fayemi, Saraki, Gbajabiamila, Ozigbo, Ubah, others congratulate winner\n\n\u2022TMG demands improved INEC equipment, end to vote-buying\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Emma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Hammed Shittu in Ilorin, Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nAnambra State governor-elect and candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Soludo, yesterday unveiled his agenda for the state on the ARISE News Channel, in his first post-victory television interview. Soludo promised to run an all-inclusive government that would focus on problem-solving and value addition to the state.\n\nIn the interview with the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, shortly after he was declared winner of the governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday, Soludo pledged to hit the ground running and demonstrate quality leadership at a fast pace.\n\nHe said he would pursue peace and unite the people in order to bring the much-needed value to the state.\n\nSoludo was declared winner of the November 6 governorship election after polling a total of 112,229 votes to defeat his closest rival, Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who scored 53, 807 votes to emerge second. Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) got a total of 43,285 votes to emerge third, while Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) came fourth with 21,261 votes.\n\nUbah won in one local government, just as Ozigbo, while Soludo won in the remaining 19 local government areas.\n\nThe Returning Officer for the 2021 Anambra State governorship election, Florence Obi, announced the final results in the early hours of Wednesday at the INEC headquarters in Awka.\n\nNot unexpectedly, National Chairman of APGA, Chief Victor Oye, who also spoke on Arise News Channel, said he had started receiving calls from some of those, who had defected to other political parties at the heat of the election, but were now willing to return. Oye said the party would welcome them back if they showed sufficient remorse and true repentance.\n\nMeanwhile, congratulatory messages have begun to pour in for Soludo, with President Muhammadu Buhari, not only congratulating the governor-elect, but also saying he looks forward to working with him in the collective interest of the country.\n\nEkiti State Governor and Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the Saturday election, Valentine Ozigbo; and former PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, congratulated Soludo for a victory well deserved.\n\nEqually identifying with the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), were a former national publicity secretary of the PDP, Chief Olisa Metuh; former presidential hopeful and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim; and governorship candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP), Ifeanyi Ubah, among others.\n\nSimilarly, foremost civil society election observation organisation in Nigeria, the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), called for improvement of election equipment by INEC, especially, its newly introduced Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nInterestingly, Soludo\u2019s victory at the just concluded governorship election reverberated in neighbouring Abia State, with a resurgence of hope among the APGA faithful for electoral ahead of 2023.\n\nSpeaking to his plans for Anambra, Soludo said, \u201cWe have fought a political fight and we have gone to court and now is the time for us to come together to build the state. The incumbent governor wanted me to succeed him among all other contestants, and he worked hard to ensure that APGA won the election.\n\n\u201cNow that APGA has won, and the governor-elect has emerged, it is time for us to work as a political party and also extend our friendship to other party members in the state, in order to build the state.\u201d\n\nHe said anyone willing to support the state would be welcomed, saying, \u201cIt is about bringing value to the people and I will work with those who will bring value to the people, and turn Anambra State into an industrial hub that we all envisage. I will reach out to them in the \u2018Anambra Spirit\u2019 in order to develop the state together.\u201d\n\nAsked about his plan for women and youth representation in his government, Soludo said, \u201cThere will not be a dramatic change in women and youth representation in my government, because I will be focusing on problem solving. If the women and youth show the capacity to deliver, so be it, and I will engage them to deliver on value.\n\n\u201cWhen I was Central Bank Governor, I gave responsibilities that had to do with trust and integrity to the women, and they never disappointed me. Anambra has a youthful population and I will not discriminate between gender in my administration, and, above all, my manifesto is a youthful manifesto.\u201d\n\nSoludo assured the people of Anambra State that anybody with useful values to offer would be engaged to do so.\n\nOn the transition process and how he would run the state after the swearing-in ceremony in March next year, Soludo said he had some experience in governance in the past, having managed huge bureaucracies with six parastatals, long before becoming Governor of CBN.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have understanding of a few things on how government and institutions work, and the bureaucracy in governance. Again, my governorship will be a continuation of APGA government, so, I expect a very seamless transition process and good governance.\u201d\n\nSoludo said he would not have begrudged anybody if he had lost the election, but would simply have thanked God.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn 2010, I was conscripted to run for election in Anambra State, and when I lost the election to the former governor, I congratulated him two hours after INEC declared him winner of the election, and I walked away after the thanksgiving service. Also in 2013, I was disqualified from contesting the election under APGA and I did not leave the party because of my disqualification. But I remained in the party and still supported the party.\n\n\u201cI have persevered after loosing election twice in the state, and I believe this is the right time that God Almighty has planned for me to emerge as winner. Now is the time for me to serve the people of the state and I see it as a divine journey for me, and I am grateful to God and to all the people of Anambra State, including the judiciary, and President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nThe former CBN governor believed his victory was divine, stressing that he would not be overwhelmed by his triumph at the poll. He said his focus would be the enormity of the work ahead of him as governor.\n\nAsked the possibility of APGA winning elections outside Anambra State and becoming a regional and national political party, he said the name of the party, which was registered since 2002, would continue to speak volumes for the party\u2019s mission of becoming both a regional and national political party.\n\n\u201cThe first election that APGA won was in the South-east, and we will continue to work hard as progressives to stretch our winning strategies to other states across regions,\u201d Soludo said.\n\nOn his part, the APGA national chairman, while speaking on moves by defectors to return to the party, explained, \u201cFor me, people disagree to agree. You mentioned the deputy governor, nobody did anything to him. He just chose to embark on an adventure.\n\n\u201cHe was not denied anything. He had everything he should have. He had everything, but suddenly he jumped out of the team. So, how are you going to blame somebody who jumped out of a 21- storey building?\n\n\u201cWhat do you expect will happen to him? He will crash and end up blaming the building or the builder. All those people that left without justification, they went on sheer adventure, and some of them have been calling to return to the party. For me, they can come back if they show sufficient remorse, because APGA is a party for all of us.\u201d\n\nBuhari to Soludo: Rally stakeholders for transformational leadership\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, while rejoicing with Soludo, enjoined him, as a member of the Presidential Economic Advisory Committee, to rally other stakeholders to tackle the challenges confronting the state and the South-east, in general.\n\nBuhari, in a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, added that he looked forward to working with the incoming governor for the peace, security, and development of not only Anambra State, but the entire country.\n\nThe president also praised the security agencies for their determination to ensure that the election went on as smoothly as possible. He commended INEC for the successful conclusion of the exercise, despite the initial challenges encountered.\n\nDemocracy is the real winner \u2013 Fayemi\n\nFayemi said the Anambra election attested to Buhari\u2019s sincerity and commitment to delivery of a free, fair, and credible electoral system. The Ekiti State governor said democracy was the real winner at the Anambra election, with the successful and peaceful conduct of the poll.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, the governor said the will of the people of Anambra State, expressed through the ballot box, had prevailed. He hailed all stakeholders, including the electorate, INEC, security agencies, election observers, political parties, and their agents for working together to deliver an election devoid of violence.\n\nFayemi praised the people of Anambra State for their perseverance and tenacity in participating in the poll, despite some technical hitches that were recorded, and ensuring that their votes counted.\n\nSaraki: Anambra poll outcome has crucial lessons\n\nSaraki congratulated Nigerians, particularly, the people of Anambra State, for the success of the governorship election. He advised the people not to allow the crucial lessons, which the results of the election signified, to go unnoticed or be ignored.\n\nIn a statement by the head of his media office, Yusuph Olaniyonu, the former senate president commended the stakeholders and others, who initiated and participated in the dialogue that created the peaceful atmosphere for the election.\n\nHe praised the security agencies for the diligence and professionalism displayed by the officers and men on duty. He also lauded INEC for the successful deployment of technology to improve the election process, particularly, the adoption of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and electronic transmission of results.\n\nSaraki said, in the statement, \u201cThe Anambra State electorate has taught the rest of Nigeria a lesson about the need for people to vote according to their conscience, to conduct polls devoid of violence, and stand firm in defence of our votes.\n\n\u201cAll stakeholders also have to work on the issue of vote-buying. It is a problem, which we must find a solution to, otherwise, it will continue to undermine our democracy. These are some of the lessons from Anambra State, which must not be ignored.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila: Soludo coming with experience and skill\n\nIn a congratulatory letter to Soludo, Gbajabiamila said with the former CBN governor\u2019s antecedents as an accomplished professional, he believed the Anambra governor-elect would bring his experience and expertise to bear.\n\nGbajabiamila told Soludo in the letter, \u201cYou are taking office at a time of profound challenges and tremendous opportunity in our country. All of us, who hold public office, have an obligation at this moment in history to take active measures, guided by considerations of the best interests of our people, to overcome these challenges and provide conditions for our citizens to thrive.\n\n\u201cYou have in your professional life shown a tremendous capacity for effectiveness; you have demonstrated personal integrity and have already accomplished much more than most can ever hope for. I am confident that you will thrive in this new role, and your service will glorify God and elevate the people of Anambra State and all of Nigeria. I wish you success, and I assure you of my support.\u201d\n\nPDP candidate congratulates Soludo\n\nThe PDP candidate, Ozigbo, in a press statement he personally signed, said he had called and congratulated Soludo on his victory at the poll.\n\nOzigbo stated, \u201cI have just called Professor Chukwuma Soludo and congratulated him on being declared the winner of the Anambra State governorship election, 2021. I wished him well and prayed for his success.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to congratulate all the men and women, who contested our dear state\u2019s governorship this year. You all have shown a determination to see that Anambra is better. It was an honour to run this race with you.\u201d\n\nNdi Anambra have spoken, says Metuh\n\nMetuh said, in a statement, \u201cFinally, Ndi Anambra have spoken and their voices were heard loud and clear. They have, through their votes, democratically made their choice of who governs them for the next four years.\n\n\u201cThough the outcome of the election might not have swung the way some individuals, especially, those within the political circles, desired, but Ndi Anambra have spoken and their choice must be respected and accepted.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that I call on all Ndi Anambra, irrespective of political affiliations, to put politics and issues of the election behind and come together as one people that we are, and join hands with Prof. Soludo to chart a new course for our dear state. I implore contenders, who are hurting over the outcome of the election to sheathe their swords and put aside all personal interests for the sake of Ndi Anambra.\u201d\n\nOlawepo-Hashim: Nigeria is greatest winner\n\nOlawepo-Hashim commended Buhari for creating an atmosphere of non-interference in INEC\u2019s conduct of the election in Anambra State. In a statement by his media assistant, Mr. Segun Abifarin, Olawepo-Hashim said the victory belonged to Anambra and Nigeria, in general.\n\nHe congratulated the \u201ca wonderful person of Anambra State, who against all odds, filed out peacefully and performed their civic responsibilities,\u201d stressing, \u201cOur dear country Nigeria is the biggest winner. Glory to God as the country has again proven prophets of doom wrong.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians should celebrate this victory. Though my party, APC, did not come top in the final result, we can boast that our government created the atmosphere under which the votes of the electorate are beginning to count.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s democracy in action, says Secondus\n\nSecondus said by Soludo\u2019s victory, the people had spoken and democracy was in action. He said though he had desired his party, PDP, to come out victorious, \u201cas a true democrat, we will always respect the will of the people, where and when it\u2019s allowed to prevail.\u201d\n\nSecondus mocked the All Progressives Congress (APC) for trying to reap where it did not sow in the hope that untoward acts could give them victory.\n\nNLC calls for democratic reforms\n\nIn its congratulatory message, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) called for deeper reforms to democratise the appointment of the leadership of INEC, establish an Electoral Offences Commission, and the institutionalise proportional representation in Nigeria\u2019s constitution and electoral law.\n\nNLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said Soludo\u2019s victory was a testament to the confidence he enjoyed from majority of Anambrarians, but added that the advocated reforms represented a more sustainable recipe for deepened political process and value-laden democratic outcomes in Nigeria.\n\nAyuba stated, \u201cThis is the hallmark and beauty of democracy. There is no doubt that the consummation of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State was fraught with anxious moments, as many Nigerians followed the process with bated breath. The thuds of armoured tanks and the echoes of gunshots that trailed the campaign train turned the once peaceful state into a theatre of battles.\n\n\u201cThe dicey security situation was not helped with the agitations of the IPOB, especially, the sit-at-home order which hung a huge blanket of uncertainty over the November 6, 2021 election.\n\n\u201cWe commend the resolve of Anambra people to put the enemies of democracy to shame. Many voters in the state dared the pre-election day violence and showed up on election day to cast their ballot.\u201d\n\nIfeanyi Ubah: I won\u2019t challenge result in court\n\nThe YPP candidate, in a press statement, said, \u201cI have just called the newly elected governor of our dear state, Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, to congratulate him on his victory at the just concluded November 6, 2021 Anambra governorship poll.\n\n\u201cAs a democrat and law-abiding citizen, I wholeheartedly accept the outcome of the election and would like to use this medium to congratulate Prof. Charles Soludo on his victory. It is imperative to state that I do not intend to challenge the electoral results as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) through any court or judicial process.\u201d\n\nTMG tells INEC to improve use of technology\n\nTMG called for the improvement of election equipment, especially, the BVAS. It urged the security agencies to investigate and charge to court all security operatives, who engaged in violation of human rights, and gross misconduct during the election.\n\nChairman of the group, Comrade Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, noted that the pre-election season, which witnessed a lot of violence that marred campaign rallies of the various parties in parts of the state, eventually led to low voter turn out, an omen, he said, was bad for democracy.\n\nRafsanjani said, \u201cThe stand of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the strong presence of security operatives had an effect on how voters came out to exercise their franchise.\u201d He called on government to stand up to the challenges of insecurity in the country, so that the 2023 election would not witness voter apathy, as was the case in Anambra.\n\nVice Chairman of the group, Mrs. Miriam Menkiti, also lamented the poor performance of the BVAS, which she said frustrated voters across the 21 local government areas of Anambra State.\n\nMenkiti stated, \u201cIt is shocking that despite the consistent statement by INEC that the card readers were all set for the elections, we still witnessed a high rate of poor connection of the BVAS in various part of the state.\n\n\u201cTMG appeals to INEC to live up to the task of providing smooth elections for Nigerians in the 2023 general election, which will be cumbersome and overstretch the electoral umpire.\u201d\n\nSoludo gingers up APGA in Abia\n\nIn nearby Abia State, APGA members saw Soludo\u2019s victory as the sign of a political possibility in the state in 2023. Leader of Abia State chapter of APGA, Hon. Obinna Ichita, told journalists that the party received the outcome of the Anambra poll with great joy and high hope for better things ahead, as the 2023 general election drew near.\n\nIchita stated, \u201cWe (Abians) now know that it is normal to ply on good roads; it is normal to have potable water; it is normal to have quality healthcare services that APGA has provided in Anambra over the years.\u201d\n\nHe said come 2023, Ndi Abia could not afford to continue to entrust their collective destiny to PDP, which had over the past 20 years \u201cproved to be incompetent\u201d.\n\nIchita declared that APGA was a proven credible alternative.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Membership of the syndicate include suspects with backgrounds in public service, business, law, journalism, banking, amongst others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe facts of the case from Police Investigations have it that one Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, an acclaimed whistle blower, following a baseless and unverified information he got from one Yusuf Adamu \u2013 parading himself as the godson of Chief Peter Odili \u2013 that there is a huge sum of money in foreign currencies stashed in the residence of Her Lordship, Justice Mary Odili, located at No. 7, Imo River Street, Maitama, initiated processes aimed at illegally recovering the said money. Consequently, the syndicate contacted one Bashir Musa, a clerical staff of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who in turn sought the assistance of two (2) others \u2013 Shehu Jibo and Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nThe whistle blower was later introduced to one Bayero Lawal who falsely presented himself as a Director in EFCC. He took the whistle blower to one Hajiya Maimuna Maishanu who in turn took them to her cousin, Michael Diete-Spiff, who claimed to be the Director of Foreign Currency Operation of Ghost Accounts for Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Recovery Panel, purportedly operating under the Federal Ministry of Justice \u2013 an agency that in fact does not exist.\n\nDiete-Spiff later introduced the whistle blower to one Lawrence Ajodo with the aid of one Godwin (currently at large). From this moment, Lawrence Ajodo \u2013 who falsely claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and also the officer in-charge of a non-existing Asset Recovery Panel at the Federal Ministry of Justice \u2014 took over the planning and execution of the illicit operation.\n\nThrough the assistance of one Ayodele Akindipe, an herbalist, the fake CSP procured the services of an Assistant Superintendent of Police and two (2) Soldiers for the failed operation. The fake CSP also elicited the services of a journalist, one Stanley Nkwazema, and two (2) lawyers namely Bar. Alex Onyekuru and Bar. Igwe Ernest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the journalist was expected to play the blackmail role, the lawyers were expected to help the syndicate in perfecting court documents and processes. The fake CSP later deposed to an affidavit and eventually obtained a search warrant meant for the execution of the raid.\n\nInvestigations so far conducted by the Police show that the suspects criminally trespassed on the residence of Her Lordship but were not allowed to execute the search warrant due to the lawful resistance from Police officers on guard duty at her residence. Police findings also revealed that the principal suspect \u2013 Lawrence Ajodo \u2013 is an impostor and not a police officer as he falsely claimed.\n\nSimilarly, the Ghost Account for Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Tax Recovery Panel purportedly operating under the Federal Ministry of Justice does not exist at the Federal Ministry of Justice, neither is it registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Also, the signature of the Honourable Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on the ID card presented by the fake CSP during the raid was forged.

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators. They use capital to supercharge your operations and help you achieve scale. It is important to show traction you have recorded in terms of user growth and financials tracked month-on-month (MoM) or quarterly growth for startups less than a year or year-on-year for older startups.\n\nHave a data room where investors can easily access your financial records, financial forecasts, incorporation documents, product demos, team bio and pitch deck. Fundraising is often a nerve-racking period in a founder\u2019s journey but it can prove to be very definitive. Founders must be willing to go all out and give it all it takes. As the legendary Yoda said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the adoption of blockchain and the tech it creates, crypto has given rise to exciting innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\n\nEmerging economies have experienced an explosion in the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, but a new startup wants to bring more people into the fold by lowering the barrier for entry.\n\nThe brainchild of Taiwo Orilogbon and Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin is a parent company that wants to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nNestcoin wants to help Nigerians first, then other Africans, \u201cexit the status quo\u201d by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi.\n\nIt wants to do this through its media publication, Breach, and other products that use crypto technology\u2014spanning across DeFi, media, digital art and gaming.\n\n\u201cThe products we build are tools of individual freedom and creative expression,\u201d said Bademosi in a call with TechCabal.\n\nTapping into Africa\u2019s deepening crypto culture\n\nBademosi and Taiwo\u2019s ambition is rooted in their rich history in Africa\u2019s crypto space. While Taiwo is a former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian crypto exchange, Bademosi has been investing in crypto companies since 2017. He was among the earliest investors in Nigerian crypto exchange, Buycoins, which is now under a new parent company, called Helicarrier.\n\nBefore Nestcoin, Bademosi was a former director at Binance\u2019s venture capital programme. In 2019, he got seed funding from the same programme to launch a payment app in Nigeria, Bundle.\n\nAt Bundle, Bademosi said he realised the entry point is the same as the ceiling when interacting with crypto in Nigeria: trading it. So, he set out to create innovative products beyond this ceiling.\n\nBut before Binance Labs, he\u2019d begun his career in venture capital as the founding partner at Microtraction, one of the most active investors in African early-stage startups now.\n\nUsing education to drive up crypto adoption\n\nAfrica is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency among the regions, according to a survey by Chainalysis, a US-based research institute. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. This represents a 1,200% growth. Despite this, however, Africa is still the smallest crypto economy of all the regions, the institute studied. Africa received just 3% of the total value of crypto in the world.\n\nCiting data from crypto exchange, Luno, that 55% of Nigerians do not use crypto because they don\u2019t understand it, Bademosi admitted that crypto is still confusing to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to close that information gap in terms of trying to make crypto more relatable and familiar,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nAs part of efforts to drive crypto adoption using education, Nestcoin is setting up Breach to create content that explains complex crypto topics like DeFi, Blockchain, DAOs, DApps, NFTs and more to novices.\n\nBreach, officially launched today, is a platform that uses newsletters and blog posts to make easily digestible content that will help everyone make sense of the crypto world. Spearheaded by media analyst and former head of communications at Eko Atlantic City, David Adeleke, who will now be managing editor for Breach and communication lead for Nestcoin, Breach intends to make crypto mainstream and help people jumpstart their crypto careers.\n\nIncentivising the crypto community\n\nNestcoin wants to create a community of users that understands crypto, as a way to make their lives easier. Nestcoin will then harness the power of this community to create new products and embark on projects that can generate revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that we want to incentivise and reward for their participation,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nNestcoin is also creating avenues for users to make money by getting them to play games on the blockchain and invest in digital art.\n\n\u201cThe community will be able to play crypto games that have the potential of helping them earn more than in their day jobs,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As part of the deal, Meddy\u2019s CEO Haris Aghadi and COO Abed Alkarim Khattab will join Helium Health\u2019s leadership team. In addition, Meddy will now be known as Helium Doc.\n\nPartnerships between West African startups and Middle Eastern startups are rare. However, Adegoke Olubusi, Helium Health\u2019s CEO reveals that the cultural similarity of the two teams was key in the deal.\n\n\u201cBeyond the actual product and market opportunity, what made this possible was really the composition of the team, how well they executed the fact that they share a DNA and culture that\u2019s very similar to ours,\u201d he explains.\n\nFounded by Olubusi, Dimeji Sofowora, and Tito Ovia, Helium Health provides a suite of services for its healthcare clients. These services include an electronic medical records solution, HeliumPay, a billing and payment solution, a collateral-free loan product, HeliumCredit, and HeliumDoc.\n\nSince its inception, the company has established a presence in six African countries helping over 5,000 health professionals to serve about 165,000 patients monthly. This year, Helium Health has already expanded to Kenya.\n\nAt the time of its Series A raise in 2020, it hinted at plans to expand into East and North Africa.

It\u2019s called Kifta Technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKifta Technologies creates cutting-edge defence technology used by private entities and countries globally.\n\nIt makes smart glasses that can identify who you\u2019re looking at and even tell you if they\u2019re a wanted criminal.\n\nInterestingly, the company is the brainchild of a Nigerian textile merchant, Monsuru Anifowoshe.\n\nAfter several cases of stolen, intercepted and even vanished textile containers travelling from Lagos to Kano, Anifowoshe decided to build drones that\u2019ll make sure his containers arrived at their destinations safely.\n\nHardware is hard. However, Anifowoshe is making it work somehow. Kifta\u2019s first Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prototype cost $450,000 to build, easily a pre-seed raise for a software company in Nigeria.\n\nEmmanuel Paul visited Kifta Technologies HQ and dished all about the gadgets here: Nigeria\u2019s Kifta Technologies produces smart glasses, other cutting edge defence tech for companies and countries worldwide.\n\nOr you can jump straight to the video here.\n\nEquity-free financing by Lendable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to funding, there are two ways to do it. You either give up some shares in your company or get a loan and pay it back later. The former \u2014 a popular option in the startup space \u2014 is equity financing, while the latter is debt financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLendable, a UK-based debt financing company, typically gives startups between $5 million and $10 million in debt financing. However, it doesn\u2019t finance startups in the idea stage, only those with a proven product that needs to kick things up a notch.\n\nLendable shared how they invest, some of their biggest funding stories, and missed opportunities with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozirim Nwokoma.\n\nYou can read all about it here: How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups.\n\nRabbit\u2019s $11m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbit team. Sourece: TechCrunch\n\nThe grocery delivery business in Egypt seems to be getting a lot of attention lately. Last week, Breadfast and Appetito bagged $26 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s RabbitMart, aka Rabbit\u2019s turn. The startup raised a massive pre-seed round of $11 million.\n\nWho invested? Per TechCrunch, the record-breaking pre-seed saw investments from Global Founders Capital and Goodwater Capital, among others.\n\nInterestingly, Rabbit was founded in June 2021 but just came out of stealth in October.\n\nUnlike players like Breadfast and Appetito, Rabbit says it will set itself apart by letting the market call the shots. According to its CEO, Ahmad Yousry, Rabbit, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let the market dictate what we sell. We\u2019re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player.\u201d\n\nThe company employs an Amazonesque system to fulfil orders in 20 minutes. It has a large warehouse in addition to fulfilment centres to speed up delivery.\n\nThe startup plans to add more fulfilment centres in major cities across Egypt over the next year.\n\nFlutterwave acquires Disha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2021, African payments startup, Flutterwave, announced its acquisition of Disha, a platform for creators to curate their content and receive payment.\n\nDisha, which has about 20,000 users globally, was on the brink of shutting down in February 2021 but told users in a tweet that it was \u201cconsidering new options for our company and will share an update as soon as we have made a resolution.\u201d\n\nFounded by former Cregital CEO, Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019, most of the platform\u2019s users were based in the UK, US and Europe. However, it only generated a little over $1000 monthly, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean for Disha? Flutterwave will provide the platform with a new payout and collection solution to help users receive payments from audiences globally.\n\nWhile Flutterwave makes it easier for creators to receive payments, the acquisition is also a way to invest in a global creator market estimated at $104.2 billion.\n\nMFS Africa raises $100m Series C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDare Okoudjou (Founder and CEO, MFS Africa).

          "title": "INEC needs 40 times Anambra capacity for e-voting in 2023",
          "text": "With more than 80 million Nigerians registered to vote in 2023, the electoral commission will require 40 times the capacity deployed in the just concluded Anambra State governorship poll to achieve the 2023 general election.\n\nThis follows the conduct of the Anambra governorship election that had less than 2.5 million voters registered but lasted for three days as a result of hitches encountered using the Biometric Voter Authentication System (BVAS) machine.\n\nOut of the 2.5 million voters, 253,388 voters were accredited and only 249,631 votes counted. Although the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has yet to confirm the number of BVAS machines it deployed to the 5,720 polling units, it is safe to say about 5,000 machines were used in the election.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the electoral body lost some machines to attack by hoodlums days before the election. The available machines were manned by about 26,000 ad hoc staff.\n\nMultiple voters including the gubernatorial candidates monitored by BusinessDay experienced difficulties with the BVAS. Some of the challenges include facial recognition, authenticating voters\u2019 fingerprints, which made the entire process slow and cumbersome. On average, completing the voting process took about 20 minutes per person.\n\nPaddy Ezeala, a public affairs analyst, told BusinessDay that Anambra was a testing ground for the INEC machines in preparation for the 2023 elections. The electoral body would need to take lessons from the hitches as it prepares for the upcoming presidential elections in less than 16 months.\n\nRead Also: INEC relies on facial verification of voters as fingerprint fails\n\n\u201cI cannot condemn the application of technology because it is the way forward, so we have more than a whole year to apply both the resources needed, upgrade the technology and train the personnel working with the BVAS machine to make the e-voting more effective in the 2023 general election,\u201d Ezeala said.\n\nAbong Matthew, the presiding officer at polling unit 005 Ward 11, Otuocha1, Wri Primary School 2 Anambra, said voting started at 8:30 am on Saturday and most of the 756 total registered voters at the center experienced some form of challenge, sometimes due to the malfunction of the BVAS machine.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS machine has been a major issue for us here, the machine cannot authorize fingerprints and facial recognition,\u201d Matthew said.\n\nThe biometric voter accreditation system (BVAS) is a device that replaces the Smart Card Reader (SCR), which was used in 2015.\n\nThe BVAS has the dual capacity for fingerprint and facial authentication of voters. It was first deployed in the Isoko South I State Constituency Bye-election in Delta State on September 11, 2021. Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the INEC, declared the pilot as successful.\n\nThe goal of the BVAS, according to the INEC boss, is to guard against identity theft where one person uses another person\u2019s Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to vote using the incident form.\n\n\u201cWith this development, the use of the incident form is abolished. No voter without genuine PVC will vote. No voter who has not been successfully accredited electronically using the BVAS will vote,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother feature of the BVAS is a camera that enables it to capture Polling Unit level results and upload them to the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal so that citizens can view results as the election is concluded in each Polling Unit. This eliminates the need for the Z-Pad since its functions have been embedded in the BVAS.\n\nHowever, the BVAS deployment did not really live up to many people\u2019s expectations. Charles Chukwuma Soludo, the governor-elect in the Anambra election, expressed concerns after his experience voting with the BVAS machine. In his case, it took nearly 40 minutes to conclude the voting process.\n\nVincent Ozigbo, the candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), had his thumbprint rejected several times by the BVAS before he cast his vote at his polling unit. The Anambra election had to be completed in three days due to the hitches reported from different voting centers.\n\nEzeala wondered that \u201cif it takes three days to conduct the Anambra election, which is just one state using the BVAS, then there is a need to upgrade broadband infrastructure and train personnel to enable effective use when it will cover the 36 states in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is just one state out of the states, if for instance, those malfunctioning happens in the 36 states, it will spoil the whole process. So, let them do the needful and look at the technology again, upgrade the technology where necessary, and train the personnel to work.\u201d\n\nOmorodion Odion, a public relations officer, said the challenges experienced in Anambra could have been mitigated if the INEC personnel were well trained on how to use the technology.\n\n\u201cIf we get enough human resource training on this device and more personnel to work, we will have a more transparent and effective election in 2023,\u201d Odion said.",

          "title": "Decarbonising shipping creates $1trn opportunity for developing nations",
          "text": "The World Bank has said that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions through the use of low carbon power sources in international shipping would create $1trillion opportunities for developing nations, even those who are not oil producers.\n\nBinyam Reger, acting global director for transport and manager of transport global practice for the World Bank, in a presentation at the UN COP 26 summit in Glasgow on Wednesday, shared a World Bank study that purported to show massive opportunities for developing countries.\n\nAccording to the World Bank expert, the move towards decarbonization could allow the participation of countries without the traditional oil used in shipping through the production of hydrogen and ammonia for domestic use and for exports.\n\nReger said about 208 countries could potentially benefit from this shift. The production of blue ammonia is currently dominated by a few countries with little potential for developing countries.\n\nIn the developing world, several firms are developing green ammonia, a route to ammonia in which hydrogen derived from water electrolysis powered by alternative energy replaces hydrocarbon-based hydrogen, making ammonia production virtually carbon dioxide-free, says industry publication.\n\nThese companies are investing in carbon capture and storage to minimize the carbon impact of making conventional ammonia, creating what the industry refers to as blue ammonia.\n\nRead Also: China\u2019s crackdown on cryptocurrency miners reduces carbon emissions\n\nThe aim is to capture, store and ship hydrogen for use in emission-free fuel cells and turbines. Some also seek to combust ammonia directly in power plants and ship engines.\n\nHowever, these require millions of dollars, financial investment unavailable to many developing countries. Reger said green ammonia offers developing countries a path in getting onto the game.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s quite a lot of potential in many countries that can be part of this party chain for transitioning the shipping industry into green ammonia or greener, or zero-carbon bunker fuels,\u201d he said.\n\nReger contends that zero-carbon fuel production can create investment and export opportunities.\n\nCountries can further benefit by becoming refueling hubs on the green shipping line at the same time, they produce the zero-carbon fuel that would be used for export.\n\nFor countries, some estimates put in about a trillion dollars, maybe even more to really see the transition into a zero-carbon bunker fuel system.\n\nSo from our point of view, from where we stand at the World Bank as a development institution, this really could be a game-changer in terms of not only making the shipping industry greener but also providing the countries an opportunity for a new industrial and job creation industry.\n\nWhy a shift is needed\n\nCarbon emission from the shipping industry, which accounts for 3 percent of the total CO2 emissions, has been at an upward rise due to rising global trade.\n\n\u201cTrade increase is a good thing for reducing poverty and increasing prosperity of countries but it means the shipping industry contributes a great deal to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change,\u201d said Reger.\n\nNineteen countries including Britain and the United States on Wednesday agreed to create zero-emissions shipping trade routes between ports to speed up the decarbonization of the global maritime industry.\n\nClimate action requires a rapid shift from today\u2019s predominant use of fossil fuels to zero-carbon alternatives.\n\nJohannah Christensen, the CEO, Global Maritime Forum, said emerging economies and developing countries will play a critical role, not only in shipping decarbonization in the wider energy transition but in reaching global emissions targets.\n\n\u201cMany developing and emerging economies have renewable energy potential and are located close to key shipping lanes, putting them in a position to produce and export their emissions, green fuels derived from renewable energy,\u201d said Christensen.",

          "text": "Some Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) are setting up street kiosks as part of their marketing strategy to boost sales and improve customer service.\n\nAccording to a BusinessDay survey, restaurants in Lagos \u2013 Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub such as Mr Biggs, Chicken Republic, and Sweet Sensation \u2013 pioneers of the QSR industry have been using the Sell-on-the-Go marketing strategy and setting up express kiosks since 2019.\n\nThese kiosks \u2013 small, stand-alone booth-like structures placed in areas with high foot traffic \u2013 are used by businesses to reach their customers informally. It is a type of direct, low-cost marketing strategy.\n\nUchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at the Lagos Business School said many Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) are packaging their products into smaller bits to make it easier for hawking and restaurants are late in the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power of Selling-on-the-Go makes you more accessible to the end consumer, it helps you to break down what you are offering in smaller sizes that people can afford,\u201d said Uzo.\n\nUzo added that QSRs give immediate market information on the products people buy frequently, the size, package, and quantity they want, noting that it also helps in price testing like what proportion, menu, the right price point that people are willing to pay for among others as well as brand visibility.\n\nSimilarly, Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital Plc said QSRs are going retail as much as possible to offer more products and services.\n\n\u201cThere is also the need to go beyond the mega outlets because it is expensive and difficult to run. It is cheaper to run small kiosks,\u201d Akinloye said.\n\nTwo recession witnessed in the last five years has led to high inflationary pressures, low purchasing power, and falling incomes of consumers. Apart from QSRs going into smaller formats, FMCGs now package their products into smaller sachets to target the larger segment of the economy.\n\nSome of the advantages of using kiosks are that it improves customer buying experience, increases customer base, reduces cost of the business, and increases efficiency among others.\n\nRead also: UAC Restaurants increases retail offering to consumers, opens bakery in Lagos\n\n\u201cA lot of Consume Food Service operators are now trying to explore format minitralization. It is a tread of trying to increase transaction numbers and reduce cost,\u201d Cheng Fuller, a retail expert said.\n\nFuller advised that if restaurants want to penetrate neighbourhoods and reach more consumers for profitability\u2019s sake, they should try to increase their outlets but only in smaller formats because the larger ones are expensive.\n\nIn other countries like the US, UK and France, kiosks are well established there but it is the self-ordering ones that they use. With the help of technology, this type of kiosk allows customers to select and pay for products and services without the need for human interaction.\n\nBut the kiosks in Nigeria do not use technology. What consumers do is walk into the kiosk, look at the menu/price list and place their orders.\n\n\u201cOne way to meet customers is to give them the go-to service that meets their needs. So, the more you increase your point of sales, the more sales you make,\u201d Wale Abioye, a manager at Sweet Sensation said.\n\nHe further said, \u201cIf you look at the demography of those who are patronizing these small kiosks, they are within the age group of 16- 30 something years. So, all brands have to go that direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Association of Fast Food and Confectioners of Nigerian (AFFCON), the Nigerian food industry is estimated to be worth over one trillion Naira and is also one of the best-performing industries in the country.\n\nA recent report by Euromonitor International, a London-based market research company, predicts that 2021 might likely see some street stalls/kiosks strive to improve their customer service by offering more attractive outlets to better compete with limited-service restaurants.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, some restaurant chains are launching their street stalls/kiosks as they seek new sources of revenue. Mr Bigg\u2019s is particularly notable in this regard, as its Mr Bigg\u2019s Express kiosks use a similar bold red and yellow frontage as its limited-service restaurants,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAlthough it is an interesting opportunity, Uzo advises that QSRs should not copy each other or else their business could shut down.\n\nFuller also said the restaurants should not copy each other blindly. \u201cThey should do it based on their unique financial constraints and benefits that would accrue to them.\u201d",

The project will also improve staff capacities especially in the area of public sector engagement and advocacy.\n\nProject PAWED kicked off with an advocacy visit to the Edo State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The team which consists of LAPO and DRPC representatives was led by the Executive Director, LAPO, Dr. Honestus Ayobami Obadiora.\n\nGiven the project, the Executive Director, LAPO, recognized that Agriculture has an important role to play in sustainable Economic Empowerment of women. He noted that women are still being marginalized due to cultural restrictions or gender-based deprivations at the grass-root level.\n\nHe, therefore, solicited for improved access of women to farm inputs and credits, deliberate efforts by the Government to involve more women in production and educate women farmers on effective methods of agricultural processing, preservation, and storage. He also solicited more government support in the area of budgetary provision for agricultural infrastructure, farm settlement schemes, and increased financing for women farmers to enhance agricultural productivity and women\u2019s economic empowerment.\n\nResponding, the Permanent Secretary, Peter Aikhuomobhogbe confirmed that the state government and ministry are currently implementing several women-friendly policies and programmes including a minimum of 40% women inclusion in government interventions and appointments. He however promised to include more gender-inclusive projects in the budget when and where necessary.\n\nIn addition, the Director of Agricultural Services, Erhunmwonsere Sunday noted that women are being used as tools for resistance even to gender-inclusive programmes and policy implementations and that there is a need to interface with the cultural interference to ensure maximum reception of gender-inclusive projects. He called on LAPO for intensive community level advocacy and sensitizations to reduce these hindrances.\n\n...",

The goal of encouraging the role of girls and women in STEM fields has been the cornerstone of the technology-learning programs supported by the U.S. Mission in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of the project in Osogbo, U.S. Consul General Claire Pierangelo noted that the six months capacity building program will foster a supportive community where the young girls can receive mentorship, network and share internship opportunities in STEM fields.\n\nPierangelo explained that the \u201cOsun Girls Can Code\u201d program is one of the many initiatives of the U.S. Mission that seeks to ensure gender parity, and provide women and girls with opportunities to contribute to creating sustainable and inclusive economic prosperity for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe United States promotes the rights and empowerment of women and girls in our foreign policy, and we have invested millions of dollars to advance gender equality across sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d Pierangelo said.\n\n\u201cWhen barriers to the participation of women and girls in STEM fields are removed, we all benefit. Whether at home or abroad, promoting women in the STEM fields is a U.S. government priority.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the capacity building program for the 300 high school girls, 60 female STEM teachers from Osun State will receive training to help teach more effectively and on how to mentor women and girls about careers in tech fields.\n\nThe project will end with a pitch competition to showcase the participants\u2019 achievements, with U.S. Consulate representatives taking part on the panel and the winning schools receiving prizes. A 2016 Mandela Washington Fellow, Dayo Adeniyi, is implementing the project with a public diplomacy grant from the U.S. Consulate General.\n\nThe U.S. government has introduced a number of programs to create opportunities for women in the tech field. In 2011, the U.S. government introduced the TechWomen program to empower the next generation of women leaders in the technology field. This exchange program brings together women in Northern California with their counterparts in the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria for a professional mentorship at leading technology companies in the U.S.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Oyo State governor, Engr. \u2019Seyi Makinde, on Thursday, said that Ibadan Inland Dry Port is a project that is after the heart of his administration, adding that the government would do all that is necessary to ensure every bottleneck around the project is resolved.\n\nThe governor, while receiving the staff of the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council, led by its Executive Secretary, Hon. Emmanuel Jime, at the Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, stated that he would love to see the dry port start operation almost immediately.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted him as saying that his administration is eager to partner with the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council and to do everything possible to achieve an early realisation of the project.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis visit is coming at a very right time. I think I can see a few faces we have met before on this. The Ibadan Inland Dry Port is a project that is after our heart in this administration.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in, we thought it was something that as we were opening the rail line, a few months after, we would be pushing the envelope as far as economic activities around the port area is concerned, but here we are.\n\n\u201cI listened to the Executive Secretary on the workplan, he stopped at financial closure by May next year. We want to know when this project will be a reality. When are we going to lift the first cargo from that dry port.\n\n\u201cYes, I have been talking to the Hon. Minister of Transportation, and yes, the stakeholders\u2019 engagement you talked about is important and it is sanctioned. We don\u2019t have anything to hide in this administration.\n\n\u201cIf we have things that should have been done on our side that are having a negative impact on the progress of this project, please let us know. We will remove those impediments almost immediately.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf there are things that we also need to do to fast-track this project, we really want to do it; because this project is a game-changer for us. We have written to the Federal Government to give us the road from Ojoo to the Moniya Interchange. People are waiting to invest in the construction of that road.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to recreate Apapa here and the only way we can have the maximum benefit from that project is for us to put all the safeguards in place such that the headache from Apapa is not just transferred to this place.\n\n\u201cWe want to be your partner and do everything for early realisation of this project. And it should not be so difficult, because I am accessible and you can reach out to me directly.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council, Hon. Jime, appreciated Governor Makinde\u2019s commitment towards the realisation of the Ibadan Inland Dry Port project.\n\nHe noted that the South-West geopolitical zone has always been strategic towards the implementation of the Council\u2019s mandate due to the presence of the Apapa and Tin Can Island ports and other industrial activities in the zone.\n\nJime explained that the Ibadan Inland Dry Port is an 80,000 modular Dry Port to be developed by CRCC Construction Company with an investment outlay of USD 94.00 Million.\n\nHe said that it is located at Olorisa-Oko in Moniya and that the 875 Kilometre Lagos-Kano Standard Gauge railway is on its planned alignment.\n\nHe maintained that the Oyo State government has released the grant of the 90 Hectares of land free from all encumbrances for the project and has also committed to the development of an industrial park, access road among other facilities.",

Among them was that of a man who was picked for attempting to extort Salem\u2019s family.\n\nMeanwhile, Salem\u2019s Facebook page has been flooded with melancholic tributes by his colleagues and friends.\n\nHis sister Elizabeth Jessica expressed anger that the authorities let Salem down.\n\n\u201cTordue Salem the country you loved so much and believed in refused to investigate your missing until the enemy killed you\u201d, she wrote.\n\nSteve Pine condoled with her, writing: \u201cIt is very unfortunate!

There were numerous cases where votes announced by INEC exceeded the number of accredited voters in polling units.\n\n\u201cAnother clear manifestation of collusion between the Obiano Administration and INEC was the publishing of results on the Social Media handles of APGA even before official announcement by INEC. Yet mysteriously, the votes announced in advance by APGA always corresponded correctly with the official figures released by INEC.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that our candidate, who polled over 200,000 votes in the APC primary election would be allocated slightly above 43,000 votes by INEC.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising that APGA that lost almost 80 per cent of its stalwarts through defection to the APC before the election came out \u2018victorious\u2019.

          "title": "Nigeria Correctional Centres: 15 jailbreaks occur in 8 years, 3,646 inmates still on the run",
          "text": "Close to 4,000 inmates that escaped from Nigerian correctional centres between 2013 and this year are yet to be rearrested, our investigations have revealed.\n\nOf the 3,646 inmates yet to be recaptured in the last three years, about half of the fleeing criminals were illegally set free in three major jailbreaks this year(2021) alone.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that a total of 6,407 inmates in 15 correctional centres across the country regained unauthorised freedom following breach of security by unknown gunmen, including some suspected members of Boko Haram and armed robbers.\n\nHowever, the minister put the figure of those inmates still on the run at 3,412.\n\nMode of attacks\n\nThe miscreants usually attack the centres with sophisticated weapons, including machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices as evident in the Owerri and Benin City attacks where they assaulted poorly armed security personnel and freed large numbers of inmates serving various terms at the custodial centres.\n\nBlueprint also observed that hoodlums had taken advantage of the #ENDSARS protest to launch severe attacks on some dismally manned correctional centres such as the Benin City and Owerri facilities where sundry mass assault weapons were freely deployed to set free inmates and subsequently looted stores of provisions and few weapons available.\n\nThese breakages also culminated in the death of 30 persons including inmates and correctional officials while no fewer than 200 others were either severely injured or sustained minor injuries which nonetheless were serious enough to require weeks of medical attention.\n\nTimelines of jailbreaks\n\nAvailable records revealed the jailbreaks at different times across the country.\n\nFor instance, at the Shagamu minimum correctional centre, Ogun state, attacked January 4, 2013 by hoodlums, resulted in the escape of 20 inmates and left several officials and others injured.\n\nOnly about four escapees were said to have been rearrested by the armed squad of the Service.\n\nSecurity at the Olokuta Medium Security Centre in Akure, Ondo state was severely breached on the 30th of June 2013.\n\nNo fewer than 175 inmates escaped while two persons died and one warder was severely injured. A paltry 54 escapees were rearrested.\n\nIt was the turn of the Kirikiri Medium Prison Correctional Centre, Lagos state on 10th of October, 2014.\n\nThough it was largely unsuccessful, nonetheless, 20 inmates lost their lives while 80 others were injured and 12 escaped from the facility.\n\nSimilarly, on the 2nd of November, 2014, the Koto-Karfe Correctional Centre in Kogi state, came under assault allegedly by Boko Haram elements.\n\nConsequently, 144 inmates broke free while one inmate was killed. Only 45 of the fleeing inmates were rearrested.\n\nSecurity at the Ado Ekiti Correctional Centre, Ekiti state was breached on the 30th of November 2014, during which an official of the centre was killed, while 341 prisoners escaped from the facility. Officials said about 77 inmates were recaptured.\n\nThen came the Minna, Niger state incident in December 2014, when three unknown gunmen attacked and freed 270 inmates. A security officer was severely injured.\n\nTwice in 2016, the Kuje Medium Security Centre, FCT Abuja was assaulted. In fact, the first instance led to the Kuje centre chief being relieved of his duty by the Controller General of the Nigerian Correctional Centre Service (NCoS).\n\nThirteen inmates had on July 29, 2016 escaped during a jailbreak at the Koton-Karfe Correctional Centre in Kogi state. The centre seems to have a notoriety for jailbreaks as it has had three incidents, two of which were this year alone.\n\nThe Nsukka Correctional Centre in Enugu state took its turn on the 9th of August, 2016, when inmates organised themselves and broke out of their cells and 15 successfully disappeared into thin air.\n\nAgain, on June 3, 2018, the Medium Security Correctional Centre in the Tunga area of Minna, Niger state joined the train as more than 200 inmates gained illegal freedom and only 28 were rearrested.\n\nLike Lagos and Kuje centres, the Edo centre has experienced jailbreaks and repeated attempts to effect forced freedom for inmates.\n\nFirst, on the 19th of October, 2020, under the disguise of ENDSARs protesters, miscreants took advantage to launch a damaging attack on the Benin City and Oko centres illegally setting free 1,993 inmates, the highest of such numbers in history in Nigeria.\n\nSubsequently, two other attempts were made to secure unauthorised freedom for inmates, but they ended futile.\n\nOn 5 April 2021, Owerri centre, Imo state was forcefully thrown open allegedly by members of the Eastern Security Network (ESW) who succeeded in setting free 1,844 inmates, and burnt down other police facilities within the vicinity of the prison. Authorities said the attack experienced the most aggressive use of machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices, among others in the history jailbreak encounter.\n\nOn the 14th of September this year, the facility in Kabba, Kogi state, came under attack and many inmates got out, though 144 were recaptured.\n\nThis was climaxed on the 22nd of October when 1000 inmates at the Abolongo Correctional Centre in Ibadan broke loose and escaped from the facility.\n\nFG speaks\n\nSpeaking on the issue and related ones at a media parley in Abuja Thursday, Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola assured the escapees would be rearrested.\n\nHe said out of the 4,369 inmates that have escaped from correctional centres due to attacks on the facilities, only 984 were recaptured.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing organised by the Presidential Media Team at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, the minister said 3,906 inmates were still on the run.\n\nThe minister said it would be difficult for the inmates that escaped to run away from the long arm of the law, stressing that the biometrics of all inmates in the country had been captured.\n\n\u201cHow long can they continue to run from the state? The state is a patient bird. You can run but you can never hide. We have their biometrics. Whenever and wherever they appear to transact any business, their cover will be blown.\n\n\u201cI will like to inform Nigerians that we have captured the biometric information of all inmates in the facilities of NCoS working in partnership with the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC).\n\n\u201cTherefore, we have the capacity and are tracking all escapees from our facilities. In addition, we are working with and have shared the details of escapees with INTERPOL to check the risks of cross border movements,\u201d he said.\n\nOn reformation and rehabilitation of the inmates, the minister said there were 465 inmates running different degree programmes at the National Open University of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are various ongoing reformation and education programmes for inmates in our custodial facilities. The Service, in partnership with the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), has increased the number of Study Centres to 10 across Correctional formations (Abeokuta, Anambra, Enugu, Kaduna, Keffi, Kuje, Lafia, Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Umuahia).\n\n\u201cThere are currently about 465 inmates running various Degree programmes, 85 of the inmates are running Post \u2013 Graduate Degree programs, while four are running PhD programmes within the custodial facilities.\n\n\u201cA total of 560 inmates have been enrolled for WAEC/NECO Examinations and 2,300 for Adult Literacy Classes in several Custodial Centers. Additional Borstal Training Institutions for young offenders, male and female, are to be established in each State of the Federation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister assured Nigerians that a ministerial task force would soon be inaugurated to enforce the re-arrest of all escapees and their collaborators.\n\nWhy jailbreaks?\n\nAccording to official data, Nigerian correctional centres across the country currently contain as many as 70,000 inmates, with only about 20,000 or 27% of them convicted.\n\nIn 2019, the interior minister said: \u201cClose to 90 per cent of the awaiting trial inmates are violators of state laws and so are essentially the responsibility of the various state governments.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to carry them along in devising strategies to decongest the facilities. In six months, this will be put behind us.\u201d\n\nIn other words, congestion of the facilities is largely caused by states who have failed to expedite action to pre-trial and other cases.\n\nHow it usually happens\n\nOn how the jailbreaks happen, NCoS spokesperson, Francis Enobore said: \u201cThe attacks usually occurred where we have a large number of awaiting trial persons. In the Owerri attack, where we have over 1,800 inmates, 1,693 inmates are awaiting trial.\n\n\u201cIn the Kabba incident, we have 294 persons in custody out of which 224 are awaiting trial. The push to get agitated and look for alternative means of leaving the facilities is higher where we have more awaiting trial inmates.\u201d\n\nParents, traditional rulers returning escaped inmates\n\nHowever, the NCoS said parents and some traditional rulers have voluntarily returned their wards who escaped following attacks on the facilities, to the various custodial centres.\n\nAlthough Mr Enobore was not forthcoming with the official figures of escaped inmates yet to be rearrested and returned to custody Thursday, he assured that the agency has a proper record of the escapees from the recent attacks.\n\n\u201cWe have all their records intact. We have been able to advance the course of modern record keeping of our inmates. We have their photographs and biometrics. That was the reason pictures of inmates that illegally broke free from the Abolongo centre were publicised to alert the public.\n\n\u201cAlso, we initiated a nationwide campaign urging the escapees to voluntarily return to their terms, and equally appealed to their close associates against compromise or colluding with the fleeing inmates by hiding them from the law.\n\n\u201cWe did mention that since we have their biometrics, we are going to hunt each and every one of them to the last man standing. And as a matter of fact, if you are found to have provided safe haven for any escapee, of course, you have contravened the law of the country and would accordingly be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe campaign has been successful. Parents have been returning their wards, traditional rulers, counsels; friends equally have been complying and assisting to return escapees.\u201d\n\n\u2018FG building more facilities\u2019\n\nOn ways out, the NCoS said six ultra-modern special custodial centres that would exclusively be used to house high-profile criminals were under construction across the six geo-political zones.\n\nThe special centres would include court premises, anti-aggression security posts with sophisticated security equipment and many more.\n\nThe agency spokesman said when completed and put to use, these facilities would prevent the incessant assault on the correctional centres experienced in recent times. \u201cThe ultra-modern capacity facilities of three thousand capacity in each of the six geo-political zones across the country is built to accommodate issues surrounding high profile criminals and how to keep them safe.\n\n\u201cHow do you protect the facilities from aggression? How do you take them to court for those awaiting trial? In fact, the question of taking them to court doesn\u2019t even arise because as it is structured, we are expected to have court premises within the complex to reduce the drudgery and the risk involved in some of these exercises for which you are aware. Sometimes, we suffer attacks on the way and our men are killed by some of these criminals who forcefully released their members,\u201d he further added.\n\nBesides, the agency said other custodial centres were being upgraded and equipped in terms of capacity and humane environment for the inmates.\n\nCases of invalid investigation\n\nCommenting on the development, a former Commissioner of Police and now special adviser to the Oyo state governor on security, Mr Fatai Owoseni, said: \u201cJailbreak is a well-coordinated and organised crime which does not happen randomly but requires a lot of efforts and combined forces and of course aided by insider information from the inmates and perhaps some criminal elements within as well.\n\n\u201cPrevious investigations into the causes of jailbreaks have yielded no results. Sadly, most of the time, officials tended to be on the defensive and would rather not come clear with reports that would implicate officials of correctional centres.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Owoseni\u2019s position, another security expert and former director, Department of State Services, Mr Mike Ejiofor, said: \u201cThe Service does not have the means to strengthen access control. And because these facilities are vulnerable, criminals explore their vulnerability. There must be a major upgrade of our correctional facilities. The facilities are overcrowded.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to review the judicial process by speeding up trials or releasing those who have no case to answer on bail. The Service does not even have enough manpower and the officials are not well armed to curtail the attacks.\u201d\n\nAlso, a guidance and counselling expert, Mrs Faith Okosun, advised the government to make \u201cweekly character reordering and purposeful skill acquisition mandatory to all inmates, stressing that it would give every inmate purpose and the drive to hope for meaningful life after serving their term.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria Police Thursday paraded 14 suspects involved in the invasion of the Abuja residence of a Supreme Court Justice, Mary Odili.\n\nThe suspects include the whistle blower, prayer warrior and herbalist, Ali Umar Ibrahim; the mastermind-one CSP Lawrence Ajojo-a fake police officer; a contributing editor with THISDAY Newspaper, Stanley Nkwazema; lawyers and banker among others.\n\nBut the management of THISDAY has disowned Nkwazema, saying he resigned from his job as a sports correspondent some 15 years ago.\n\nParading the suspects at the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) Headquarters, Area 10, Abuja, Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), CP Frank Mba, said seven of the suspects, including two soldiers, were still at large.\n\nHe said the suspects, who came from different professional backgrounds, were members of a criminal syndicate that specialises in operating as law enforcement officers.\n\nMba noted that the criminals were loose cannons and document forgers who were on their own and not hired by any personnel of the Ministry of Justice as they claimed.\n\nCP Mba further said the suspects conspired to raid the residence following information that the Supreme Court Justice was keeping a large sum of money in foreign currencies.\n\nHe commended the resistance by the security personnel deployed to the Odili residence for not allowing the suspects access to the premises, stating that it would have been a great embarrassment to the nation before the international community if the operation had succeeded.\n\nFielding questions from journalists, Ajodo, who was found to be with a police identity card with the rank of CPS in his name as well as an identity card of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) also in his name and signed by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), confessed that he was not a policeman and does not work with the EFCC.\n\nHe also confessed to have forged the signature of the Attorney General, adding that he was not deployed on the mission to raid Odili\u2019s residence by Malami.\n\n\u201cI work for Malami as a consultant of recoveries, there are five of us. I was given 18 accounts to recover, though Malami did not send me to this mission. I am a banking expert with specialty in finance and forensic.\u201d\n\nAjodo also claimed that there was a mix-up during the raid, stating that the search warrant was supposed to be for No 9 but it read No 7.\n\nHe said they quickly revoked the warrant as soon as they noticed the mix-up.\n\nHowever, the whistleblower, Ibrahim, who claimed he was contacted by Odili\u2019s Godson, said he had some prayer sessions in the residence which revealed there was money in the JSC\u2019s house, and even swore to an affidavit to that effect at the EFCC office.\n\nHe claimed that Ajodo diverted his affidavit to the Ministry of Justice and he had led the team on a surveillance to Odili\u2019s residence before the raid.\n\n\u201cI am the whistle blower and I swore to an affidavit that there was millions of money stashed in that house. I was introduced as an Islamic prayer warrior to the Godson of Justice Odili and I did prayer there on October 13. I prayed to know if the story that there was money in the house was true.\n\n\u201cSo after the prayers, I decided to go through the EFCC as a formal channel and I was interviewed and interrogated. However, I ended up in the Ministry of Justice because Ajodo told me it was the same thing that EFCC is under Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cHe asked to go for surveillance before the raid. I took him to the address and directed them to Justice Odili\u2019s house,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the journalist claimed he was following a lead on recovery of asset brought to him by one of the suspects, Barrister Alex Onyekwere.\n\nAccording to Nkwazema, who claimed he was a contributing editor with THISDAY Newspapers, he followed the lead for three days before the raid.\n\nHe admitted joining the team for the raid but claimed he did not enter the premises.\n\nAsked why he did not speak up or file a report based on his findings despite the outcry that followed the raid, especially after the security agencies denied involvement but waited five days before responding to invitation by the FCID, the journalist said he was at the FCID on his own volition.\n\nNkwazema not one of us \u2013 THISDAY\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY Newspapers has disowned Nkwazema, saying he pulled out of the company some 15 years ago.\n\nThe position was contained in a disclaimer issued the company\u2019s Managing Editor (print and digital), Bolaji Adebiyi in Abuja Thursday.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe attention of the management of THISDAY NEWSPAPERS has been drawn to the news making the rounds that Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, one of those suspected to have invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili claimed to be a staff and Contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claim, Mr. Nkwazema is neither a Staff of THISDAY nor a Contributing Editor. He was a Sports Correspondent and resigned more than 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cHowever, occasionally, he, like hundreds of other readers of the newspaper, sends for publication articles and analyses and is usually obliged, a privilege THISDAY gives to some of its ex-staff. That does not in any way make him a staff and contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cSince his resignation, THISDAY had at no time contracted Mr. Nkwazema to investigate any story, and we know nothing of his alleged investigation of a story leading to the raid of the residence of Hon. Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe police authorities and the general public should, therefore, note that Mr. Nkwazema, whatever may be his involvement in this matter, was not acting on behalf of THISDAY in any shape or form.\u201d",

          "text": "BAYO AGBOOLA writes that uncertainty still surrounds the outcome of the Oyo APC state congress with stakeholders divided on whether it should stand or not\n\nStakeholders battle from Abuja to Ibadan\n\nThe past few days, particularly, after the Oyo state congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on October 30th, at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan in Oyo state, have not been the best of times for the party as stakeholders and gladiators are deeply engaged in supremacy war over whether the outcome of state congress should stay or not.\n\nThe battle has vacillated from Ibadan to Abuja and Abuja back to Ibadan with the APC national secretariat having meetings after meetings with the concerned stakeholders.\n\nLast Wednesday, the parties in the crisis were mandated in Abuja to go back home and sort things out themselves within a week.\n\nAbuja peace moves\n\nAccording to the caretaker committee chairman of Oyo APC, Chief Akin Oke, \u201cthe meetings reviewed the list of nominees for the state executive committee offices according to the zoning principles to the seven administrative units of the state.\n\nOke further disclosed, \u201cWe were directed to verify nominations by the zonal leaders that submitted the list. This is to be done with former governor of Oyo state, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, the two former deputy governors, Chief Iyiola Oladokun and Otunba Moses Alake Adeyemo, the seven zonal leaders and myself.\n\nAccording to the directive, \u201cthe approved list is to be submitted to the national secretariat of the party through me within a week\u201d.\n\nChairman state congress committee insists on results\n\n\u201cWhile the Chairman of the APC state congress committee, Hon Gambo Lawan on his part insisted that the outcome of the congress but only for harmonisation as it \u201cis now a matter of give and take, where harmonisation will take place.\u201d\n\nHe said the meeting was just for reconciliation or harmonisation, nothing like fresh congress, saying that APC is one big family and will continue to be.\n\n\u201cWhat was discussed is how all the groups, leaders and other stakeholders, would work together to depose the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.\u201d\n\nBuni\u2019s intervention\n\nOke further noted, \u201cThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee Chairman, Governor Mai Buni, only called this meeting to iron out all the issues. Nothing like new congress. The Saturday 30th congress stays, it was monitored by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other relevant agencies. This is family affairs and the process of amicable resolution has commenced\u201d.\n\nHow agitations started\n\nHowever, as the Saturday October 30 congress was going on, some of the party gladiators under the auspices of Oyo APC stakeholders including Chief Adebayo Adelabu; Prof Adeolu Akande, Mogaji Tegbe, Dr Abdul Azeez Adeduntan, Hon Tolu Akande-Sadipe; Minister for Sports, Sunday Dare; Mogaji Joseph Tegbe, former ALGON Chair, Abass Aleshinloye, among others, stormed Premier Hotel in Ibadan to make public their grievances and decision not to be part in the congress.\n\nThrough the spokesperson, Senator Ayo Adeseun, they had demanded for the immediate suspension of the congress as a result of what they called alleged \u201cforgery of wards and delegates lists\u201d by some elements in the party \u201cfor their selfish reasons\u201d.\n\nThey also claimed that the delegates lists was allegedly manipulated despite what was sent to Abuja by the state APC executives after the legitimate ward and local government congresses held in Oyo state.\n\nAccording to Senator Adeseun, the list sent from Abuja for the state congress was in complete variance from what was sent from the state and that \u201cthere is a limit to what the party membership could condone.\n\n\u201cWe received information that the list sent in from Abuja had been allegedly tampered with by a both serving senator and a former governor of the state (names withheld).\n\n\u201cIn order to safeguard the integrity of the process, we appeal to our National Chairman to suspend the state congress until all of this is sorted out. We appeal to our National Excos to suspend this process. Oyo is a sensitive state.\n\n\u201cThe national congress could be attended by the statutory list of delegates from the state. Oyo APC is ready to take over only if we are sincere with our hard earned democracy. The so-called state congress has been postponed. We have committed too much to the party, for anyone to make a fool of us.\n\n\u201cWe were all prepared for the state congress until yesterday (Friday) morning when the panel from Abuja came. We have been clamouring for the list of delegates. Some of us went to Abuja to say we couldn\u2019t have a congress when we didn\u2019t have delegate list.\n\n\u201cThey promised they would do something about it and the list now came yesterday (Friday) and when we opened it, we saw it was just \u2018contraband\u2019. We are very confident that top leadership of the party are probably not aware of what some people did around their offices. When we put this out and let the world see, we are confident that they would correct the anomalies.\n\nAllegation of falsified delegates\u2019 list\n\n\u201cSome dubious people have inserted fake delegates into the list brought from Abuja. Normally, when you write an examination, you need to get results to know if you pass or fail. We did the first congress, we did not get its result. We held the second one, with no result. They kept them all. They brought them all together to us yesterday (Friday) for us to hold the state congress.\n\n\u201cThe delegates list brought on Friday was fake and falsified; false names were observed on the list. It is not possible to use the falsified list for the state congress. In this state congress, we have agreed to go for consensus, but some elements in the party falsified the delegates list.\u201d\n\nSenator Adeseun added, \u201d if they use the falsified delegates\u2019 list to hijack the party structure, can they use the same approach to win in the general elections? Two people are behind this falsified, adulterated, and fake delegates\u2019 list. One serving senator and a former governor of the state. Party members and leaders in Oyo state are vehemently kicking against using such delegates\u2019 list to conduct the state congress.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to appeal to the national leadership of our party to intervene. The suffering in Oyo state is too much. We don\u2019t want to suffer again. The only solution to this is to allow our party to conduct the election and win. Our party was in government for eight years and brought unprecedented development to the state.\n\nHow similar crisis ceded victory to PDP\n\n\u201cIn 2018, there was a crisis in our party, and it was polarised, that polarisation led to the victory of the ruling party in Oyo State. We now came together and decided to elect our party officers transparently, but the former governor and the serving senator don\u2019t want it that way.It is not possible to hold today\u2019s congress if we don\u2019t get the legitimate and authentic list, that is transparently compiled,\u201d he said.\n\nHow protester moved to stop congress\n\nAmidst the drama over whether the state congress would hold or not , some elements suspected to be hoodlums reportedly stormed the hotel where the chairman of the state congress committee lodged, blocked the entrances to prevent him from heading to the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium venue of the congress to prevent him from overseeing the congress.\n\nThe congres committee chairman himself attributed the siege on his hotel to the antics of the \u2018miscreants and hoodlums\u2019 that besieged the hotel shooting sporadically into the air and that it was the security agencies that prevented the miscreants from gaining entry into the hotel.\n\nAccording to him, the security agencies advised him against insisting on going to the venue of the congress which he said prompted him to get across to the APC National Secretariat in Abuja where he was directed to delegate the Committee Secretary to conduct the Oyo APC state congress at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium.\n\nCongress eventually held\n\nHowever, the Oyo APC state congress finally kicked off at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium at about noon with the accreditation of delegates with thousands of the party loyalists gathering at a portion of the stadium complex having been locked out of the stadium\u2019s main bowl earlier agreed to be the the venue.\n\nAmidst the confusion, 36 new state ofdicials were elected for APC in Oyo state with Hon Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu emerging the new state Chairman, Olaide Moshood Abass the deputy Chairman, Mojeed Olaoya, Joshua Oyebamiji Atiku, Tajudeen Lannipe, as State Secretary; Sijuade Adigun, Woman Leader; and Abdul Salam Muhammed Deji, Legal Adviser.\n\nTo stamp authority on those elected amidst the controversy, the motion for the adoption of Hon Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu as Chairman as well as other 35 members of the new executives was moved by a member of House of Representatives, Hon Dokun Odebunmi, seconded by a former Majority Leader of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Kehinde Subair.\n\nAcceptance speech\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the new Oyo APC Chairman, Hon Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu promised to do the needful within the party by embarking on instance reconciliation moves towards bringing back all those against the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium congress that produced him as the new Chairman for the main opposition party in Oyo state to be in a better position to face the challenges ahead of the party particularly in wrestling power back from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, saying, \u201callthanks and adoration to Almighty God for making today\u2019s State Congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, a successful one.Before, I proceed with my speech, let\u2019s have one minute silence in memories of two founding fathers of our great party, His Excellency (Dr.) Lamidi Onaolapo Adesina (Great Lam) and His Excellency (Dr.) Isiaq Abiola Ajimobi (Shehu). May Almighty Allah grant the departed former governors Aljana Fridauz. Amin.\n\n\u201cI am highly honoured to stand before great leaders and teeming members of APC as duly elected State Chairman APC Oyo State. Dear Delegates, I am humbled by the great honour you have conferred on me and the sacred trust you have bestowed on me; and with extreme humility, \u201cI accept this responsibility. On behalf of myself, and on behalf of my co-executives, who are surrounding me here right now. We have undertaken to lead this party to electoral victories in 2023 and beyond .\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s state congress of our great party signals beginning of another chapter. I belong to no one, I belong to all members of our great party. My main tasks are to unite all tendencies within the party and to lead APC to victories in 2023 general elections and beyondThis is a heavy responsibility. But I assure our teeming members, it is a responsibility we will not take very lightly. I pledge to do my utmost, God being on my side, to justify the faith and the confidence that APC members have imposed on me and all the new members of the state executives of our great party. I hail Hon. Gambo Lawan-led 7-man State Congress Committee for conducting a very transparent and peaceful state congress\u201d .\n\n\u201cWe have shamed our critics, going by the peaceful conduct of today\u2019s exercise. There is no winner, no vanquished as far as today\u2019s exercise is concerned. I appeal to all the party stakeholders to maintain the love and interest of our great party within their hearts.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s exercise wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the cooperation of the Nigerian security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It is a popular saying that the word T-E-A-M was an acronym that stands for \u2018Together Everyone Achieves More.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo, when we embrace teamwork, without worrying about who gets the credit, it is always amazing how much people get done. As observed by scholars, a boat doesn\u2019t go forward if each one is rowing their own way. Teamwork divides the task and multiplies the success. We are not a team because we work together. We are a team because we respect, trust, and care for each other.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all members of this party to join hands together for the electoral victories of our party in 2023 and beyond. This acceptance speech will be incomplete if I fail to give kudos to Governor Mai Buni of Yobe State, who is the Chairman of our Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC, for a job well done. The committee has emplaced justice without favouritism.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, I solemnly solicit the maximum support and cooperation of co-aspirants, critical stakeholders and our teeming members. Join hands with us to take back Oyo state from the misruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023 general elections.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat is, however, clear about the scenario is the fact that the crisis emanating from the congress would mean a lot to the survival or otherwise of the party in the state as the 2023 general elections draw nearer hence the need for the party to quickly put its house in order to prevent a repeat of its 2019 experience.\n\nAs at present, there is no doubt in the fact that all is not well in Oyo state APC amidst the one week mandate given to stakeholders and leaders in the party to do the needful on the lists before resending it back to Abuja National Secretariat for the much awaited final decision on what becomes of the congress outcome.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nFourteen persons have been arrested in connection with the siege on Justice Mary Odili\u2019s apartment in Abuja, the police said on Thursday.\n\nSome of the suspects include a fake Chief Superintendent of Police, Lawrence Ajodo; a contributing editor with one of the national dailies, Stanley Nkwazema, and an Islamic scholar.\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, paraded the suspects in Abuja and explained that their arrest followed a swift investigation by the police.\n\nAt least ten more persons linked with the incident including two military personnel are at large, the police spokesman added.\n\nREAD ALSO: Wike Gives FG 48-Hour Ultimatum To Probe Raid On Justice Odili\u2019s Residence\n\nThe arrest is the latest in a series of events since some armed men laid siege on Justice Odili\u2019s apartment in Maitama.\n\nThe incident drew criticisms from many quarters including the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, and human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, among others.\n\nWike had given the Federal Government a 48-hour ultimatum to get the perpetrators and claimed that the incident was an assassination attempt.\n\n\u201cWe think that there is an attempt to assassinate Justice Mary Odili, the husband and members of the family, there are no two ways about it. If they had succeeded, all the Federal Government would have told us (is that) we will get to the bottom of the matter because that has always been the normal language,\u201d Wike said during a press conference in Abuja on October 31.\n\n\u201cThe issue here has nothing to do with the Attorney General, we are happy he said he is not aware. We said, okay since you are not aware, we are giving you 48 hours to tell us who is responsible.\u201d\n\nThe NBA had also called on the Federal Government to set up a panel to probe the siege, describing it as an assault on the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe grave implications of this possibility leave a lot to be desired,\u201d the president of the NBA, Olumide Akpata, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhen viewed in the context of a similar raid on the premises of Supreme Court Justices in 2016, the rationale of which was never fully explained or indeed justified, the NBA interprets last night\u2019s incident as a part of an orchestrated affront on the judiciary, designed to intimidate and ridicule the judiciary,\u201d the NBA boss added.\n\n\u2018An impostor\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali, has vowed to diligently prosecute the paraded suspects.\n\nIn a statement signed by spokesperson Mba, the police said it had recovered three vehicles and a laptop computer, printer and flash drive used for the production of fake identity cards from the suspects.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force has arrested a total of fourteen (14) suspects including the principal suspect \u2013 a fake Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) \u2013 for complicity in the failed criminal trespass on the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Odili on Friday, 29th October, 2021,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe suspects were arrested following investigations conducted by detectives from the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) which clearly revealed the criminal involvement and individual roles the suspects played in the invasion of the residence of the revered Supreme Court Judge. Recall that the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc (+), NPM, fdc, on 1st November, 2021, affirmed that the Force did not authorize security operatives to carry out any assignment in or around the residence of Justice Mary Odili and directed the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) to carry out a discrete investigation with the aim of bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cThe suspects; Ajodo Lawrence \u2018m\u2019 (principal suspect), Michael Diete-Spiff \u2018m\u2019, Bar. Alex Onyekuru \u2018m\u2019, Bayero Lawal \u2018m\u2019, Bar. Igwe Ernest \u2018m\u2019, Aliyu Umar Ibrahim \u2018m\u2019, Maimuna Maishanu \u2018f\u2019, Ayodele Akindipe \u2018m\u2019, Yusuf Adamu \u2018m\u2019, Bashir Musa \u2018m\u2019, ASP Mohammed Yahaya \u2018m\u2019, Stanley Nkwazema \u2018m\u2019, Shehu Jibo \u2018m\u2019 and Abdullahi Adamu \u2018m\u2019, L/CPL Mike (other name unknown) \u2018m\u2019, are members of a well-organized criminal gang with a web-like involvement of individuals drawing from their different competences, professional background and social contacts in perfecting the criminal plot. Membership of the syndicate include suspects with background in public service, business, law, journalism, banking, amongst others.\n\n\u201cThe facts of the case from Police Investigations have it that one Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, an acclaimed whistleblower, following a baseless and unverified information he got from one Yusuf Adamu \u2013 parading himself as the godson of Chief Peter Odili \u2013 that there is a huge sum of money in foreign currencies starched in the residence of Her Lordship, Justice Mary Odili located at No. 7, Imo River Street, Maitama, initiated processes aimed at illegally recovering the said money. Consequently, the syndicate contacted one Bashir Musa, a clerical staff of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who in turn sought the assistance of two (2) others \u2013 Shehu Jibo and Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower was later introduced to one Bayero Lawal who falsely presented himself as a Director in EFCC. He took the whistleblower to one Hajiya Maimuna Maishanu who in turn took them to her cousin, Michael Diete-Spiff, who claimed to be the Director of Foreign Currency Operation of Ghost\u2019s Account for Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Recovery Panel, purportedly operating under the Federal Ministry of Justice \u2013 an agency that in fact does not exist. Diete-Spiff later introduced the whistleblower to one Lawrence Ajodo with the aid of one Godwin (currently at large). From this moment, Lawrence Ajodo \u2013 who falsely claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) and also the officer-in-charge of a non-existing Asset Recovery Panel at the Federal Ministry of Justice took over the planning and execution of the illicit operation. Through the assistance of one Ayodele Akindipe, an herbalist, the fake CSP procured the services of an Assistant Superintendent of Police and two (2) Soldiers for the failed operation. The fake CSP also elicited the services of a journalist, one Stanley Nkwazema and two (2) lawyers namely Bar. Alex Onyekuru and Bar. Igwe Ernest. While the journalist was expected to play the blackmail role, the lawyers were expected to help the syndicate in perfecting court documents and processes. The fake CSP later deposed to an affidavit and eventually obtained a search warrant meant for the execution of the raid.\n\n\u201cInvestigations so far conducted by the Police show that the suspects criminally trespassed on the residence of Her Lordship but were not allowed to execute the search warrant due to the lawful resistance from Police officers on guard duty at her residence. Police findings also revealed that the principal suspect \u2013 Lawrence Ajodo \u2013 is an impostor and not a police officer as he falsely claimed. Similarly, the Ghost\u2019s Account for Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Tax Recovery Panel purportedly operating under the Federal Ministry of Justice does not exist at the Federal Ministry of Justice neither is it registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. Also, the signature of the Honourable Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN) on the ID card presented by the fake CSP during the raid was forged. The Search Warrant which the suspects procured from a Magistrate Court for purposes of searching the premises of Justice Odili, was also obtained under false representation. The entire criminal operation has no authorization of any known Security Agency or Federal Government Ministry/Department.\n\n\u201cThree (3) vehicles used by the suspects for the illegal invasion and a laptop computer, printer and flash drive used for the production of the fake ID cards were recovered from the suspects by the Police investigators.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, investigation is being intensified to arrest the other seven (7) suspects including two (2) persons believed to be personnel of the Nigeria Army who were physically present during the raid, and fully dressed in Army uniform.\n\n\u201cThe IGP, while assuring diligent prosecution of the suspects, reiterated the commitment of the Force to continue to advance the rule of law and combatting all forms of crimes and criminality in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has accused the Federal Government of intimidating the judiciary ahead of the 2023 general elections in the country.\n\nWike\u2019s criticism followed a recent invasion of the residence of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court in her Abuja residence by men believed to be security operatives.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday during a special court session to mark the opening of the 2021/2022 Legal Year of the Rivers State Judiciary in Port Harcourt, the governor said the Federal Government wants to continue to ride roughshod unchecked over the rule of law and the sanctity of the country\u2019s electoral system, hence, the renewed attack on judicial officers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Police Arrest 14 Linked With Siege On Justice Odili\u2019s House\n\n\u201cAlthough it is still early morning in our democratic match towards 2023, the attack on Justice Mary Odili is a prelude to many more and even worse political maneuverings we should be prepared to experience from the APC-led Federal Government, which having lost relevance and popular support is becoming more and more desperate over its dwindling political fortunes by the day,\u201d Wike said.\n\n\u201cWhile cases with political undertones, including the constitutional validity of certain sections of the recent amendments to the 2010 Electoral Act, if assented to by Mr President, would necessarily come before our courts; what is important is the duty and capacity of our judiciary to save our democracy and the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is the responsibility of the government at all levels to protect the judiciary and accord the courts such assistance as they may require enabling them to safeguard their independence, advance the rule of law, and dispense justice equally and fairly to all citizens.\n\nWhile the present Federal Government has been very weak in resourcing and strengthening the judiciary, Wike said it has been very strong and readily predisposed to ridiculing the entire institution and subjecting individual judges to both physical and psychological trauma for its own self-interest.\n\n\u201cWe all witnessed the infamous midnight raids on judicial residences and the subjection of some judges, to illegal raids, arrests and detentions by agents of the Federal Government purportedly carrying out a baseless sting operation back in 2016\n\n\u201cSince then the intimidation of judges whose judgments, intellectual or moral disposition they are not comfortable with has continued unrelenting with the latest attack on a peaceful mother, wife of a former Governor and Justice of the Supreme Court, our own highly revered Hon. Justice Mary Odili\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that we allow these intimidations to become acceptable standards of behaviour and even become complicit in their unholy design to undermine the administration of justice when we all opt to keep quite in the face of these assaults,\u201d Governor Wike added.\n\nGovernor Wike, who commended the leaders of the Nigerian Bar Association, the Chief Justice of Nigeria and members of the public for promptly condemning the idiotic siege on judiciary, said they must quickly move beyond the verbal protestations to unveil those behind the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s residence and ensure that they all are held to account for their actions, otherwise this impunity would never cease to rear its ugly head in the country.\n\nHe challenged the Federal Government to come clean on this infamy with the names, identities and affiliations of those allegedly arrested for their roles or found to have been involved in the attack on the residence of Justice Odili, if it is not to be perceived as the primary mastermind.\n\nSpeaking on the proposed setting up of law school campuses, the governor urged the management of the Nigerian Law School, the Council of Legal Education and the Federal Government to see the folly in the plan, and nib the idea from the bud before it causes more damage to a foremost institution that is already severely challenged for lack of adequate funding.\n\nHe explained that the Port Harcourt Campus of the Nigerian Law School being built by the Rivers State Government was consciously demanded for and approval secured from the Council of Legal Education and ultimately from President Muhammadu Buhari, through the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and named after late Nabo Graham-Douglas, SAN.\n\nWike added, \u201cHere again, some lazy and uninformed characters have criticised our Law School development project with the unfounded and lousy allegation that it lacks budgetary provisions in our 2021 budget, even when they conceded to the propriety of the project and the optimal benefits it would attract to the State and the business community.\u201d",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele has urged French investors to invest in Nigeria, describing the country as the best investment destination in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at the Paris Peace Forum in France, Emefiele said Nigeria has the largest economy and population in Africa, and it is being projected to be the third-largest population in the world by 2050.\n\nWhile convincing investors to put money into the Nigerian financial market, the CBN governor said, \u201cIf you think about investing in Africa. Africa holds the best frontier for development in the world today, and your yield from investments today is the highest in Africa\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying Nigeria should take the lead. I am saying to you the foreign investors if you think about Africa for the opportunity and investment, you don\u2019t have a choice you will have to look at Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria has the largest economy and population in Africa, and it is being projected to be the third largest population in the world by 2050 \u2014 if you do think about investing in Africa \u2014 join us in developing Nigeria and Africa continent.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN had projected that the economy would grow by about 2.9 percent in 2021 as oil prices surge in the global market.\n\n\u201cAnd the possible outlook is due to the high oil price which today is above $80 per barrel, the implementation of the economic sustainability plan which was put in place during the period of the pandemic and a rebound in our manufacturing activities and economic activities in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the country\u2019s inflation which was \u201cas high as 18.17% during the pandemic\u201d and is \u201cabout 16.6% today\u201d should be able to moderate to about \u201c15.35% by December 2021 and further down to about 14.91% by February 2022.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on FG\u2019s diversification plan, Emefiele said that the present administration is providing access for players in the manufacturing industry to access loans with single interest.\n\n\u201cBefore the president came on board in 2015, a couple of our textile industries, some of our manufacturing industries due to certain challenges they faced in the economy closed down,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe are now looking forward to making sure that we reposition and reopen these industries again.\n\n\u201cWe are making granting of credit easy for these industries so that they can embrace and attract cheap credit, long term credit and I can say in a long time in the history of the financial system in Nigeria, manufacturing sectors can access credit at single digit interest rate of no more than 9%.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor said the Dangote refinery would help conserve foreign exchange, save the cost of logistics and transportation \u2014 and the price of petroleum products in Nigeria can be more competitive and more affordable for Nigerians.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

          "text": "Migrants stranded inside Belarus threw rocks and branches at Polish border guards and used logs to try to break down a razor wire fence overnight in new attempts to force their way into the European Union, the authorities in Warsaw said on Thursday.\n\nThe EU on Wednesday accused Belarus of mounting a \u201chybrid attack\u201d on the bloc by encouraging thousands of migrants fleeing poverty and war-torn areas to try to cross into Poland, and is gearing up to impose new sanctions on Minsk.\n\nThe crisis has sparked a new confrontation between the West and Russia, which dispatched two nuclear capable strategic bombers to patrol Belarusian airspace on Wednesday in a show of support for its ally. Belarus said the planes carried out drills for a second day on Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin said Russia had nothing to do with tensions on the border and suggested the presence of heavily armed people on both sides \u2013 an apparent reference to Belarusian and Polish border guards \u2013 was a source of concern. The prospect of sanctions on Belarus a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d, it said.\n\nTrapped between two borders, the migrants have endured freezing weather in makeshift camps. Poland has reported at least seven migrant deaths in the months-long crisis and other migrants have expressed fear they would die.\n\nNone of around 150 migrants gathered near the town of Bialowieza managed to breach the border, the spokeswoman for the border guards service Ewelina Szczepanska told Reuters, saying there had been 468 attempts at illegal crossings on Wednesday.\n\nNeighbouring EU state Lithuania, which like Poland has imposed a state of emergency on the border, also reported new attempts to breach the frontier.\n\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the defence ministers of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said they saw the crisis as \u201cvery alarming, and unequivocally condemn the deliberate escalation of the ongoing hybrid attack by the Belarusian regime, which is posing serious threats to European security.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge groups of people are being gathered and transported to the border area, where they are then forced to illegally cross the border. This increases the possibility of provocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into military domain,\u201d they said.\n\nThe bloc accuses Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of manufacturing the migrant crisis in revenge for earlier sanctions after the veteran leader unleashed a violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020.\n\nRussian flag carrier Aeroflot AFLT.MM on Thursday denied any involvement in organising mass transportation of migrants to Belarus, after its shares fell on a news report that it could face EU sanctions over the crisis on the Belarus-Poland border. read more\n\nThe Belarusian authorities said more than 2,000 migrants were at the border. Lukashenko and Russia have blamed the EU for the migrant crisis and said the EU was not living up to its own humanitarian values by preventing the migrants from crossing.\n\nLarge groups of people fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere started flying to Minsk this spring. They then travel to the border with EU members Poland, Lithuania or Latvia by taxi, bus or cars provided by human smugglers and try to cross.\n\nPolish authorities say the number of flights to Belarus from the Middle East has increased dramatically in recent months, with the Polish prime minister calling on the EU to take action to stem the flow of airlines ferrying migrants to Minsk.\n\nMost migrants use travel agencies across the Middle East which partner with Belarusian companies to book tourism packages that usually include visa, flight and accommodation.\n\nThe price of the whole journey varies and can reach up to about $14,000. In October, Minsk restricted the number of travel agencies in Belarus allowed to deliver tourism invitations, and smugglers as well as agencies have reported a rise in prices.",
