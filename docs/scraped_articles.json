He said he had returned home for the weekend yesterday( Saturday) evening and only informed the Oraifite Area Commander (ACP Afolabi) and few others that he was around.\n\nThe Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, confirmed the incident.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt was around 2.30am that they surrounded his country home. Is it an offense for someone to defend IPOB? Barr Ejiofor is doing his job as a lawyer. Where in the world is a legal practitioner harassed because he represents an organization?\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army invaded and burnt his house on 2nd December 2019 and killed more than 10 people. Since then, they have been trailing and harassing him. The whole world must hear this because the Nigerian government must get what they are looking for from IPOB.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Emeka Umeagbalasi, who condemned the invasion, said, \u201cWe call on the Nigerian Government to stop this madness and crudity.\n\nHe added, \u201cBy these crudities, the Nigerian Government is setting the country on fire the more.\n\n\u201cUnder Nigeria\u2019s extant laws, applicable globally, Barr Ifeanyi Ejiofor and other licensed legal practitioners have the right and duty to represent and defend any citizen or citizens or national or nationals irrespective of the gravity of crime(s) alleged to have been committed. The security forces of Nigeria are hereby called upon to withdraw and discontinue their siege and follow due process.\n\n\u201cIf Barr Ifeanyi Ejiofor is legitimately wanted for any crime, due processes must be followed to the letter. This is more so when he called and informed the chief police officer in the area (ACP Afolabi) of his being around for weekend rest.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted on the telephone, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, said he had no details of the incident.\n\nHe said, \u201cLike you must have noticed, I have been on call since morning.

Ndudi Elumelu, on Saturday and available to Vanguard, described the suspension as \u201cprovocative, obnoxious and unjustifiable\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSOCNG condemns FG\u2019s suspension of Twitter\n\nThe Caucus warned the government against causing further social unrest in the country, calling for immediate reversal of the suspension.\n\nThe caucus said the decision of the Federal Government to suspend Twitter \u201csmacks of intolerance, insensitivity, and aversion to the views, opinions, and aspirations of Nigerian citizens, especially the youths, on matters of state.\u201d\n\nThe statement stated further \u201cOur caucus rejects this thoughtless decision of the Federal Government which amounts to a clampdown and a direct infringement on the rights of Nigerians to free speech as guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt further shows the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration as one that is unwilling to listen to Nigerians but ready to use any means to suppress and subjugate its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Minority Caucus is disturbed that the suspension of Twitter in the country came after the social media platform deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets.\n\n\u201cSuch response by the Federal Government has raised further concerns over the APC-led administration\u2019s disturbing rating on issues of political intolerance, abuse of rights, and violation of rules in our country.\n\n\u201cThe minority caucus cautions that the development is capable of leading to further restiveness among Nigerians and worsen the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, this action of the Federal Government, coming at a time the National Assembly is conducting its public hearing towards the amendment of the constitution, may constitute a major setback capable of diminishing public confidence in the exercise as well as other processes genuine efforts by the legislature to strengthen democratic tenets in the country\u201d.\n\nThe Minority caucus, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately reverse the suspension placed on Twitter so as not to exacerbate the already tense situation in the country.",

PHOTO: NAN\n\nIn 2012, it was widely reported that Joshua sponsored a Nigerian student doing a PhD in the U.K.\n\nHis humanitarian relief involvement was outstanding as Joshua supported efforts in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and April 2016 in Ecuador, where he gave humanitarian aid worth over $500,000.\n\nIn Ecuador, he funded the rebuilding of a rural school destroyed during the earthquake.\n\nJoshua had sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area in Haiti and also instituted a field hospital called \u2018Clinique Emmanuel\u2019.\n\nHe also supported several groups of Nigerian returnees to settle back into the country, following their attempt to travel illegally to Europe.\n\nOne of his most significant reconciliatory efforts was his involvement in the meeting of the family of the late President of Liberia, Samuel Doe, with the former warlord Yormie Johnson, who was responsible for Doe\u2019s death.\n\nThe Nigerian government in recognition of his humanitarian activities, gave him a National Honour, Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) in 2008.\n\nThe United Nations also gave him a letter of appreciation.\n\nThe Arewa Youth Forum, predominantly Muslim organisation, recognised him as Ambassador of Peace and ZAKA, Israel\u2019s primary rescue and recovery voluntary service, gave him an \u2018award of excellence\u2019 .\n\nUntil his death on Saturday after one of his evening services, Joshua was married to Evelyn Joshua and had three children.\n\nProphet TB Joshua\u2019s last words in public were : \u201cWatch and pray.\u201d \u201cOne life for Christ is all we have; one life for Christ is so dear\u201d.\n\nMr Kunle Olowoopejo, the Executive Chairman, Egbe-Idimu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos, described TB Joshua as a complete definition of what humanity should be.\n\nAccording to him, he was generous and no matter your colour, ethnic, tribe, language or religion you may belong to, his hands of fellowship has no bound and that\u2019s why both young and old keep echoing \u201cAlaanu Mekunnu lo.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Synagogue church, Prophet TB Joshua left legacy of service and sacrifice to God\u2019s Kingdom of which will continue to live on for generations yet unborn.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The proscribed organisation denies involvement.\n\nOwalo enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2013 and was attached to 102 Guard Brigade Battalion until his dismissal in 2019. He trained ESN fighters on combat operations such as ambush and use of firearms.\n\nOrji and Steven, enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2015 and 2017 respectively and were trained at the 133 Special Force Battalion. They joined IPOB after their sack.\n\nPolitical class using religion to divide Nigeria \u2013 Anglican Bishop\n\nThe trio revealed IPOB promised them that the leader, Nnamdi Kanu, would sponsor them for military training abroad, and make them Generals in Biafra.\n\nOwalo, 32, a former Lance Corporal married with two children, said life has not been easy since he was booted out of the Army.\n\nHe recalled how a man connected him to one Mr. Williams who spoke about Biafra and the dream to achieve a sovereign state. Owalo was invited for a meeting.\n\n\u201cI was given a half bag of garri and five tubers of yam. They visited my wife and children. I said I was making plans for reinstatement into the Army. They told me that I should forget about it; that Nnamdi Kanu would make life better for me if I trained the ESN.\n\n\u201cThey told me that I would be taken abroad for more military training. They also promised me that after Birafra had been actualised, I would become a General in the Biafran Army.\n\n\u201cI took an oath of allegiance to Nnamdi Kanu. I vowed that I would die if I betrayed the Biafra struggle. I was given the sum of N100,000. I was then moved to a forest in Abia where I trained over 4,000 men in October 2020.\n\nBiafra: Nigerian forces arrest ex-soldier for training 2,000 IPOB ESN fighters\n\n\u201cI met other dismissed soldiers there. We commenced the moment I arrived; started with push-ups, moral training and fire movement known as field craft. The camp managers did not trust us or invited us to their meetings.\u201d\n\nThree months into the training, Owalo said they were sent to Delta. They met a man alias \u2018Be-In-Spirit\u2019, but later discovered the camp in the state had been shut down.\n\nThe second suspect, Steven, 33, said he joined the Nigeria Army in June 2017, trained for four months in Kontagora in Niger and was later attached to the Special Force Unit.\n\nSteven was at Kabba in Kogi for another three months training, and Takum in Taraba for additional training before deployment to 133 Battalion.\n\nHe claimed the Army arrested him for going AWOL after sustaining an injury. It was in detention that he met Chinasa Orji.\n\nSteven said Orji told him a friend called from Senegal and hinted that Kanu was recruiting soldiers to train IPOB fighters and would pay twice the money they were earning.\n\n\u201cHe said Kanu would also take the soldiers abroad, and when Biafra was achieved, he would make them Generals in Biafra. I accepted the offer and they paid us N100,000 each, twice the salary I was receiving from the Army.\u201d\n\nSteven recounted their trip to Abia, the loyalty oath sworn to Kanu, and the training on combat and special forces manoeuvring, among others.\n\nAfter one month in the Abia camp, they were transferred to another for three weeks. But when he started doubting the promises which were not forthcoming, Steven returned to Abuja and got a security job. He was arrested afterwards.\n\nOrji, 23 years old and a father, enlisted into the Army in 2015 and was dismissed in 2018 after attending the burial of his elder brother.\n\nAccording to him, the deceased, also a soldier, was killed on August 22, 2018, while on escort duty in Bayelsa State.\n\nOrji complained that his superiors refused to give him a pass. After he left without permission, his bank account was frozen. He was arrested and detained upon return.\n\nBut he had access to his phone in detention and chatted with a friend, Victor, who notified him that Kanu needed soldiers to train some ESN members.\n\n\u201cI told my friend Steven, who was also in detention, and he accepted. They sent us money for transport from Yola in Adamawa to Abia. We were taken into the forest where we took oaths and started training the men. I was paid N100,000.\u201d",

          "title": "Blueprint for Nigerian literature formed by founding fathers in 1981",
          "text": "Mallam Denja Abdullahi, the immediate past president of the Association of Nigerian Authors ANA has said that the greatest legacy the likes of Professor Chinua Achebe and his contemporaries have left for Nigerian writers was the formation of ANA in 1981. As new programmes to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the association in ten cities continue to unfold, Abdullahi states in this encounter with Edozie Udeze that ANA has more to offer the Nigerian society in this dispensation and beyond.\n\nAs the Association of Nigerian Authors turns 40 what in your view are the greatest highlights of the writers body in the years past?\n\nThe formation of the Association itself in 1981 was a remarkable highlight brought about by the insight of the founder father, Chinua Achebe, to convoke an assemblage of Nigerian writers to attend to the \u201cbusiness side of writing,\u201d to protect \u2018the freedom and safety of writers in the society,\u201d and behind these all was the quest to unite the divergent literary imaginations across the country for the overall development of Nigerian literature. Since that time, the Association has been consistent in providing a resilient platform to announce new writers and new writings through its numerous literary development activities such as workshops, seminars, conferences, publications of books and journals, administration of literary prizes, landmark celebration of literary milestones of prominent Nigerian writers, school outreach programmes, literary and reading campaigns, contribution to social discourse and struggle for social, political and environmental justice and ensuring that literature remains relevant in the front line of the Nigerian society.\n\nANA has undoubtedly contributed to the glittering literary and intellectual careers of many Nigerian writers at home and abroad today. Most of the persons and groups you find today promoting literature in the Nigerian public space via various literary groups cut their teeth in ANA or learnt the rubrics within ANA or from ANA. ANA was and still is the original blueprint that has given birth to the flourish being experienced today in the Nigerian literary circle. The profile of ANA is simply solid and intimidating but since it is in our manner as a society to keep records poorly and to take things for granted, if you do not reflect and look around objectively, you may erroneously compare the Association to some upstart literary groups we have today with the modern age capacity to amplify their puny little achievements. There are a lot of specifics one can attach to the broad achievements of ANA that I have highlighted above and it will take a book to do that. The latest remarkable highlight of the Association as at today is that the Association is about realizing the dream of the late soldier-poet, Mamman Jiya Vatsa ,of giving Nigerian writers a vantage place in the cultural landscape of the capital city of Nigeria Abuja ,with the on-going construction of a sprawling multi-use facilities at the Mamman Vatsa Writers\u2019Village in Mpape, Abuja.\n\nAs the immediate past president of ANA what are those things you would have done differently if you have another chance?\n\nI do not think I have anything I would have done differently because all what I did in office were not solely mine but what the Association desired from its leadership as at the time I was at the helm as President. Remember, before I started taking any step as president, my executive, with my prompting, went through a rigorous process of consultations, administering of questionnaires to members of ANA nationwide and holding a three-day strategic plan development workshop led by a team of professional consultants in the field and involving members drawn across all strata of the Association, which culminated in the production of a STRATEGIC PLAN (2017-2022) for the Association. All what I did in office was in adherence to that strategic plan which is still operational and I am also proud to say that I achieved in office all but one of my 14-point agenda that I put forward when I was campaigning for the office. On the human angle, there were some variables I was not in control of and that is why nothing in life that a human being does can be perfect; and as such mistakes and misjudgments must occur and some did occur during my time as President. Nevertheless, given another chance,I do not think I will act or do things with significant difference.\n\nWhat are the greatest tributes to the founding fathers of ANA as the joys of 40 years blooms?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe founding fathers were visionary and must be commended for that. The seed they sowed has bloomed and has become sturdy and given birth to remarkable writings and literary careers. Some of the founding fathers are still with us and they have remained a source of inspiration and encouragement to the younger generations that came after them. They must also be appreciated for not losing their composure even in the face of juvenile insolence from some irreverent members of the Association who overtime paid too much premium to the political side of the Association than the literary. Some of the founding fathers that are still around have all been remarkably productive and prolific as writers foregrounding the fact that writing should not cease at anytime and that the Association was not formed to replace writing but rather to enhance it.\n\nHow have writers utilized and harmonized Nigerian cultures as their sources to grow Nigerian literature?\n\nFrom the use of a cultural source base to propel and project Nigerian writings by the first generation writers, other succeeding generations have made use of Nigerian cultures in their own unique ways. The diversity of themes and styles that is the hallmark of Nigerian literature can be attributed to the multicultural tapestry of the Nigerian nation. Our writers have profited greatly from the many stories, worldviews, philosophies and performative tendencies of cultures available in Nigeria. These boundless cultural resources of Nigeria are still being tapped in so many subtle ways by Nigerian writers and that is why our literature even within the vista of world literature cannot be ignored. To cite just one example, what Chigozie Obioma did with the use of the narrative trope of the chi(from the Igbo worldview) as narrator in his book Orchestra of Minorities, made all the difference in that book being shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2019. The book itself has an originality, language and a style that is startling and it is a delight to read: all due to the author\u2019s uncommon use of a cultural heritage.\n\nDrama and prose which has demonstrated the greatest value for Nigerian literature?\n\nBoth have been very valuable and even the ubiquitous poetry too! All the genres have been robustly used in Nigerian literature and Nigeria has produced writers in all the genres that are outstanding in African and world literature. But I see a tendency today to privilege prose over the other two genres. Maybe it is because prose appears to operate within a more universal literary framework while drama and poetry can sometimes be culture-bound.\n\nTen city tour by ANA to mark the anniversary, how possible in the face of persistent insecurity in the land?\n\nThe security challenge in Nigeria today is enormous but it is the duty of the purveyors of the literary imagination to imagine a better and more secured society. That is why writers must draw from the past, mix that with the insistent present to forecast a better future. You should note that even within this national security challenge, literary activities are still been held by ANA at the national and chapters\u2019 level across the country. Writers are creative people and they can always shape their activities to fit into or go around the challenges of the time. I expect ANA in the Ten City Tour to address the security challenge in the many activities that will be held in those ten cities. The theme of the Ten City Tour I understands harps on the resilience of Nigerian Literature. I think the writers must project the resilience of the Nigerian Federation as evidenced in the resilience of Nigerian Literature. The security problem has always been with us in Nigeria, it is just that it morphs from one shape into another as Nigeria evolves politically. I remember ANA focused on the relationship between Literature and Security in its convention which held in 2012 at Uyo, Akwa -Ibom State. I expect ANA to contribute their quota in finding solutions to the present security challenge facing the country and they should use the opportunity of the ten city tour to advocate for peace, social justice and harmonious living among our people. Writers should migrate some of the good stories they tell within their texts into the public spheres in further creatively communicative ways to assist in building a peaceful and more secured society- a society secured against injustice, hunger, illiteracy and mindless violence.",

          "text": "By Christy Anyawu\n\nMaryanne Ahneeka Iwuchukwu is a lady of many parts. She\u2019s a model, engineer, television presenter and entrepreneur.\n\nThree years ago, Ahneeka came to limelight when she took part in the Big Brother Naija reality show. In this chat, she talked about her growing up, love life and new TV programme, Jollof Show. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us briefly about yourself?\n\nI am Maryanne Ahneeka Iwuchukwu. I hail from Oraifite, Anambra State. I am a Chemical Engineer and also an entrepreneur. I am pursuing a degree in Education at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. Three yeas ago, I was on the Big Brother Naija reality show, the Double Wahala edition. Now, I have moved on from there to TV presenting.\n\nTell us about your growing up?\n\nMy mum is an academic, an educator. It\u2019s from her I got my flair for education. My dad is an entrepreneur, but he is retired now. They are very instrumental in terms of discipline and values I portray as a lady. I\u2019m very proud of my discipline, I mean in terms of values, they were very keen in support of me. This venture of going into Big Brother after graduation as an engineer was very offline. They didn\u2019t understand it, but they understood the daughter they raised, they trusted their handwork. I made the point not to disappoint them and I\u2019m working so hard to let them know I\u2019m not practicing as an engineer, but I\u2019m making as much in bank as engineers will.\n\nWhat\u2019s your new TV programme all about?\n\nI am the host of Jollof TV show produced by Zikel Cosmetics. Zikel birthed the idea and they approached me to be a part of it. The show has started airing on WAPTV, DSTV, GOTV, StarTimes and some terrestrial stations from the first Friday in May. Basically, Jollof Show is about having interactions with your favourite celebrities. The show is not just about coming to have fun; we also get to learn a few things about lifestyle, fitness, grooming, working-out, and use of slimming teas. So, it\u2019s just about coming together and having a beautiful blend of spices like we have in jollof rice. The show has something for everyone. The context of what jollof means is what we are applying on the show.\n\nWhen you are not hosting a show, what else do you do?\n\nI\u2019m a spice of everything, just like jollof rice. I\u2019m a chemical engineer, an entrepreneur; I try my hands on different business ventures. You will be hearing new things about me soon.\n\nHow do you take time off to relax?\n\nThere\u2019s no relaxation on empty bank account. I believe now is the time to work. I am young, I am still energetic and I have this opportunity now, so why don\u2019t I work? Relaxation will come when I\u2019m sitting on my billion.\n\nHow did you cope with the lockdown?\n\nI was praying for Nigeria. I was praying not to catch Coronavirus. The world was standing still and I was part of the world standing still. I was learning new things online, taking few courses, and getting my post-graduate online.\n\nTell us about your romantic side, do you have any man in your life yet?\n\nI\u2019m not in a rush. Whoever comes I will just go with the flow. No pressure right now, if he comes, he comes; if he doesn\u2019t come, he doesn\u2019t come, bye! As much as everyone is telling me how old I am (for marriage), my thought is telling me how broke I am. No pressure to do anything.\n\nWhat is your kind of man?\n\nHe must have two legs; have two hands, but must have sense. That is the most important part I can\u2019t compromise. He can have one leg, but must have sense. That is very key to me. I\u2019m not looking for anything in particular; I will just know if my spirit can go with this person. I don\u2019t have a checklist.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young people?\n\nDo not wait on anything to be handed to you. As much as the government and other people owe you things, don\u2019t bank on that. The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, so go there and take it by force. Be ready to face disappointments. Don\u2019t get away by the things on social media. As a young person, half of what you see on social media is fake. So, do not compare your chapter one to another person\u2019s chapter 16. Nobody posts his or her failures on Instagram. Be patient with yourself, work as hard as you can. If you are a person of faith, don\u2019t forget that and when you get there, don\u2019t forget that faith too. Just be a good human being.",

          "title": "Twitter ban rewinds Nigeria to pre-internet darkness and reign of fear",
          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is its citizens\u2019 use of Twitter, and all media enabled by the internet.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought the country had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "text": "On behalf of the ownership of Farmsponsor Nig Ltd, we want to thank our sponsors for their unwavering support and trusting us as we work to improve the Agricultural sector in Nigeria.\n\nWe deeply share in your displeasure with the upset that the company has had in paying out its sponsors.\n\nThe past few days has been quite a challenge as the company has been facing some difficulties which has destabilized our crowd funding operations.\n\nThese challenge stems from the recent SEC cease announcement on all crowdfunding platforms by June 30, 2021. This has made it impractical for Farm-sponsor to continue its crowding operation as the notice came upon us abruptly, by the first week of June.\n\nWe are taking appropriate measures to see that all funds collected from every sponsor will be paid back accordingly.\n\n\n\nAn overview of Farmsponsor facilities and operational layout\n\nPlease bear with us as payments will likely be staggered. We are working to make payout as fast as possible but to be honest, it may take up to 18 \u2013 24 months to finish. Paying everyone at once will eat too deep into our operational cash flow. Let us continue to work to pay you.\n\nThe stated timeline is only but the very least. We are already working hard to see everyone is paid in the shortest of time, nevertheless we wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint twice so we have to settle for the stated projected timeframe.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that over the last two years, Farm-sponsor have accomplished a great deal, and we owe it to all your sponsorship.\n\nIn the time that we have been doing business together along with the funds you have trusted us with, we have been able to establish the following:\n\n\u2022 A 360,000-broiler Pen (biggest in South-South Nigeria).\n\n\u2022 60,000 capacity breeders pen (with over 10,000 laying breeder birds).\n\n\u2022 10 tons per hour feed mill.\n\n\u2022 24,000 per day fully automated chicken processing plant (recently installed and commissioned).\n\n\u2022 128,000 birds per week state of the art hatchery.\n\n\u2022 823 Hectares of land in Oyo State (valued above $3m).\n\n\u2022 A veterinary clinic and two retail supermarket outlets in the heart of Port Harcourt, amongst many other great features that we have achieved together.\n\nWe are just stating to make certain, perhaps you\u2019re in doubt that you have invested wisely.\n\nPart of our short term strategies is through overdraft or a term loan from some of our financial institutions. Our mid term strategy is through equity investment from institutional investors and we are willing to relinquish 30-50% of directors shares in the company. Our long term strategy would be direct revenue from the business, hence the 18-24 months.\n\nOur entire workforce is working tirelessly to ensure that we regain the trust you\u2019ve always had with Farmsponsor.\n\nIt\u2019s uneasy on our part that we are writing this letter instead of payment slips.\n\nWe apologize for any undue hardship or inconveniences that this might cause you.\n\nWe really appreciate your understanding, and support as well as believing in us as we walk this journey of emerging a stronger Farm-sponsor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAkpa Chike\n\nCo-founder, Globetrot Farmsponsor Nig Ltd.",

          "title": "How security agencies\u2019 invasion is killing businesses in South East",
          "text": "With the repeated focus on the South East states by the military and current siege in Imo State following the recent assassination of Ahmed Gulak, a former aide to Goodluck Jonathan, by unknown gunmen, the geopolitical zone is affected across board as people live their lives on the edge, businesses suffer and investors are looking towards other zones.\n\nSouth East, which is known for its entrepreneurial prowess, often said to be without government support, is currently fighting for survival if the military siege persists as the youthful population, which is the major workforce is hiding.\n\nFor the zone that survived the civil war, the recent three-day sit-at-home impacted its economy adversely as no economic activity took place, people feared for their lives and stayed at home.\n\nResidents are worried that the current siege to the zone by soldiers will result in shutting down of many businesses in a zone where government work is very scarce. Logistics and transport companies are already reducing their business volume across eastern states as tension heightens because of the ongoing military siege.\n\nEmeka Nwanganga, a supermarket owner in Egbu, a suburb of Owerri, the Imo State capital, has not opened his supermarket since the sit-at-home order for fear of uncertainty in the air.\n\nSome business premises have been visited often by security men looking for people the owners don\u2019t know, while the parents are advising the children to stay at home for now. The situation, according to Nwanganga, is worrying as the environment seems to return to the Covid-19 lockdown era.\n\nThe serious thought for many is the fact that the government is not paying salaries and businesses are made to suffer, they wonder how the people will survive.\n\nBusinessDay Sunday gathered that many young men that have meaning businesses, or those who manage shops have abandoned their shops in some parts of the zone for the fear of being arrested on trumped-up allegations.\n\nBede Eke, a member of the House of Representatives representing Abor Mbaise and Ngor Okpala Federal Constituency of Imo State, Thursday raised the alarm that security agents were killing innocent people in his constituency.\n\nHe said that some of his constituents had fled to the bush due to fear of being harassed by security operatives in their homes.\n\nEke particularly lamented the alleged killing of a young man, \u201cwho until his death owned a Shawarma shop just to make ends meet. He was shot by the Army.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, a founding member of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Chekwa Okorie warned security agencies to be careful not to degenerate the already tense situation in the South East, alleging that several killings were going on secretly.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe attitude of the security agency is creating tension in the South East; I mean what is happening now defies logic. When you said you have apprehended and killed the killers of Gulak why are you going round villages and communities and arresting and killing young men?\n\n\u201cA lot of people have been tortured and we don\u2019t know because it is not in the news. The leaders of the security agencies should be careful so that they do not further degenerate the tension in the South East\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, a former presidential candidate and activist, Martin Onovo condemned the situation, alleging that the situation in the South East was a deliberate plan by the current administration to forcefully take up lands belonging to the region.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Imo State is unfortunate and clearly shows the double standard of the Buhari administration. For me, I think what is happening there is a deliberate plan by this government to Fulanise the country, an expansionist agenda.\n\n\u201cThe killings have been deliberately carried out in Imo State; or how do you explain it when you said Gulak killers have been arrested and killed and you are still going after innocent people. The armed forces are conniving with bandits and Fulani people to cause havoc, killing and causing confusion across Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOnovo further stated that he was not surprised with the spate of insecurity and killings across Nigeria, alleging that the security agencies were abating the criminals and terrorists to cause havoc on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis people want land, even Danjuma and Baraje confirmed that they were brought in here from other countries. So, there is an expansionist agenda by this administration and what is happening has further confirmed it.\n\n\u201cWe should ask questions, even journalists should ask questions; this is a country where the Court has been shut for months and nobody is talking. Nigeria is a failed state, and the better we realise this.\n\n\u201cThese people are Fulani\u2019s, Bororo\u2019s, they want land to establish their home as a military base. It is a conquest agenda. The facts are clear, it is documented; all the missing arms money, why is the media not doing enough in questioning the government?\n\n\u201cThe government said they know where the bandits are and their sponsors. Why not arrest them? The Fulani were repelled in Kogi and Plateau States and after recovering their weapons, it was discovered that they were using Nigeria military weapons. The APC is the sponsor of these people,\u201d Onovo added.\n\nIn his response over the activities of soldiers and other security agents in South East, particularly in Imo State, Dubem Ofodile, an Abuja-based lawyer, said there was no justification for turning the zone into a war zone.\n\n\u201cWe all heard the outcry of Governor Hope Uzodinma that over 70 percent of some criminals arrested were not Igbo and that majority of the crimes going on in the state are perpetrated by elements outside Igboland and the Ebonyi governor confirmed that. So, the invasion of security agents can only be interpreted to me a calculated attempt to kill easterners in large number,\u201d Ofodile said\n\nToeing the same line, Joel Amakubi Amanze, an Owerri indigene and maritime lawyer, said that soldiers\u2019 rampage in Imo communities is illegal and uncalled for since Gulak\u2019s killers have been apprehended and executed by the police.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing rampage, it means the military does not trust the police despite the evidence of the killed assassins. I think the soldiers are in Imo for some ulterior motives,\u201d the angry indigene said.\n\nThe lawyer lamented that sending soldiers to Imo communities is illegal, counterfeits police efforts and would result in bloodbath of innocent citizens.\n\nAlso worried over the reason for sending soldiers on rampage in the zone, observers query why soldiers were not sent to other parts of the country where people are being killed every day, especially Benue and Plateau states where the killers are even boldly brandishing their weapons and openly claiming responsibility for heinous crimes, including murders.\n\n\u201cWhy did soldiers not invade Ondo communities to fish out killers of Afenifere chieftain, why are they not after killers of Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s security aide a few days ago? They are obeying orders and such orders are not good for the unity of this country; some people shouldn\u2019t die, while others live\u201d, Yinka Owoyemi, a public analyst and girl-child activist, said.\n\n\u201cDoes it mean the Federal Government will be sending soldiers to any place they kill someone to fish out the killers. For me, the Imo case is selective treatment, which is not good,\u201d she wondered.",

          "title": "Nigerians urge improved registration exercise as INEC moves to shore up voters\u2019 number",
          "text": "With less than two years to the 2023 general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced its readiness to begin a nationwide Continuous Voter Registration on June 28, and to deepen the use of technology in electoral process.\n\nThe registration exercise is aimed at shoring up number of voters across the country and to discourage voter apathy.\n\nEligible Nigerians that have clocked the age of 18 years, or have never been registered to vote or those who have experienced any difficulty during accreditation in previous elections can register to vote.\n\nOthers such as registered voters who wish to change their voting locations, and registered voters whose Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) are lost, defaced or damaged can also register to vote.\n\nSpeaking recently, the commission\u2019s chairman, Mahmood Yakubu said the exercise, as stipulated in Section 10 of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution, should be on a continuous basis, but that that has not been constant due to exigencies of resources.\n\nYakubu said the exercise could not commence largely due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, while the exercise would run for over a year until the third quarter of 2022 with emphasis on the Anambra State as a result of its November 6 governorship election.\n\nThe commission has said that the earlier system of voter identification known as the Direct Data Capturing Machine (DDC) would now be replaced by new compact registration devices to serve better purposes during election.\n\nThe new device is known as the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED) and is based on an Android tablet.\n\n\u201cEffective from Monday 28th June 2021, the CVR exercise will commence nationwide and be carried out continuously for over a year until the third quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cHowever, emphasis will initially be on Anambra State where more centres will be established in view of the Governorship election already scheduled for Saturday 6th November 2021,\u201d Yakubu had said.\n\nHowever, unlike in previous registration exercises, there is high expectation among stakeholders and Nigerians that this time around, the commission would put its house in order to avoid a repeat of the lapses which marred the 2018/2019 registration exercise and disenfranchised thousands of eligible Nigerians.\n\nInterestingly, unlike in the past, this time around the commission would be making use of technology, intending voters are expected to start their registration online and complete their biometrics at one of the registration centres nearer to them across Nigeria.\n\nThe use of internet and technology in the registrations have elicited positive reactions among stakeholders and ordinary Nigerians, as there is the general opinion that it would reduce the bottlenecks and procedures involved in obtaining the permanent voters card.\n\nOthers have also expressed the optimism that perhaps, the use of technology, apart from helping to increase the number of registered voters, could also help to check the alarming voter apathy and gradually restore sanity to Nigeria\u2019s electoral system.\n\nExperts say that countries which had adopted online registration have seen significant improvement in the number of registered voters over time. Several eligible voters in Nigeria shunned the last registration exercise because they could not withstand the rigorous process, meaning that more eligible voters than the 30 million announced by INEC would have been captured.\n\n\u201cIt is good that INEC is using technology this time around, I personally could not register last time because it was rigorous and unorganised; you have to wake up by 5am to go and take a number and I could not stand all that,\u201d Funmi Ogun, a banker, said.\n\nAccording to Brookings Institution political scientist Michael McDonald, Arizona online registration increased registration rates for 18 to 24 year-olds from 29 percent to 53percent in 2016 US general election. Equally important, 94percent of online registrants actually vote, compared to 85percent in the old system.\n\nHowever, some stakeholders have advised the INEC to work with political stakeholders across the country to sensitise Nigerians and make the process less stressful for them.\n\nAdeoye Adelaja, a former National Publicity Secretary of Action Democratic Party (ADP), said the lapses noticed in the previous exercise such as under age registration, extortion of eligible Nigerians by some officials of the commission and failure of machines must be addressed.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere were number of issues that marred the previous registration, and there were lots of outcry by Nigerians where some were denied registration. There were also cases where under-aged who are not constitutionally empowered to vote were allowed to register in the Northern part of Nigeria. All of these must be stopped in the new process.\n\n\u201cA case where INEC adhoc staff turned the exercise into business by extorting people before they could register must also be monitored and ensure all these ugly situations do not recur. Adequate machines and manpower must be put in place so that there are few or no complaints from Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI also urge INEC to make sure that all the legal encumbrances around electronic registration must be sorted with the National Assembly, and Electoral Act, data capturing and data storage must be operational and effective.\n\n\u201cThere must be massive publicity for the exercise, so that those who have not registered or those who just attained the voting age of 18 can be mobilised to register for the process.\n\nJames Adeshina, Lagos State chairman of African Action Congress (ACC) and the state coordinator of Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), expressed optimism that Nigerians would turn out in large numbers because they are desirous of change, while his party would mobilise its members for the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the electoral umpire to employ best hands in order to have a better experience this time around. We use this opportunity to call on all members of Inter Party Advisory Council of Nigeria Lagos state chapter (IPAC) to mobilise their members to participate fully in this exercise.\n\n\u201cContinuous Voter Registration (CVR) is an important exercise meant for the registration of citizens who turned 18 years of age after the last registration exercise; or those who for one reason or another could not register in the previous exercises. It\u2019s the constitutional right of every citizen of Nigeria to vote and be voted for,\u201d Adeshina said.\n\n\u201cThe 2010 Electoral Act (as amended) mandates the Commission to carry out CVR nationwide and to make it available to every political party within 60 days. We as a political party are fully aware of CVR exercise and we shall continue to sensitise our members across board to come out and register,\u201d he further said.\n\nSpeaking to BusinessDay on the exercise, Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education, said the commission was working seriously to remove any hitches noticed in the previous exercise, while expressing confidence that the use of technology would improve the process.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission is committed to deepening the use of technology in the electoral process. It is also committed to deeper and robust engagement of the Nigerian people with the electoral process.\n\n\u201cPart of that commitment and engagement manifested in the expansion of voter access to polling units wherein the commission converted existing voting points and voting point settlements to full-fledged polling units and relocated some to un-served and underserved areas.\n\n\u201cAs the country moves closer to the 2023 general election, the commission is offering to the Nigerian people new polling units in addition to the existing 119,973 polling units. Furthermore, as part of its commitment to free, fair and credible elections, the commission will flag off the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to enable those that have attained the age of 18 and those that have never registered to register.\n\n\u201cThe commission will operate a duality of registering voters. Some of the voters will start and complete their registration at the registration centers. Those that are Internet savvy and have access to smart phones and other electronic gadgets can start their registration online and complete their biometrics at one of the registration centres.\u201d\n\nOkoye further said that \u201cThe online voter registration portal is therefore, one developed by INEC to enable voters perform certain activities on their own. It will provide an additional method of registration for those who have access to Internet facilities, thereby reducing the inconveniences of voters and also reduce the number of voters that would have to queue up at our registration centers\u201d.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has asserted that there are no plans to either sack or retrench workers in the state, noting that ongoing reforms in the state\u2019s civil and public service are aimed at improving productivity and service delivery to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the assurance while addressing participants during a stakeholders\u2019 engagement of the Edo State Transition Committee with Permanent Secretaries, Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), Heads of Local Government Administration (HOLGA) and the Judiciary at the New Festival Hall, Government House, Benin City.\n\nHe said though other states across the country are retrenching workers and cutting down the minimum wage as a result of dwindling economic fortunes, his administration will train and strengthen the civil and public service, ensuring that the workforce is equipped with the right tools and skills to compete globally.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to retrench workers or sack anyone, but you must follow the new trends and conform to the new rules and if you can\u2019t cope, you should move out from the service yourself. I will train you to get the desired output from you; we are going to generate more revenue to run our state.\u201d\n\nThe governor warned the workers against cutting corners to favour themselves, and urged them to be committed and stand upright to better the system.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI will see how your pay and allowance can be improved, but I don\u2019t want to see or hear that any one of you is found corrupt, or engaged in corrupt practices; I will not accept that. I have spoken to the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to collaborate with us on this, and also organise training for you people.\n\n\u201cI will bring in experts to train you in your areas of specialization, and make sure that all leakages are blocked to enable us to move our state forward.\n\n\u201cMy administration is determined to make things work the way it should be; the era of who you know is over, it is now the era of what you can offer the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs heads of MDAs, institutions and departments, you should not allow any file to stay in your offices beyond 48 hours.

So to the people of Cross River State, I say stand firm, we are PDP. We are committed, we are resolute, we are a grassroots party and we are sufficiently strong.\n\n\u201cI want to commend the strength and the will of the people who said listen, we are not going. PDP is our party.

          "text": "The presidency has justified what it called a temporary suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, noting that it is part of efforts to prevent the violent consequences usually linked to the spread of fake news and misinformation.\n\nLai Mohammed, minister of information, had announced the \u201cindefinite\u201d suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria on Friday, sparking angry reactions.\n\nThe suspension had come after Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari in which he made reference to Biafra war, while vowing to treat those destroying public facilities in the language they understand.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Saturday, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, said the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is not only because Buhari\u2019s post was deleted, even as he hinted that the ban was temporary.\n\n\u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\n\u201cThe President in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 said \u201cthe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers. This and similar crimes which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities. They cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweet which should have been read in full. The tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact.\u201d\n\nHe explained what Buhari meant by the post on the Civil War experience, adding that with the current security challenges, the federal government needs to take measures to prevent escalation of tensions.\n\n\u201cA terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens. When the President said that they will be treated \u201cin a language they understand,\u201d he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over,\u201d Shehu said.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d",

Rather, we have been restraining our own people who are victims of these atrocities by preaching patience and peace.\n\nHe however regrettably, \u201cour friends and compatriots, leaders of Igbo extraction, have remained dead silent in the face of increasing assault and effort by their own people to stock a nationwide mayhem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason it is, I want to loudly call them out to speak up.

          "text": "\u201cTime for everything \u2013 time to come here for prayer and time to return home after the service.\u2019\u2019 were some of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua\u2019s last memorable words, when he spoke during the Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting on Saturday.\n\nJoshua, Nigerian pastor, televangelist, philanthropist, leader and founder of The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) died Saturday, June 5, 2021 at the age of 57, just seven days to his 58th birthday.\n\nThe actual cause of death had yet to be made known.\n\nPopularly known as Prophet TB Joshua, he was one of the most controversial and \u201cenigmatic\u2019\u2019 Nigerian pastors of our time, especially with his preaching style and records of miracle performances.\n\nJoshua, who was born on June 12, 1963 in Ondo State, Nigeria, reportedly stayed 15 months in his mother\u2019s womb before he was born.\n\nAccording to the SCOAN website, Joshua attended the St. Stephen\u2019s Anglican Primary School (Ikare-Akoko, Nigeria, 1971-1977).\n\nHe had only one year of secondary education before he left to work in a poultry farm.\n\nWhile in school, he was known as \u2018small pastor\u2019 because of his love for the scriptures and gift to predict things that would happen in his community; he was also said to have been the leader of \u2018Scripture Union\u2019 while in school.\n\nHe had taught children at evening classes and done some menial jobs before he had a revelation to set up a ministry while on a 40-day fast.\n\nIn 1987, TB Joshua founded the Synagogue Church of All Nations under the bridge that links Ejigbo and Egbe in Lagos State with just few members.\n\nThe church later grew to have large number of members within and outside Nigeria, Africa and Latin America.\n\nHe later established the Emmanuel TV television station from Lagos which has wide viewership especially as it is on cable TV.\n\nTB Joshua was a known philanthropist and noted for helping the needy and sponsoring persons.\n\n\u2018My People FC\u2019, a football club he started in 2009, was part of his efforts to help the youth and two members of the team, Sani Emmanuel and Ogenyi Onazi, played for Nigeria Golden Eaglets in the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\n\nAlso, three players of the club were sponsored abroad to play professional football for Sweden.\n\nThe WBO International Light Middleweight boxing champion King, Davidson Emenogu, had said that Joshua financially supported him throughout his career .\n\nA man of many clouts, Forbes in 2011 wrote that Joshua was the third-richest pastor in Nigeria with estimated net worth of between $10 million and $15 million.\n\nHe was so popular that the Wikipedia documented his social media presence to be massive with no fewer than 3.5 million fans on Facebook.\n\n\u201cHis YouTube channel, Emmanuel TV, has over one million subscribers.\n\n\u201cHe was the world\u2019s most viewed Christian ministry on the platform before it was suspended.\n\n\u201cHe was described as the \u201cOprah of Evangelism\u201d and \u201cYouTube\u2019s most popular Pastor\u201d.\n\nLike many influential men, TB Joshua was not without controversies.\n\nOn Sept, 12, 2014, a guesthouse collapsed in the SCOAN\u2019s premises in Lagos, killing no fewer than 115 people.\n\nSpeculations continued to trail the circumstances that led to the collapse, with the former Nigerian Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, alleging that \u201cNigeria\u2019s intelligence agencies \u2018blew up\u2019 the building\u2019\u2019.\n\nAlso, his relationship with other clerics was not smooth and it was publicly criticised.\n\nThe public also questioned the miracles that occurred in his church.\n\nYet, TB Joshua, was unperturbed and in a 2006 book, \u201cThe Mirror\u201d, he said: \u201cWhatever I am today is a product of the conviction that victory through Christ Jesus is victory indeed\u201d ; \u201cThe rest is history.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Joshua made impact in education, healthcare, peace and reconciliation, among others.\n\nA Forbes blogger said that it was estimated that Joshua spent $20 million on \u201ceducation, healthcare and rehabilitation programmes for former Niger Delta militants\u201d\n\nHe was receptive to repentant persons who cut across all walks of life including rehabilitation of repentant militants, armed robbers and sex workers who came to the church for \u2018deliverance\u2019.\n\nThe SCOAN has a scholarship programme that sponsors many students in the primary, secondary and even tertiary institutions.\n\nIn 2012, it was widely reported that Joshua sponsored a Nigerian student doing a PhD in the U.K.\n\nHis humanitarian relief involvement was outstanding as Joshua supported efforts in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and April 2016 in Ecuador, where he gave humanitarian aid worth over $500,000.\n\nIn Ecuador, he funded the rebuilding of a rural school destroyed during the earthquake.\n\nJoshua had sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area in Haiti and also instituted a field hospital called \u2018Clinique Emmanuel\u2019.\n\nHe also supported several groups of Nigerian returnees to settle back into the country, following their attempt to travel illegally to Europe.\n\nOne of his most significant reconciliatory efforts was his involvement in the meeting of the family of the late President of Liberia, Samuel Doe, with the former warlord Yormie Johnson, who was responsible for Doe\u2019s death.\n\nThe Nigerian government in recognition of his humanitarian activities, gave him a National Honour, Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) in 2008.\n\nThe United Nations also gave him a letter of appreciation.\n\nThe Arewa Youth Forum, predominantly Muslim organisation, recognised him as Ambassador of Peace.\n\nZAKA, Israel\u2019s primary rescue and recovery voluntary service, gave him an \u2018award of excellence\u2019 .\n\nUntil his death on Saturday after one of his evening services, Joshua was married to Evelyn Joshua and had three children.\n\nProphet TB Joshua\u2019s last words in public were : \u201cWatch and pray.\u201d \u201cOne life for Christ is all we have; one life for Christ is so dear\u201d.\n\nMr Kunle Olowoopejo, the Executive Chairman, Egbe-Idimu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) in Lagos, described TB Joshua as a complete definition of what humanity should be.\n\nAccording to him, he was generous and no matter your colour, ethnic, tribe, language or religion you may belong to, his hands of fellowship has no bound and that\u2019s why both young and old keep echoing \u201cAlaanu Mekunnu lo (helper of the poor).\u201d\n\nAccording to the Synagogue church, Prophet TB Joshua left legacy of service and sacrifice to God\u2019s Kingdom of which will continue to live on for generations yet unborn.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nA Nigerian group has asked the Commonwealth to apply its charter to hold the Buhari government to account over the suspension of Twitter.\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) sent the urgent appeal to Patricia Scotland, secretary-general of the Commonwealth.\n\nSERAP said Buhari\u2019s action amounted to an abrogation and repression of human rights particularly the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, as well as flagrant disregard for the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe organization asked Scotland to urgently consider recommending the suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth to the Heads of Government and to push the Buhari government to take concrete measures to respect and promote the Commonwealth\u2019s values of human rights, transparency, accountability and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nSERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare signed the appeal dated 5 June, 2021.\n\nThe organization said: \u201cThe Nigerian government has repeatedly demonstrated that it is not committed to protecting human rights. The Commonwealth should take a clear stand to ensure accountability of institutions, freedom of expression and access to information in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians can only freely participate in the democratic processes and shape the society in which they live if these fundamental human rights are fully and effectively respected, protected and promoted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension has the character of collective punishment and is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution and the country\u2019s international obligations. Nigerian authorities would seem to be suppressing people\u2019s access to Twitter to exploit the shutdown to cover up allegations of corruption, abuses, and restrict freedom of expression and other fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nThe appeal was sent to Mr Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations and Ms Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nIt read in part: \u201cThe Nigerian government has also called for the prosecution of those who violate its order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria. This order for prosecution of Twitter users violates the legal rule that there should be no punishment without law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) is a fundamental part of Nigerian constitutional jurisprudence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth Charter recognises the right of individuals to participate in democratic processes, in particular through peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression and access to information, which apply both offline and online.\u201d\n\n\u201cRespect for Commonwealth values is essential for citizens to trust Commonwealth institutions. The Commonwealth ought to take a strong stand for protection of human rights, transparency and the rule of law in Nigeria, principles which are fundamental to the Commonwealth\u2019s integrity, functioning and effectiveness of its institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing citizens to freely exercise their human rights including freedom of expression and access to information without threat of reprisal or prosecution would enable them to contribute to society on issues of transparency, accountability, good governance, integrity and human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian government has a legal responsibility under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and international human rights treaties including the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to respect, protect and promote freedom of expression, access to information, and to ensure a safe and enabling environment for people to enjoy these rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter in Nigeria demonstrates the authorities\u2019 determination to suppress all forms of peaceful dissent by the Nigerian people. There are well-founded fears that the human rights situation in Nigeria will deteriorate even further if urgent action is not taken to address it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, the Nigerian government on Friday 4 June, 2021 unlawfully ordered all internet service providers to suspend Twitter in Nigeria. The suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria followed the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets, which according to Twitter \u2018violated the Twitter Rules.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is taking place against the background of repression of the civic space and harassment of media houses, and journalists who are targeted simply for performing their professional duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter has seriously undermined transparency and accountability in government. The lack of transparency undermines the rule of law and Nigerians\u2019 ability to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cLack of transparency and accountability, and the absence of the rule of law in Nigeria have contributed hugely to denying Nigerians their fundamental human rights. People have been targeted simply for using Twitter and peacefully exercising their fundamental human rights.\u201d",

          "text": "More than 20 people have been allegedly killed in Igangan, one of the towns in Ibarapa North local government, as gunmen opened fire last night.\n\nThe Palace of the Asigangan as well as a popular petroleum station were not spared. They were razed by the suspected bandits numbering 50, who were said to have invaded the town around 11 pm in more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nThis is coming few days after the chairman Oyo State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, General Kunle Togun (rtd) alleged that foreign Fulanis have encamped the entire Southwest region and may strike if nothing is done urgently.\n\nA former caretaker chairman of the council, Tunji Omolewu, who confirmed last night\u2019s incident said he had to rush down around 5 am this morning.\n\n\u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11 pm. We were on our way from Ekiti where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally. I got to Ibadan around 12 am and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. I have counted more than 20 dead bodies. The palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station too was burnt. We are assembled here\u2026\u201d he said, almost breaking down in tears.\n\nA former caretaker chairman of neighbouring Ibarapa Central, Yemi Akinlabi, who is holidaying in the United States, said his phone was bombarded with calls.\n\n\u201dIt is so sad. Only few days ago, our people got intelligence report and forwarded it to the appropriate quarters for actions but here we are today. Are we going to continue to live in fear in our land? I have spoken to General Toogun about last night\u2019s incident and we would want him and his team to do something. Our people must not be allowed to resort to self-help,\u201d he added.\n\nOnly last Wednesday, during the tour of project to mark his two years in office, Governor Seyi Makinde had disclosed that insecurity in Ibarapaland has been the most challenging and that his government has put in place several measures, including the creation of a Base for Operation Burst in the area and deployment of more Amotekun corps, among others.\n\nHe said that these measures have yielded positive results in the last few months.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted Makinde as saying that in order to tackle the security challenge, the government is about to recruit more Amotekun corps, adding that it would also take a decision on what to do with the uncompleted 60-bed health facility in Igangan, which has become a hideout for criminals.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe issue of insecurity brought me here the last time and I remember that I made a comment that we needed to tackle those challenges because it is the only way it can affect our economic prosperity. Farmers in Ibarapa could not freely go to their farms because cows are invading their farms.\n\n\u201cIt is a problem that has been existing even before we came into government, and one of the promises I made then was to tackle security challenges. And the question to take home is \u2013 can anybody here imagine Oyo State without Amotekun? It is one of the initiatives we brought forward. Before we came, there was nothing like that. Yes, there may still be few areas we need to improve on but we all should work together with Amotekun.\n\n\u201cWell, since the last time we came here and now, we have taken various steps to ensure that the people of Ibarapaland and, indeed, the whole of Oyo State sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cIbarapaland is the most challenging zone as far as security is concerned. Since the last time I came here and now, there has been relative progress but we will do more. We will strengthen security. Between the last time I came and now, we have set up Operation Burst base and we are in the process of recruiting more Amotekun personnel.\n\n\u201cBut I want to appeal to you not to leave the government alone to face the issue of insecurity, as we all need to join hands to make things work. That is the only way; we have to keep moving together, because the government alone cannot do it. We expect you to work with us and the security agencies.\u201d\n\nIgangan, a-177 kilometer town away from Ibadan, the state capital, had come to limelight, though for bad reason, following last December\u2019s murder of politician and large-scale farmer, Dr. Fatai Aborode, a large-scale farmer, by persons whom his farm manager told PREMIUM TIMES he could identify as Fulani.\n\nIt took the intervention of Sunday Adeyemo, before normalcy could return to the town.

The Commonwealth should take a clear stand to ensure accountability of institutions, freedom of expression and access to information in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cNigerians can only freely participate in the democratic processes and shape the society in which they live if these fundamental human rights are fully and effectively-respected, protected, and promoted.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Didn\u2019t \u2018Temporarily\u2019 Ban Twitter Just For Deleting Buhari\u2019s Tweets \u2013 Presidency\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe suspension has the character of collective punishment and is antithetical to the Nigerian Constitution and the country\u2019s international obligations. Nigerian authorities would seem to be suppressing people\u2019s access to Twitter to exploit the shutdown to cover up allegations of corruption, abuses, and restrict freedom of expression and other fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nThe Urgent Appeal, copied to Mr. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations; and Ms. Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, read in part: \u201cThe Nigerian government has also called for the prosecution of those who violate its order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria. This order for the prosecution of Twitter users violates the legal rule that there should be no punishment without law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) is a fundamental part of Nigerian constitutional jurisprudence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth Charter recognises the right of individuals to participate in democratic processes, in particular through peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression and access to information, which apply both offline and online.\u201d\n\n\u201cRespect for Commonwealth values is essential for citizens to trust Commonwealth institutions. The Commonwealth ought to take a strong stand for the protection of human rights, transparency, and the rule of law in Nigeria, principles which are fundamental to the Commonwealth\u2019s integrity, functioning, and effectiveness of its institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing citizens to freely exercise their human rights including freedom of expression and access to information without threat of reprisal or prosecution would enable them to contribute to society on issues of transparency, accountability, good governance, integrity, and human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian government has a legal responsibility under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and international human rights treaties including the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to respect, protect and promote freedom of expression, access to information, and to ensure a safe and enabling environment for people to enjoy these rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter in Nigeria demonstrates the authorities\u2019 determination to suppress all forms of peaceful dissent by the Nigerian people. There are well-founded fears that the human rights situation in Nigeria will deteriorate even further if urgent action is not taken to address it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, the Nigerian government on Friday 4 June, 2021 unlawfully ordered all internet service providers to suspend Twitter in Nigeria. The suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria followed the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets, which according to Twitter \u2018violated the Twitter Rules.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is taking place against the background of repression of the civic space and harassment of media houses, and journalists who are targeted simply for performing their professional duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter has seriously undermined transparency and accountability in government. The lack of transparency undermines the rule of law and Nigerians\u2019 ability to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cLack of transparency and accountability, and the absence of the rule of law in Nigeria have contributed hugely to denying Nigerians their fundamental human rights. People have been targeted simply for using Twitter and peacefully exercising their fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged the Commonwealth to:\n\n1. Publicly condemn the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and put pressure on the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to reverse the unlawful suspension;\n\n2. Urge the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to respect freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom, as well as promote transparency and accountability, and the rule of law;\n\n3. Urge the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw the threat to prosecute Nigerians simply for peacefully exercising their rights through Twitter\n\n4. Establish a mechanism to visit Nigeria to monitor and report on violations of Nigerians\u2019 right to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, absence of transparency and accountability, and persistent disregard for the rule of law, and to get to the root of the facts and circumstances of such abuses, with a view to ensuring full accountability. Such mechanism would be the right response from the Commonwealth to protect the integrity of the institutions and ensure compliance by members to the Commonwealth values as enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and declarations",

The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire. Now, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war.

          "text": "Gunmen have killed at least 132 people in Burkina Faso\u2019s volatile north, the government said, as the United Nations chief condemned \u201cthe heinous attack\u201d and called on countries to step up the fight against \u201cviolent extremism\u201d.\n\nThe assailants struck during the night on Friday, killing residents of the village of Solhan in Yagha province, which borders Niger. They also burned homes and the village market, according to a government statement on Saturday.\n\nThe victims included seven children. Another 40 residents were also wounded, government spokesman Ousseni Tamboura told reporters.\n\nPresident Roch Marc Christian Kabore called the killings \u201cbarbaric\u201d and said the Burkinabe people \u201cmust remain united and solid against these obscurantist forces\u201d.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility so far.\n\nThe overnight assault was the deadliest recorded in years in Burkina Faso.\n\nSince 2015, the West African country has struggled to fight back against increasingly frequent and deadly attacks from groups linked to al-Qaeda and more recently to ISIL (ISIS). The attacks first started in the north near the Mali border, but have since spread to other regions, particularly in the east, causing one of the world\u2019s most acute humanitarian crises.\n\nSome 1.2 million people in Burkina Faso have been forced to flee their homes because of the long-running conflict, as armed groups step up attacks on the army and civilians despite the presence of thousands of French troops and other international and regional forces across the Sahel.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the killings in Burkina Faso and offered the country the world body\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d.\n\nGuterres \u201cstrongly condemns the heinous attack and underscores the urgent need for the international community to redouble support to Member States in the fight against violent extremism and its unacceptable human toll,\u201d his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.\n\nBurkina Faso has now declared 72 hours of mourning in the country.\n\nIn Solhan, a local source told AFP the assailants stuck at approximately 2am against a position of the Volunteers for the Defence of the Motherland (VDP), a civilian defence force that backs the national army.\n\nThey then attacked homes and carried out \u201cexecutions,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe VDP was set up in December 2019 to help Burkina Faso\u2019s poorly equipped military fight against armed groups, but it has suffered more than 200 fatalities, according to an AFP tally. The volunteers are only given two weeks of military training before deploying to work alongside the security forces. They typically carry out surveillance, information-gathering or escort duties.\n\nCorrine Dufka, the Human Rights Watch\u2019s West Africa director, said the Solhan attack followed a familiar pattern seen elsewhere in the Sahel this year.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic is the [armed groups] come in, they overpower the civil defence post and engage in collective punishment against the rest of the village,\u201d Dufka said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern we\u2019ve seen everywhere this year.\u201d\n\nFor instance, in neighbouring Niger, armed attackers killed 137 people in March in what analysts and rights groups said could have been revenge for killings by self-defence groups in the area or for the arrests of people suspected of belonging to armed groups.\n\nDufka said Friday\u2019s attack pushes the number of people killed by armed groups in the Sahel region since January to more than 500. Most of the killings were carried out by fighters with the Islamic State of the Greater Sahara, she added.\n\nThe attack in Solhan came just weeks after defence minister Cheriff Sy and other military top brass visited the neighbouring town of Sebba to assure people that life had returned to normal, following a number of military operations in the area, according to Al Jazeera\u2019s Nicolas Haque.\n\n\u201cThere was also a military barracks not far away from where the attack took place,\u201d said Haque. \u201cBut they did not react. They never arrived on the scene. It\u2019s a feeling that people across the Sahel now share in \u2013 that they cannot rely on their security forces to protect them.\u201d\n\nWith the security situation deteriorating, analysts have said more violent attacks were likely to follow in Burkina Faso and neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cIt is an awful massacre that\u2019s happened. And I\u2019m afraid we are going to have to expect more similar types of reports,\u201d said Alex Vines, director of the Africa Programme at the international think-tank, Chatham House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hotspot. It\u2019s that tri-border area of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, where there\u2019s very significant displacement and violence taking place \u2026 The governments are increasingly weak and ineffective. And they are not providing the security that populations need. And so armed groups \u2026 are filling those gaps.\u201d\n\nVines told Al Jazeera the uptick in violence in the Sahel has other West African countries worried.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very serious and it is spreading regionally. This isn\u2019t just about the Sahel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are overspill security incidents now, in countries along the Gulf of Guinea coast. So, think Benin, think Togo. The Ghanaians are particularly worried about what\u2019s happening along their border with Burkina Faso. Ivory Coast, also. This is becoming increasingly an international issue.\u201d",

          "text": "Roger Federer says he may pull out of the French Open if there is too much risk to his knee, and to his Wimbledon prospects, from playing on.\n\nThe Swiss beat Dominik Koepfer over three-and-a-half hours late on Saturday in only his sixth match since having double knee surgery.\n\nFederer, 39, is due to play Matteo Berrettini in the last 16 on Monday.\n\nBut he said he will decide later on Sunday whether now would be the \u201cperfect time to take a rest\u201d.\n\nThe 20-time Grand Slam champion lacked fluency and trust in his game before coming through to beat Germany\u2019s Koepfer 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 at a near-empty Roland Garros.\n\nEighth seed Federer is playing in only his third tournament since January 2020 and says he is using it to build up fitness for Wimbledon, which starts on his favoured grass surface at the end of June.\n\n\u201cWe go through these matches, we analyse them highly and look on what\u2019s next,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will do the same here on Sunday, because I need to decide if I keep on playing or not. Is it not too much risk at this moment to keep on pushing or is this just a perfect way to just take a rest?\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s ninth seed Berrettini, 25, reached the fourth round at Roland Garros for the first time with a 7-6 (8-6) 6-3 6-4 win over South Korea\u2019s Kwon Soon-woo.\n\nAfter hitting 52 winners against Kwon to continue a fine clay-court season, Madrid runner-up Berrettini will be widely considered the favourite against 2009 champion Federer.\n\nFederer increasingly struggled against Koepfer, ranked 59th in the world, in a gruelling contest that lacked quality and was played in a soulless atmosphere without fans.\n\nIn a lengthy opening set, Federer was unable to clinch any of five break points \u2013 including a set point in the 10th game \u2013 before an untimely double fault from Koepfer helped the Swiss to nick the tie-break.\n\nThe ruthless edge appeared, eventually, in the opening game of the second set when Federer whipped a crosscourt forehand past Koepfer to convert his third break point.\n\nLittle separated the pair, who traded three more breaks in a row, during another close and cumbersome set. The solid Koepfer was able to draw unforced errors out of the erratic Federer, who also struggled with his usually reliable serve.\n\nFederer\u2019s demeanour became increasingly despondent after Koepfer broke in the first game of the third set and he looked to be waning physically as the German remained in control.\n\nSomehow, the Swiss shifted the momentum back in his favour out of nowhere with a break back in the eighth game and, after missing a set point in the 12th, took the third tie-break.\n\nThe fourth set looked destined for another tie-break before Federer dug deep to pick up his level and win the final three games for victory.\n\nBut there were no fans to celebrate the moment, which seemed particularly stark when it was a player who has entertained packed stadiums for so many years.\n\n\u201cThere are still a few people here, I don\u2019t know who they are: sponsors, journalists, my team too,\u201d Federer said.\n\n\u201cI love tennis, I like to play. I might have been more nervous if the stadium had been full.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, the French Open has introduced daily night sessions, which consist of one match starting at 9pm local time under the floodlights on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThat meant the third set did not start until shortly after 11pm, the match eventually finishing not long before 1am, and left many tennis fans on social media platforms wondering who actually benefited from the late scheduling.\n\nNo fans were present on court because of the 9pm curfew imposed by the French government as part of coronavirus restrictions.\n\n\u201cI think these night matches start too late,\u201d former British number one Laura Robson said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\u201cThey have got a very quick turnaround before their next match, probably get back to the their hotel between 2am and 3am, then have to reset.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy, especially when your next opponent has long been and gone.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine this is what Federer was expecting when he walked out on the court, to be there so late. It is one other thing to worry about. Less recovery time and less sleep, with Berrettini to come.\u201d\n\nOnly one of the six night matches so far have been a women\u2019s match \u2013 Serena Williams\u2019 opener against Irina-Camelia Begu on Monday \u2013 and it would be optimistic to think a men\u2019s match would only last two hours, making late finishes inevitable.\n\nIt was a match that will live long in the memory, although not always for the right reasons.\n\nRoger Federer is not supposed to play like this \u2013 even though this was just his sixth match in the past 16 months.\n\nThere was little fluency, and some horrible errors. But in his 40th year, and at nearly a quarter to one on a Sunday morning in a soulless and empty stadium, Federer still found the key to victory.\n\nNight sessions are here to stay. They will look and sound great in years to come \u2013 as long as they don\u2019t start as late as 9pm.\n\nBut they are absolutely no fun when there is a curfew in town.",

          "title": "In Boost for Africa, Senegal to Make Covid Shots Next Year",
          "text": "Senegal could begin producing COVID-19 vaccines next year under an agreement with Belgian biotech group Univercells aimed at boosting Africa\u2019s drug-manufacturing ambitions, a source involved in funding the project told Reuters.\n\nAs wealthy countries begin to reopen after securing vaccine supplies early, African nations are still struggling to acquire shots. On a continent of 1.3 billion, only about 7 million have been fully vaccinated.\n\nThe collaboration highlights the opportunities created by a global push to channel money and technology towards production on a continent that makes only 1% of the vaccines it requires.\n\nUnivercells announced the signing of a letter of intent for collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Senegal\u2019s capital Dakar in April. The source shared details of the proposal, which were not made public.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Institut Pasteur would use vaccine production technology developed by Univercells to supply COVID-19 vaccine shots to countries across West Africa.\n\nThe institute would initially begin packaging and distributing vaccines produced by Univercells in Belgium early next year, the source involved in securing financing for the collaboration told Reuters.\n\nUnivercells would transfer its full production line to Senegal in the second half of 2022, the source said, adding that the company would train local staff so they could eventually run the operation.\n\nUnivercells chief investment officer Kate Antrobus, when asked about the timeframe for the project, confirmed that it could send vaccine doses to Senegal early next year.\n\nShe declined to comment on the exact date for a full vaccine production line in Senegal but of the timelines referenced she said: \u201cI do not think they are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nTiming depends on Univercells securing regulatory approval for a vaccine production site in Belgium. Antrobus said that was expected \u201cany day now\u201d.\n\nInstitut Pasteur director Amadou Sall declined to comment on the timeline or size of the project but said the facility was working with donors to secure financial backing.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of political will, I am optimistic. But it is not about momentum, it is about creating a real opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is not clear yet what vaccine will be supplied to Senegal, but Antrobus said the site in Belgium would be able to manufacture a class of so-called viral vector COVID-19 vaccine such as those developed by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), AstraZeneca (AZN.L), Russia\u2019s Sputnik V and China\u2019s Cansino.\n\n\u201cIf COVID amazingly subsides over the next year\u2026.that same capacity could be used for other viruses,\u201d Antrobus said.\n\nUnivercells also has its own COVID-19 vaccine candidate, being developed with Germany\u2019s Leukocare and Italian firm ReiThera, which has completed Phase II trials. It is seeking financing to carry out Phase III, which the Italian government said it is ready to fund.\n\nSenegal\u2019s Institut Pasteur is the only facility in Africa currently producing a vaccine \u2013 a yellow fever shot \u2013 that is pre-qualified by the World Health Organization, which requires manufacturers to meet strict international standards.\n\nPre-qualification allows facilities to supply to major buyers like the U.N. children\u2019s agency UNICEF.\n\nDonors including the United States and the European Union are lining up to help fund an expansion at the institute to incorporate COVID-19 vaccines, the source involved in fundraising said.\n\nA call by the institute for an initial $10 million in funding has been oversubscribed, the source said.\n\nA U.K. government-funded cost analysis conducted for the Institut Pasteur, seen by the same source, said that the project would cost about $200 million, based on its aim to produce 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine by the end of next year.\n\nFinancing will depend on the institute having committed buyers. According to the cost analysis, the project would be commercially viable if it produced vaccines other than COVID-19, so it can keep functioning after the pandemic.\n\nSTRATEGIC PLAN\n\nAfrica\u2019s struggles to secure vaccine supplies exposed its vulnerability to health crises and pushed governments to find ways to boost medicine and vaccine production.\n\nThose efforts are now gaining traction with wealthy countries.\n\nThe European Union said last month that it will invest at least 1 billion euros to build manufacturing hubs in Africa, with Senegal, South Africa, Rwanda, Morocco and Egypt among the leading candidates.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Biovac Institute told Reuters it has been in touch with the French and German governments and pharmaceutical companies with an aim to produce 30 million COVID-19 vaccines annually.\n\nSouth African company, Aspen Pharmacare, is already producing shots of the J&J vaccine locally.\n\nThe EU plan, in coordination with the African Union, aims to bolster drugs regulators in Africa, train Africans in the skills needed to expand the pharmaceuticals industry, and support businesses producing materials and components.\n\nThe plan will look at countries that \u201ccan move quickly, and which have the political capital to drag that forward,\u201d John Nkengasong, director of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said.\n\nAfrica\u2019s $1.3 billion vaccine market could rise to as high as $5.4 billion by 2030 because of population growth and the availability of new vaccines, U.S.-based consultancy McKinsey and Company said in an April report.\n\nThere is still a long way to go, experts say.\n\nBeyond the need for financing, governments and regulators need to make it easier for technology to be transferred to Africa, and to reduce risk through public-private partnerships.\n\n\u201cThese are really mid to long-term goals, so you\u2019re looking at one to two years minimum,\u201d said Chema Triki of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about COVID. Africa needs to be ready for the next pandemic.\u201d",
          "summary": "Under the agreement, the Institut Pasteur would use vaccine production technology developed by Univercells to supply COVID-19 vaccine shots to countries across West Africa.\nShe declined to comment on the exact date for a full vaccine production line in Senegal but of the timelines referenced she said: \u201cI do not think they are unreasonable.\u201dTiming depends on Univercells securing regulatory approval for a vaccine production site in Belgium.\nUnivercells also has its own COVID-19 vaccine candidate, being developed with Germany\u2019s Leukocare and Italian firm ReiThera, which has completed Phase II trials.\nSTRATEGIC PLANAfrica\u2019s struggles to secure vaccine supplies exposed its vulnerability to health crises and pushed governments to find ways to boost medicine and vaccine production.\nThe European Union said last month that it will invest at least 1 billion euros to build manufacturing hubs in Africa, with Senegal, South Africa, Rwanda, Morocco and Egypt among the leading candidates.",
