          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nThe National Coordinator, National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Buruli Ulcer Control Programme, Dr.Chukwuma Anyaike, has cautioned that it is dangerous for humans to have sex with animals\n\nHe warns that there are diseases that are peculiar to animals, noting that humans should avoid getting infected with such infections.\n\nThe expert noted that these diseases can become a major health challenge when contracted by humans.\n\nDr. Anyaike, who is a Consultant Public Health Physician, also stressed that some sexually transmitted diseases in animals like dogs can become very difficult to treat when contracted by humans.\n\nBesides the risk of contracting STDs, the physician said people who have sex with dogs are at risk of transmissible diseases such as rabies, skin diseases and ringworms.\n\nThe physician was reacting to a viral video of a lady claiming to have made N1.7m from sleeping with a dog in an exclusive interview with PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nThe slim, light-skinned lady in the video said there was no big deal about engaging in bestiality.\n\nHowever, while condemning the act, Dr. Anyaike told our correspondent that everything was wrong with bestiality, stressing that having sex with an animal comes with serious health consequences.\n\nThe physician said, \u201cAny disease can come out from an animal and it can enter into a man. When it enters into man, then we start struggling with another evolution and how to take care of it. Coronavirus and Avian Influenza come from animals.\n\n\u201cAny disease that is common in an animal can come to man and if it comes to man, it becomes another evolution because it is not common to man.\n\n\u201cA disease that is common in animals, they have a way of growing with it but when it comes to man, it becomes another problem.\n\n\u201cSome of the STDs in animals when they come to man, they are difficult to treat.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, some diseases are peculiar to animals and some are peculiar to man.\n\nDr. Anyaike, said, \u201cApart from other transmissible diseases from dogs such as rabies, skin diseases including ringworms (fungal infection) there are three common canine STDs.\n\n\u201cThese are also zoonotic meaning that they can be transmitted from animals to man.\n\n\u201cFirst is Canine Brucellosis. Brucellosis is a disease caused by a bacterium, Brucella canis.\n\n\u201cIt is found throughout the world. It is spread through contact with aborted foetuses and discharges from the uterus of an infected dog during mating, through maternal milk, and possibly through airborne transmission in some cases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that Canine Brucellosis can be spread to humans. Brucellosis can lead to liver disease and arthritis. Brucellosis is very difficult to treat successfully.\u201d\n\nThe physician also identified Canine Herpesvirus as another common STD that humans could get from dogs.\n\nAccording to him, it is a condition that spreads through mucus in the mouth and nose of the dog.\n\nHe noted that biting, licking and sniffing are additional ways the canine sexually transmitted disease spreads.\n\nDr. Anyaike also listed Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumors or CTVT as another disease that can be contracted by a human who has sex with a dog, adding that it is a sexually transmitted cancer.\n\n\u201cIt can also spread through biting, licking and sniffing the penile or vaginal areas. Treatment involves chemotherapy or radiation.\n\n\u201cChemotherapy for the sexually transmitted disease is the first option, and if that fails to work, radiation will be used,\u201d he said.\n\nSuggesting the way forward, the physician said the principle of One Health should always be borne \u2018in our minds\u2019 to avoid emerging infectious diseases that may become pandemic.\n\n\u201cOne Health is defined as a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach \u2014 working at the local, regional, national, and global levels \u2014 with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes by recognising the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to lawyers, the Criminal Code Act and the Penal Code Act criminalise sleeping with an animal.\n\nAccording to the lawyers, it is a crime that attracts up to 14 years imprisonment in Nigeria.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

There is no leader that is not confronted with his own or her own problems.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201dMr President, this particular Ramadan has been a very good one, especially during the period of the fast. Of course, because of the prayers and the blessings that many of the faithful would have received, but it also coincided with the lent season, it meant that at the same time, Christians and Muslims were fasting.\n\n\u201dThe one big advantage of that, Mr President, as you know, is that our FEC meetings were much shorter, and the reason why our FEC meetings were shorter, Mr President, as you know, is that all the trouble-makers who argue too much were all too hungry to make any arguments! (General laughter)\n\n\u201dSo, Mr President, we must continue to pray that future Ramadan will coincide with lent so that, at least, we will have some peace at FEC meetings! (General laughter)\n\n\u201dMr President, we really want to thank God for our nation, and I think that this is a perfect opportunity to thank God for our nation, that our nation is together and united. Every generation of leaders is confronted with its own problems. There is no leader that is not confronted with his own or her own problems.\n\n\u201dOur government has been confronted with problems. COVID-19, for example, was a problem that nobody ever expected, it took two years of the life of the government and the life of the economy as well.\n\n\u201dWe also have insecurity here and there, but it is in the very nature of God to provide everything that is required by the leadership to surmount the challenges that it faces. God will not give us any challenge that is beyond us.\n\n\u201dI want to just thank the Almighty God, for giving you, Mr President, all that you have required to tackle these challenges and for giving you the life and strength to tackle the challenges and surmount the challenges. I pray that the Almighty God will continually help you and help our government to tackle every one of the various challenges as we confront them.\u201d",

          "text": "In the pantheon of current politicians in Nigeria, the most successful of them all seem to come from generous families with deep pockets and family trust funds. Or do they?\n\nAhead of the country\u2019s 2023 general elections, both of Nigeria\u2019s leading parties \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP \u2013 have placed the country at the disposal of these generously monied political specimens, who are ready to go bidding for the rights to bring the country under the control of their non-existent family trusts of unknown provenance.\n\nTo advance their case for the rights to run Nigeria as part of these wholly-owned family charities, these scions of unknown money are spending the generosity of their apocryphal family trusts with the enthusiasms of the mythical drunken sailor. That apparently is the new dialect of political entitlement.\n\nOne of them, for example, the sole owner of a piece of political real estate that also doubles as a federating unit, has been spraying money around the country. By some coincidence, he happens unashamedly to covet the presidency of Nigeria as his \u201clifelong ambition\u201d.\n\nIn Katsina, President Buhari\u2019s home state, last month, he sprayed N50 million Naira from his family trust funds for the benefit, it was said, of victims of a market fire disaster. Impressively, all this money was given not to a representative of the victims of the fire or of the market union but to the state governor who happens to determine most of the delegates of the ruling party in the contest for its presidential ticket.\n\nTwo weeks later, the same man was in Kaduna, where, as in Katsina, he also gave N50 million from his generous family trust funds to the state governor for the victims of the terrorist attack on the train that took place on March 28. It did not matter that this act of uncommon generosity took place while most of the victims were still in captivity nor did he much show any interest in or ask how they could be freed. None of that was going to stand in the way of dispensing the generosity authorised by the family trust.\n\nIn Kano, the most populous state in Northern Nigeria, this past week, this family trust has distributed lorry loads of branded bags of stomach infrastructure with instructions for these to be shared with party delegates ahead of the Eid celebrations.\n\nOn the day of the presidential election in February 2019, by the way, the same family trust released funds in bullion vans in Lagos which financed unknown operations on election day.\n\nContemporaneously in the opposition party, another family trust from the Niger Delta has unlocked its vaults for its favourite son, who just happens by accident to have designs on the presidency in 2023.\n\nHe goes around the country in a private jet the family\u2019s generosity to dispense. When a fire gutted the Sokoto Central Market in January 2021, he flew into the state with N500 million for the state government to rebuild the market.\n\nWhen he visited Kaduna State in the third week of April, he made the state government richer by N200 million from the family trust for the care of victims of the same train attack who are still captives of their abductors. That sum, by the way, was four times more than the Governors Forum gave.\n\nFor his visit to Anambra State in South-East Nigeria, the family trust unlocked access to its domiciliary account and, by the time he left the state, the party delegates were enthusiastically back-slapping one another as they danced in a dollar rain.\n\nThese people traversing the country with truckloads of Ghana-Must-Go bags full of mint-fresh notes from non-existent but generous family trusts do not pretend to be interested in ensuring that their rain of supposedly charitable money achieves any public good. In comparison, when he raised N250 million for orphanages in Nigeria in the last quarter of 2021, award-winning singer, David Adeleke, constituted a process to ensure the selection of beneficiaries and effective administration of the resources. He even provided a full report to the public when all that was done.\n\nThe amount of money being dispensed in the name of these unknown family trusts endowed by unknown parents with unknowable wealth is stupefying. Their unconcealed interest is in hoovering up delegates for the presidential primaries. Meanwhile, the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB; Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC; Independent Corrupt Practices Commission, ICPC; the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, and other sundry institutions of financial integrity and anti-corruption all appear to be happy clappers, enjoying these scenes of financial crime with unadulterated admiration, occasionally distracted by the whiff of ladies\u2019 intimate fabrics.\n\nDespite the less-than-sanguine reputation of its politics, Nigeria\u2019s elected leaders until now have not exactly been famous for the depth of their pockets or their contrived political philanthropy. Today, by contrast, Nigeria appears to produce only unknown family trusts and to consume their politics that neither feeds the stomach nor nourishes the country.\n\nPolitical parties are supposed to chaperone competition for access to the mandate to superintend the public good. In Nigeria right now, they conduct auctions to buy and sell the country.\n\nHow we got here is a story for another time and the story of how the country corrupted politics and politicised corruption is too well known to bear undue repetition here. What is clear is that by the time he left office in 2007, President Obasanjo who was, reportedly, barely saved from bankruptcy when he returned from prison in 1998 before running for the presidency in 1999, had become a billionaire. Since then, party politics has established itself as an assured path to quick and stupendous wealth.\n\nIt was not always so. In the First Republic, there was clear water between money and power. Nigeria\u2019s richest, like Sanusi Dantata, Louis Odumegwu-Ojukwu and Adeola Odutola were businessmen who were not much interested in controlling party politics or running for office, even if they had their own sympathies. Abubakar Tafawa-Balewa, the country\u2019s Prime Minister at Independence, barely could afford a house. Ahmadu Bello, Obafemi Awolowo and Nnamdi Azikiwe were interested in power, made a lot of names and did not appear to care about making a lot of money for themselves.\n\nShehu Shagari, who was elected Nigeria\u2019s president in 1979, was not exactly anyone\u2019s idea of a rich man. Dissolute as his administration was in parts, no one seriously accused Shagari of personal corruption or money-making.\n\nWhen, 40 years ago, billionaire businessman, Moshood Abiola, went about dispensing his money with the aim of unsettling the political fortunes of the ruling National Party of Nigeria, NPN, of President Shagari, Umaru Dikko, the Transport Minister and unofficial party enforcer, infamously advised him with dry brutality that \u201cthe presidency is not for sale\u201d. In a huff, Abiola stormed off the ruling party, his presidential ambitions in ruins and, ultimately, deferred until after eternity. It was immaterial that at the time the Chairman of the NPN was, like Abiola, another Yoruba man, Augustus Meredith Akinloye.\n\nIn 1965, Time Magazine celebrated the industry of Nigeria\u2019s millionaires, writing that they \u201cmade their money by competing with the White man for his trade\u201d. In their place, Nigeria\u2019s trillionaires today occupy the inner sanctums of power or parade their corridors, perpetrating state plunder and spoliation in a shameless state capture enterprise with an official imprimatur.\n\nThe same Time Magazine story from 58 years ago quotes Adeola Odutola as having proudly boasted that \u201c[t]he time is coming when we will produce more than we can consume and we will have to look outside Nigeria for markets\u201d. Today, Nigeria produces politicians who in turn make nothing. The citizens consume stomach infrastructure, and the money goes to the auctioneers who are happy to knock the country down to the highest bidder.\n\nWe may pretend about it, but we know their money is criminal and their \u201cdonations\u201d are low-grade racketeering. They are too lazy to do politics and have taken to plunder in order to pay their way at the auction of Nigeria. That is the new normal and the real crime is that these crimes are committed under cover of impunity and immunity from those who should bring them to an end.\n\n*A lawyer and a teacher, Odinkalu can be reached at [email protected]\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ,BMGF, Bill Gates, recently had a Pan-Africa Roundtable Press Conference with selected journalists ahead of the release of his book on pandemic prevention, How to Prevent the Next Pandemic.\n\nJimoh Babatunde here presents an excerpt from the round table where Bill Gates talked about the Covid pandemic, need for Global Epidemic Response , his talk with states in Northern Nigeria on how to improve health systems and how to end malaria in Nigeria among other issues .\n\nMODERATOR: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. Welcome to this roundtable with Bill Gates on his book, How to Prevent the Next Pandemic. My name is Buhle Makamanzi and I\u2019m the moderator. I believe my colleague has gone through the logistics, the embargo details, how to queue up for questions, et cetera, so we\u2019ll just jump straight into the conversation. To say though that there is a lot we could talk about today, but I would like for us to stick to the subject matter, so I\u2019m going to use my moderator privileges to make sure that we stick to the conversation, so that we can have a deep and rich conversation with Bill.\n\nI\u2019ll go straight to my first question which is, next week, your book, How to Prevent the Next Pandemic, will be released. When and why did you decide to write this book?\n\nBILL GATES: Well, the COVID pandemic has been an incredible tragedy, with the costs, and you have economic damage. You have tens and millions of deaths. You have education opportunities lost.\n\nIt\u2019s been a very tough, tough two years. For many countries, they\u2019ve had more deaths than they had for anything since World War II. And so you\u2019d hope that the world would pull together and think, okay, how do we prevent this from happening again.\n\nIf you look across different countries, some did better than others. Australia, for example, has less for example, has less than 10% of the deaths of most of the upper income countries because they acted very quickly. Japan has a lot less deaths because they are one of the best countries at wearing masks in the world.\n\nAnd so we should step back from this incredible tragedy, look at what went well and think through how do we respond quicker? And that\u2019s where the idea of a global team, which I call GERM (Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization) that comes in, and what tools should we have had.\n\nAnd hopefully people don\u2019t forget that, even before the pandemic came, although there\u2019s been incredible progress in reducing health inequity, year after year, the inequities in access to health treatment are pretty stark between developing countries and upper income countries.\n\nThe foundation is one of many organizations that works on that, and sadly, the pandemic has not been an exception to that. But hopefully it reminds people we need to do more, including strengthening health systems.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Bill. But is it too early to start thinking about future outbreaks when we\u2019re still fighting COVID?\n\nBILL GATES: Well, because the world doesn\u2019t have global government, we work through these UN organizations, including the WHO, and the process of adding a new capacity at that level and making sure that it\u2019s well funded and well-run takes time.\n\nI think it\u2019s important for both the research agenda, some of which is going to take 5 to 10 years for that global capacity, which always takes time to get into place and get the right consensus and funding. And for highlighting the inequity, I think while this is still in our mind, that\u2019s when we really ought to have the debate.\n\nAnd so I thought having the book come out with a proposal, some thoughts about what GERM should look like, what the R&D agenda should look like, and a reminder about the central role of health systems \u2013 you know, I thought it was very timely.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely true. This pandemic is not over. New variants will come along. How severe they will be is hard to predict. The entire world has probably 60% to 80% infection, which is mind blowing. And hopefully as variants come along, that means the likelihood of severe sickness and death, that it\u2019s not going to be as acute as it was in these big waves.\n\nWe\u2019re still learning about variants and many of these things I talk about, like getting diagnostic machines up broadly, getting the therapeutics out broadly, those things apply to this pandemic, and we should design a system that\u2019ll work not just for this one, but for the future threats as well.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Bill. What, in your view, needs to happen to bring this pandemic to an end and ensure we never have a repeat of the suffering the world has experienced over the past two-and-one-half years?\n\nBILL GATES: Well, sadly, many epidemics burn out, like Zika, because the number of people they can infect is simply the new birth cohort. And so we have a lot of endemic diseases at very low levels causing some burden, but not huge.\n\nEventually, most humans will have broad enough protection from the various forms of COVID that there shouldn\u2019t be a greater burden than we have typically with the flu, which of course, the flu comes and goes seasonally, and some years actually has a pretty big health burden, even when it doesn\u2019t kill people. You know, like when pregnant women get flu, that\u2019s not a good thing.\n\nIt\u2019ll be endemic at some level. The therapeutics can help a lot. It may be the world will have to take a yearly respiratory vaccine that would include both flu and the latest for the coronavirus. There\u2019s a big expense of putting that type of yearly vaccination in, including the elderly who are most at risk. But worst of this one is through, and the next one, when it comes, could be a lot worse because the death rate here was like 0.3% across all age groups. Now, 95% of that was focused on people over 50.\n\nMODERATOR: Thank you, Bill, and now opening it up for questions. To ask a question, please raise your hand. I can see a lot of hands, and we do have a lot of questions, so please ask one question at a time, and then we can always go another around.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you again, Bill. My question is, on the health systems, what is it about the health systems that we need to reorganize or rethink considering until everyone is safe, no one is safe?\n\nAnd from the experts that you\u2019ve met, like Dr. Fauci, Dr. Dr. Tedros, what are some of the profound things that you think you have learned from them that would inform the rethinking of the health systems?\n\nBILL GATES: Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say either of them are health systems people. Fauci is a vaccine researcher. But anyway, there\u2019s a huge community of people where we look at health systems, particularly primary healthcare. Most of the benefit of a health system for the broad population in a developing country, by far, is that primary health care system.\n\nThere are countries that run extremely good primary healthcare systems even in times where their economy is not very large. There are parts of India, there\u2019s Vietnam. Even in a lot of the more challenged African countries, there are places like Tanzania and Malawi, where vaccination rates are very, very high.\n\nAnd so we look at the personnel system. We look at the training. We look at the data systems. Are people paid, does the supply chain work? And we do, we have very good data on the quality of health systems. The variance, even at identical income levels is super dramatic.\n\nOne of the areas I spend a lot of time on is talking with states in Northern Nigeria that we have partnerships with about improving their health systems because in many of those areas, vaccine coverage is well under 50%. There\u2019s no reason for that.\n\nEvery country should have an 80% to 90% routine immunization coverage. That alone is one of the best impacts in terms of saving children lives.\n\nWe have the resources we put into the system. We have the training. We have the culture of using data of making sure that the equipment and the supply chain works well.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like running a store where you have to have everything in place and then constantly monitor exactly whether that\u2019s all working or not and have systems to fix it.\n\nQUESTION: Bill, from what we\u2019ve read about this book it kind of defines thought leadership. I mean, this is a grand concept that you have and a contribution to every person on the planet how to prevent the next pandemic. You\u2019ve commented already about the global governance structures, that it would be the WHO and the UN who would need to implement this.\n\nCan you comment a little bit more? We\u2019ve got this great blueprint. How do we implement it and how can those who believe in it, who do not work at the WHO, who do not work at the UN, what can we do to contribute to the world getting on board to try and prevent this tragedy again?\n\nBILL GATES: Well, it\u2019s very impressive that governments do quite a good job of protecting their citizens from certain problems.\n\nFor example, fire is the one that most people understand because they see fire hydrants, they see fire departments. They often engage in training about safe practices if a fire alarm goes off. Over time, the deaths from fires has come way down, even though historically you had entire cities that would go up in flames.\n\nThe key there is full-time people and practice. I mean, they have okay tools like ladder trucks and axes and all of those fire hydrants, but it\u2019s the alertness and the drills that take place. That\u2019s why when I look at Australia doing so well, partly the scare of the SARS-CoV-1 made them think, okay, we have to get diagnostics quickly, and that means working with these commercial diagnostics companies, with these big PCR machines. And so by doing that and putting the right quarantine policies in place, they saved a lot of Australians\u2019 lives, 90% who would have died if they\u2019d been like, say, the United States.\n\nIt is tricky, as you say, because it\u2019s got to be global, and who is in a position to help make this happen? Well, hopefully politicians realize that no country can protect itself. That is, there\u2019s enough international commerce that it will spread and affect the world. Maybe 50% of the risk of an emergence comes off of the Continent of Africa, where you have lots of humans interacting with animal species. That\u2019s what we saw with HIV and Ebola. Of course, with the flu and both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, it came out of Asia, so we have to be ready for it to emerge anywhere. But the quicker we see it, the better.\n\nAnd so only a global organization can ask all the countries to do these exercises, asking them to report the data, and then understand, okay, for some of the developing countries, the global capacity will have to help them more.\n\nWhereas for the better off countries, it\u2019s simply a matter of setting the standards and having the right communication to get the data constantly correct.\n\nTo me, in a way, because GERM is so cheap compared to the cost of this pandemic, it feels pretty obvious that we should do it. But it\u2019s not very often we add something at the global level. The WHO\u2019s responsibility has not included having a significant full-time pandemic team. And so the foundation, as we have under the polio effort and are the primary funder of that, we are building all that capacity.\n\nWell, when polio gets eradicated, that capacity should focus on other diseases. And that\u2019s partly why the GERM thing would be very, very timely.\n\nQUESTION: All right. Thank you so much. For me, listening to all that you have said so far, I\u2019m just thinking about how we can set up the finance and ecosystems to notch up homegrown innovation especially for low-income countries.\n\nBILL GATES: Well, a lot of the innovations are achievable without high technology, and some are very high technology. Running big Phase 3 trials about vaccines is an extremely complex thing.\n\nIt\u2019s like, do you want your jet engine to work in all circumstances? Understanding all of the different human diseases and variation to make sure vaccines are safe is ultra-complicated.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has been the primary funder of getting manufacturers outside of the West funded so that they can create new vaccines. The way that we brought the childhood vaccine cost down dramatically was making sure there was rotavirus for multiple developing country manufacturers. And we made sure there was measles from multiple developing country manufacturers. We made sure there was pentavalent, and then the hardest was the pneumococcus.\n\nIt took a lot of non-market funding to get those vaccines to be created. As you know, it takes over 50 million for each new vaccine in terms of the Phase 3 trials. And the quality of the factory and the quality of the regulator involved is very important.\n\nThe foundation is the biggest investor in African regulatory capacity, both to approve drugs and eventually to be able to review drug manufacturing as well. Regulatory has been tough. We\u2019ve been trying to get \u2013 the dream would be to have continent-wide regulatory alignment, but that\u2019s been too difficult.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve been funding is more regional alignment. We\u2019ve been at that for now over 15 years and made some progress on both regulatory quality and alignment. There\u2019s a lot more to do with that, which would be a necessary step to have the ideal situation, including the ability to look at manufacturing quality.\n\nOver time, these capabilities are getting out there, but philanthropy and government plans have been part of that. If you look at the overall science plan and R&D plans for Africa, vaccines would probably be a priority in that.\n\nQUESTION: The main question I have has to do with the current dilemma that Africa seems to have found itself regarding moving forward with the continent\u2019s local vaccine manufacturing initiative, which many global bodies, including the Gates Foundation supported GAVI\n\nLate last year when a South African-based establishment was approved to start producing in Africa the COVID, vaccines just a few weeks ago, we were made to realize that no African country had placed any order because of the avalanche of free doses of COVID vaccines (inaudible) need to start paying.\n\nMy question is this: How can the continent be able to achieve self-sustenance and health security projecting into the next pandemic when it still has to rely on donor-funded, aid-funded vaccines for its citizens?\n\nBILL GATES: Yeah, well, it\u2019s key to note that right now, the world has way more COVID vaccine supply than there is demand for COVID vaccines. In fact, even if the world could achieve 100% coverage, we have too much manufacturing capacity. Because so many of the vaccines succeeded, a number were funded, expecting maybe two-thirds of them would fail, most of them ended up being very good vaccines for severe disease and death.\n\nThey did not end up being perfect vaccines to block infection. We\u2019re working on a second generation of vaccines that have better duration, better infection protection and better breadth against new variants.\n\nAnd so, because building up regulatory capacity in vaccine factories is like a decade-long thing, it was never very likely that, starting from scratch during the pandemic, that a new site would make any contribution to the global vaccine availability.\n\nIn fact, Serum actually shut down their COVID vaccine manufacturing because there are simply no orders and there\u2019s a lot of vaccines expiring all over the world. The limit to vaccine vaccination is not supply. It\u2019s demand and logistics of getting these huge number of vaccines, which at least in some respects are very, very good.\n\nThe Gates Foundation, we do things to fund African science. We do things like agricultural productivity things or nutrition things that will play a role in improving productivity, and therefore, over time, economic strength.\n\nI\u2019m not sure every country should make everything itself. I think there will still be intercontinental trade for some things, but the path forward is better regulatory science, better understanding of where the new market opportunities are.\n\nThere are some distributed manufacturing approaches where you could draw on the expertise of some companies, and they could put vaccine manufacturing sites in Africa. And at first, the expertise would not all be in Africa, but over time, you would transfer that.\n\nBioNTech\u2019s been talking about that. We\u2019re the only group that actually funds. We fund yellow fever vaccine manufacturing in Senegal. It\u2019s not gigantic numbers, but it\u2019s something that it\u2019s a proof of principle that we got the regulatory and quality issues to be good enough.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t over focus on vaccines, though. I mean, if you want to stop pandemics, diagnostics are way more important. It\u2019s only once the pandemic gets out of control that then you go to vaccines.\n\nWe have a lot of routine vaccines, and of course, the Gates Foundation is the biggest funder of the invention of a malaria vaccine, a TB vaccine and an HIV vaccine. And so, with distributed manufacturing, with better regulatory, some of those vaccines can be made in Africa.\n\nMy goal is that we have those vaccines exist. That\u2019s the great tragedy, is not exactly where they\u2019re made, but that there is no malaria vaccine. And it\u2019s very strange how few partners we have in funding malaria vaccine work.\n\nQUESTION: I know after the 2014 to the 2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, one of the big areas that the foundation was focusing on, especially when it comes to government preparedness, was supporting the establishment of emergency operations centers, something that I think happened in a few West African countries.\n\nAnd so, I\u2019m curious now, with the rethinking of how to prepare for the next pandemic, especially after COVID, is this still something that\u2019s being pursued or will this change? Will the strategy for this change? Thanks.\n\nBILL GATES: Well, the so-called emergency operation centers is something that we have a lot of experience with, with our partners, because when we\u2019re doing polio eradication work, we pull those together, sometimes at a national and sometimes at a regional level. And it lets you really coordinate the campaigns that you\u2019re doing, look at your coverage, look at your refusals, look at your supplies, look at your hiring and your maps, and all the complex logistics that go into getting very high coverage.\n\nAnd so, every country should have a plan that when there\u2019s an outbreak, okay, where do they draw on people? Obviously, if there\u2019s an outbreak in a few countries, there will be global resources that are coming in to help out, to the degree a country is willing both to do the drills to see, okay, where will we get the diagnostics, how would we set up quarantine policy, how would we communicate. And when the real thing is coming in, there\u2019ll be immense global resources to try and prevent the spread to the entire continent or even to every country in the world. The basic approach is there.\n\nOur focus, we always look at lives saved and lives improved in our work. For us, our biggest story is malaria, and HIV and polio, but we found ourselves building some of the infrastructure things like CHAMPS, which is a minimally invasive autopsy to see what causes of death is, CAMSA, which is a statistical approach to seeing what the disease burden looks like. We\u2019ve ended up funding a lot of basic infrastructure, which ideally, the global health endeavor would be funding those things, including the overall summary, which is called the Global Burden of Disease, which is primarily funded by us.\n\nQUESTION: When we are dealing with outbreaks such as polio, measles or Ebola, scientists already know what they are and what to do, and they also have the tools to tackle them, be it prevention or treatment.\n\nSome of the earlier challenges with COVID was the fact that scientists had no knowledge of the virus itself, and they are still actually learning as the pandemic progressed. And what is the best case scenario to prepare when it is a new disease and scientists have no knowledge on it?\n\nBILL GATES: Well, the greatest risk by far is viruses that are spread human to human in respiratory. And there\u2019s three big virus families that do that: Measles, we\u2019ve learned a lot about; smallpox, of course, we were able to eradicate; flu was probably the one people were most worried about because of the 1918.\n\nThese coronaviruses have been studied. There\u2019s coronavirus diseases in chickens. We do vaccines for chickens for a form of coronavirus, and that was one of the sources of the crazy rumors that we had some patent on a coronavirus, which was actually a chicken coronavirus that one of our grantees filed, but it was about saving the lives of chickens.\n\nThe way that respiratory viruses work, they have to latch on to upper respiratory tract. And so, we can understand, can we get the upper respiratory tract on high alert? Can we get the innate immune system through some pathogen-independent drug to be ready so that, say, for 90 days, you\u2019re very unlikely to get infected?\n\nLikewise, because of it\u2019s got to be respiratory, things like masks, like distancing, those are going to apply to whatever this new pathogen is.\n\nBut as you say, it might surprise us. That\u2019s why we have to go and sequence it. We fund a thing called Geyser (ph), which is getting sequencing capacity in Africa to be adequate, and that\u2019s worked very well for the COVID work.\n\nThe foundation was the only funder of the trials of the vaccines in Africa, and that was to build their safety credibility, and also to have a group of patients who are living with HIV and understand were there are special considerations about the vaccine there. And as part of that, those trials a lot of capacity was put in place. And now, the variant sequencing work has been done reasonably well in different parts of Africa. But yes, we have to accept that we might get surprised.\n\nWe benefited that SARS-CoV-2 COVID was a lot like SARS-CoV-1. The spike protein is very similar. And so, the fact we had a vaccine candidate, we did the sequence and we had a vaccine candidate within 30 days. Part of that was that we\u2019d seen a fairly similar virus and done some work on that before.\n\nQUESTION: What role can technology play in future pandemic planning and forecasting in Africa? And how does Africa stand in relation to other countries, other regions, sorry, in its adoption of the technologies that can help with the next pandemic? Thank you.\n\nBILL GATES: Well, the disease modeling work that the Gates Foundation funds started because of our work in malaria and polio. We wanted to know where we were going to get polio outbreaks, and we wanted to understand what set of interventions would lead to actual successful malaria eradication.\n\nA lot of failed efforts at malaria eradication had taken place in the past. And so, we thought only by having really strong models for this would we understand what was necessary.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve generalized those models to things like HIV and TB. We\u2019ve made those open source, and we have a lot of collaborators in Africa who take the base model work we do and they put their data in, their assumptions in. And so, particularly in HIV and TB, we\u2019ve had some great collaborations. With malaria, some of that\u2019s with Swiss Tropical. But models can help you understand risks and realize should you try to do an eradication or not.\n\nThe capacity for this type of work, it\u2019s mainly the universities. And so, South Africa stands out as having somewhat more of this expertise, but it\u2019s as you get medical universities with public health programs that then you have people who can take the base level stuff that we make completely free \u2013 this is open source completely \u2013 and play around with it.\n\nOne thing it\u2019s shown us is it\u2019s going to be hard to get rid of malaria, and that\u2019s partly why you hear us being such advocates for tools like Gene Drive that can reduce mosquito populations, Anopheles mosquito populations, because our simulation shows we really need to knock, at least for about three years, knock the mosquito populations down before we could possibly do eliminations in the tougher areas, including DRC and Nigeria.\n\nThe modeling stuff is a shared resource, but the strength of the universities will determine how much that gets exploited.\n\nQUESTION: You said in your recent TED Talk that your warnings about the pandemic in 2015, that 90% of people who have listened to that video listened to it after the pandemic. And, of course, we had to pay a lot for not listening.\n\nAnd now, of course, you\u2019re raising an important question for the world at this time. Do you think the world is listening this time around?\n\nBILL GATES: It\u2019s hard to say. The world has a lot of challenges. You\u2019ve got the war in Ukraine, you\u2019ve got unrest in Ethiopia, you\u2019ve got unrest in other parts of Africa. It\u2019s not a simple situation, and sadly, the world\u2019s going through a bout of inflation, particularly or food prices and fuel prices.\n\nWe\u2019ll see fertilizer costs go up, and we\u2019re super worried that that means a lot of African farmers will use less fertilizer. And then that means you have less food a year from now, and that can be self-reinforcing.\n\nIt\u2019s not like, even for the foundation, we\u2019re only working on pandemic preparedness. We\u2019re still working on nutrition, and HIV and malaria, but given that it cost trillions and that the investment to avoid this is just billions, it seems like the most obvious thing. And after we had world wars, we did work. We created the United Nations and lots of ways that fortunately, have minimized at least the larger wars since that was over.\n\nAnd so, I do expect the debate during the next year to take some of my ideas and other people\u2019s ideas and say, governments ought to prepare their citizens, like they prepare for earthquakes or fires or war, that they need to do this.\n\nThe rich countries were deeply affected. And so, the financing for the GERM, the financing for the innovation and even some of the financing for the health systems should come from the rich countries, but I can\u2019t guarantee it because they have so many priorities and the pandemic stretched their budgets in an extreme way. And now, with Ukraine, they see all the demands coming out of that in parallel.",
          "summary": "BILL GATES: Well, the COVID pandemic has been an incredible tragedy, with the costs, and you have economic damage.\nBILL GATES: Well, a lot of the innovations are achievable without high technology, and some are very high technology.\nWe have a lot of routine vaccines, and of course, the Gates Foundation is the biggest funder of the invention of a malaria vaccine, a TB vaccine and an HIV vaccine.\nAnd it\u2019s very strange how few partners we have in funding malaria vaccine work.\nBILL GATES: Well, the disease modeling work that the Gates Foundation funds started because of our work in malaria and polio.",

Such people do not represent who we are.\n\n\u201cI would, therefore, like to reiterate the resolve of the state government, to deal decisively with the perpetrators of the mayhem, some of whom have been arrested by the security agencies.\n\n\u201cI have also directed the security agencies to dig into the remote and immediate causes of the incident and to act, to forestall a recurrence not only at Gudum Hausawa but across all the communities in the state.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we will not relent in our drive to ensure continuous peaceful coexistence among the heterogeneous ethnic and religious groups in the state.\n\n\u201cI appeal for your continued understanding, cooperation and support towards the realisation of this noble objective,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governor stated that his administration was mindful of the current economic difficulties being experienced by the people of the state, saying that the situation was a national problem.\n\n\u201cLet me reassure you that we are mindful of the economic difficulties being experienced by the people of the State, which is a national problem.\n\n\u201cMy dear compatriots, as we mark the Eid El Fitr, let us spare a thought for our men and women under arms who, on a daily basis, place themselves on the frontlines and in harm\u2019s way, that our peace, security and comfort may be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cWe also remember their families and loved ones who, together with their spouses, bear a greater burden of the terrifying times in which we live.

          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has said Nigeria crude oil output declined by 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April 2022.\n\nThis was contained in \u201cReuters survey of OPEC crude oil production (the month of April 2022).\u201d\n\nIt noted that there was lower export in the period under review than March.\n\nNigerian output posted a 40,000 bpd decline, the survey found, with lower exports than in March.\n\nIt also noted that the increase in OPEC\u2019s oil output in April undershot the rise planned under a deal with allies, a Reuters survey found, as declines in Libya and Nigeria offset supply increases by Saudi Arabia and other top producers.\n\nAccording to the survey: \u201cOPEC pumped 28.58 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, the survey found, up 40,000 bpd from the previous month and short of the 254,000 bpd increase called for under the supply deal.\n\n\u201cOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, are slowly relaxing 2020 output cuts as demand recovers from the pandemic. OPEC+ meets on Thursday and is expected to confirm a previously agreed output hike despite the surge in oil prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably the view is to maintain the plan,\u201d an OPEC delegate said of Thursday\u2019s meeting. The deal called for a 400,000 bpd increase in April from all OPEC+ members, of which about 254,000 bpd is shared by the 10 OPEC producers the agreement covers.\n\nOutput undershot the pledged hikes from October to March, with the exception of February, according to Reuters surveys, as many producers lack the capacity to pump more crude following insufficient investment, a trend accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nAs a result, the 10 OPEC members are pumping far less than called for under the deal. OPEC compliance with pledged cuts was 164%, the survey found, versus 151% in March. Libya, Nigeria drop.\n\nThe biggest drop in output was in Libya, which at one point in April was losing more than 550,000 bpd from blockades on fields and terminals. Libya is one of the OPEC members exempt from making output cuts.\n\nNigerian output posted a 40,000 bpd decline, the survey found, with lower exports than in March. Force majeure remains in place on the Bonny Light export stream. These outages limited the increase in OPEC\u2019s output as top producers followed through on the pledged hike in supply.\n\nThe biggest rise in April of 100,000 bpd came from Saudi Arabia, the survey found. Iraq, which reported a month-on-month rise in exports, boosted output by 80,000 bpd.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates followed through on its higher quota and added 40,000 bpd, while Kuwait\u2019s output edged up by 10,000 bpd.\n\nIran, also exempt from making output cuts, has been shipping more to China in 2022 and production rose in April, the survey found, even as talks on reviving its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers have yet to reach a deal.\n\nProduction in Venezuela, another exempt producer, edged higher. Production fell or did not increase in Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, the survey found, because of a lack of capacity to produce more.\n\nThe Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market. It is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data, information from tanker trackers such as Petro-Logistics, as well as information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.\n\nThe following table shows crude output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in millions of barrels per day (bpd) in April and March, according to a Reuters survey published on Monday.\n\nOPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, are unwinding record output cuts made in 2020 yet are struggling to achieve their planned monthly production increases.\n\nIn April, the cuts required of OPEC stood at 1.368 million bpd, less than the actual cuts by the 10 OPEC members bound by the deal that stood at 2.243 million bpd, Reuters calculations and OPEC figures showed.\n\nThat put OPEC\u2019s compliance with its pledged cuts at 164% in April, up from 151% in March. March\u2019s output was not revised. The figures in the first, second and fourth columns in the table are in millions of barrels per day.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe stated this, yesterday, after observing the Eid prayers at the Mambila Barracks Parade Ground, Abuja in commemoration of this year\u2019s Sallah celebration.\n\nAsked who he would hand over to in 2023, Buhari replied: \u201cThe person that Nigerians elect.\u201d\n\nThe president said his administration would continue to work to make the country safe for Nigerians. He said it was important to make the country safe, especially with the onset of the rainy season so that farmers are assured of their safety as they return to their farms to boost food security in the country.\n\n\u201cHeads of the services; Army, Navy, Air Force, the Inspector-General of Police and so on, are very much aware of the situation. It\u2019s their duties to know where the terrorists are and eliminate them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari has confirmed that terrorists were behind the Abuja-Kaduna train attacks, and 62 in captivity were being used as human shields by the criminals.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

I urge the railway management to immediately set up a situation room for the coordination of the rescue mission and for a minute by minute engagement with the families of the captives.\n\n\u201cThis should ease their pain and anxiety as we push the military to finding a safe return to their families. My aim is to see all those in captivity safely rescued.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me assure Nigerians that the bandits are just pushing their luck, but this is only for a while before they are finally crushed. They are using civilians as human shields, thereby making it difficult to confront them directly,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the President, bandits and terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, don\u2019t respect the rules of engagement and could resort to harming hostages when attacked.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack. It\u2019s a delicate situation that requires wisdom, caution and also patience. Any rescue operation that results in the death of any hostage cannot be deemed a success.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want this kind of tragic outcome. It\u2019s a complex situation that demands proper handling. The primary objective of any rescue operation is to free the hostages safely, unharmed and alive.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Party appeals ruling to show cause why primary should not be suspended*Second aggrieved group says party can only rotate candidacy, not presidency\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nTwo Groups have moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s silence on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nOne of the groups is led by one of its presidential aspirants and a former Deputy Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Mr. Cosmas Ndukwe, moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s stand on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nThe kernel of their cases are that the PDP over the years had a tradition of power rotation and zoning.\n\nThe group argued that the only office the opposition party has to offer was the presidential candidate, which they argued should rotate between the north and the south\n\n\n\nThey cited the fact that since the return of democracy in 1999, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, from southern Nigeria was the first to govern the country, followed by the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua from the northern part of the country. This was followed by Goodluck Jonathan from the southern part of the country and now Muhammadu Buhari from the north.\n\n\n\nJustice Donatus Okorowo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had last Thursday, ordered the PDP to appear before it on May 5, to show cause why the request of one of its presidential aspirants to stop the scheduled primary election for the selection of the party\u2019s flag bearer in the 2023 presidential election should not be granted.\n\n\n\nThe PDP had fixed May 28, for the conduct of its presidential primary election and to that effect screened the 17 aspirants who obtained the presidential form to run in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nIn the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/508/2022 are the PDP, National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Atu, Senator Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) as 1st to fourth respondents respectively.\n\nRather than grant the request, the judge ordered that the PDP should appear before it and show cause why the court should not accede to the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\n\n\n\nIn the suit filed by his lawyer, Mr Paul Erokoro, Ndukwe also challenged the scheduled presidential primary on the grounds that it breached its own constitution on zoning.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP has a rotation of elective offices in place, and by that arrangement, it ought to be the turn of the south to produce the president.\n\n\n\nAs of last week, it was obvious that the PDP was not considering zoning its Presidential ticket to the south as being clamoured by southern governors and other leaders in the zone.\n\n\n\nAlso, a member of the other group challenging the party over the issue of zoning, who pleaded to remain anonymous, pointed out that, \u201cthe presidency is not for the PDP to give; the only thing the PDP can give is its presidential ticket and that must be rotated.\n\n\n\nBut the PDP has challenged the jurisdiction of a Federal High Court to summon it over the issue which the party described as its internal affairs.\n\n\n\nThis emerged just as former Minister of Police Affairs and member of the zoning committee of the party, Adamu Maina Waziri has called on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket of the party.\n\n\n\nThe PDP in a Notice of Preliminary Objection filed on Friday, by its lawyer, Mr Mahmud Magaji, submitted that the subject matter of the case which borders on whether to zone its presidential ticket to any part of the country was not an issue that the court has the mandate to decide.\n\n\n\nThe PDP asked the court to strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction and also dismiss it for being \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.\n\nAccording to the defendants, \u201cthe cause of action in the suit relates to the internal affairs of a political party and therefore falls within the doctrine of political questions which are non-justiciable\u201d and as such the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of statute-barred, the PDP noted that the cause of action arose from the PDP National Zoning Committee Communique of April 5 whereas the plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed on April 19 (15 days after) in violation of Section 285 of the Constitution which provides for 14 days to file such cases.\n\n\n\nWhile arguing further that the plaintiff lacked the necessary legal right to initiate the case, the PDP submitted that no civil right of the plaintiff has been wrong pursuant to section 6(6) of the Constitution.\n\nThe party, therefore, urged the court to uphold its objection and dismiss the case of the plaintiff, adding that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced or suffer any hardship if the case was dismissed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the 3rd defendant in the suit Senator Anyanwu had approached the Court of Appeal to set aside the order of Justice Okorowo on the defendants to show cause, arguing that the trial judge erred in law when it arrived at that decision without according to them a fair hearing.\n\n\n\nAmong other complaints against the judgment of the lower court was that while the originating summons of Ndukwe was not ripe for hearing, the time for appellants to respond to the suit has also not lapsed, adding that respondents have taken steps to file counter affidavit against the suit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe learned trial judge erred in entertaining an ex parte motion which seeks to stop the presidential primary election of the appellant without hearing notice\u201d, adding that the court further erred in law when it failed to \u201caver its mind to section 84(15) of the Electoral Act, 2022, before making an order to show cause\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe appellant in the Notice of Appeal dated April 29, further urged the court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of Justice Okorowo asking the PDP to show cause why its scheduled primary election should not be halted.\n\nPDP Presidential Ticket: Let Delegates Decide, Ex-minister Tells Party Leaders\n\nMeanwhile, Waziri who called on the NEC of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket the of the party, also alleged that the issue of zoning in the party was being fuelled by external influences who are not members of the party.\n\n\n\nThe ex-minister claimed that at no time did the PDP mandate General Ibrahim Babangida and Prof. Ango Abdullahi to help it find a consensus candidate for the party\n\nHe said the PDP was not obliged to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election, saying the party was preoccupied to use any legitimate method to win the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are a party in opposition, our concern at the moment is to use any legitimate process to get back to power. It is the ruling party that should be concerned with zoning, but not the PDP. Ours as an opposition party is to win through Democratic measure.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur concern is to allow the delegates to the presidential convention to the analysis and know who out of the cleared presidential aspirants has the competence and strength of character to win the presidential election for the party \u201c\n\nThe former Minister of Police Affairs stressed that Babangida and Abdullahi have no mandate of the party to conduct any consensus for the presidential candidate to emerge.\n\n\n\nAccording to the former minister who is also a member of the 37-man think tank on zoning, who spoke on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, \u201d it is not true that zoning is tearing the PDP apart. It is all about media creation and external influences that are creating the media controversy within the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you not hear what two frontline presidential aspirants, Peter Obi and Emmanuel Udom said the position of the PDP on zoning is supreme as the party decision on this is final. We will enthrone the best method that would be in the interest of the party and democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "RenCap: With Oil Prices above $100 Per Barrel, Impact on Budget will Be Negligible",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA new report by Renaissance Capital (RenCap), a frontier market investment company, has stated that despite crude oil prices at over $100 per barrel, the impact on Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position would remain negligible due to petrol subsidy payments and falling oil production by the country.\n\n\n\nIt also predicted that Nigeria would make a gross revenue of $25 billion from oil sales this year, although this would also have very insignificant impact on the country\u2019s fiscal position.\n\n\n\nIn the report titled, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Budget: Does it benefit from high oil prices?\u201d the firm, which also provides institutional research and financial advisory services, noted that on the fiscal front, the petrol subsidy and falling oil production undermines gains on the government revenue side. It estimated that subsidy cost could increase by $1.5 billion to $2 billion for a $10 per barrel change in the oil price, while net oil revenue could rise between $4 billion and $5 billion, without factoring in other externalities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis implies that Nigeria has a $3 billion net benefit for every $10 per barrel change to the oil price (Brent),\u201d it stated.\n\n\n\nBut explaining that Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position would not benefit from high oil prices in 2022, the report noted that the swelling of the petrol subsidy as oil price increased and the fall in oil production due to theft and underinvestment would combine to hobble any gains from rising oil prices.\n\n\n\nThe federal government recently increased the 2022 subsidy budget from N443 billion to N4 trillion, after it shifted the planned removal of what it terms under-recovery by 18 months.\n\n\n\nRenCap said in the report, \u201cAn 80 per cent increase in the oil price, from $41/bbl to $72/bbl, reduced the budget deficit by about 1 ppt only. 2021 was an outlier. We attribute the widening of the deficit in 2021, despite the high oil price, to the fall in production that countered the price effect.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur \u2018trendline\u2019 suggests that if we assume an average oil price of $100/bbl for 2022 and production at pre-2021 levels, then the FGN\u2019s budget deficit would come in at about 3.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We are forecasting a deficit of 4.7 per cent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the year-to-date average Brent crude price of about $100 per barrel, the Nigerian government, the report stated, took 45 per cent to 50 per cent of gross oil sales in the form of taxes and royalties. The remainder, it added, went to the contractor as cost recovery and profits.\n\n\n\nIt stressed, \u201cIn 2022, at $100/bbl Brent, we estimate that gross oil revenues to the government, mostly taxes and royalties, will be $24.8 billion/N10.3 trillion, that is 4.9 per cent of GDP, assuming the current FX rate of NGN415/$1, and net oil revenues at $17 billion/N7.1 trillion (3.4 per cent of GDP).\n\n\n\n\u201cOf this, 80 per cent stems from onshore/shallow water oil fields and the remainder from deepwater oil fields.\u201d\n\nStill at $100 per barrel, in 2022, it also estimated petrol subsidy to be 34 per cent of the government\u2019s gross oil revenue and 50 per cent of net oil revenues.\n\n\n\nAt the current N415 official rate of the naira to the dollar, on an accruals basis, RenCap estimated that the subsidy ranged between 23 per cent and 27 per cent of gross oil revenue for $60 110/bbl Brent.\n\n\n\nBut it added that the impact of a naira devaluation on the numbers at N500/$ and N600/$ and assuming that the pump price did not change, would raise subsidy to between $10 billion and $11.3 billion.\n\n\n\nAccording to the organisation, that is based on the assumption that Nigeria consumes 23 billion litres of petrol a year (400kbpd), taken from the most recent 12-month consumption data, forecasting that subsidy would only be wiped off when oil prices are below $45-$50 per barrel.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelow this price,\u201d it stated, \u201cthe government\u2019s take of oil proceeds is fully remitted and not undermined by petrol subsidy deductions. The reinstatement of the petrol subsidy in January partly explains the revision of the FY22 budget targets and assumptions, including the widening of the deficit target,\u201d\n\n\n\nIn April, the federal government revised its budget deficit target to four per cent per cent of GDP in 2022, as against its initial target of 3.4 per cent, on the back of new developments, including the Russia/Ukraine situation.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had written to the National Assembly calling for an amendment to the budget, to account for the wider deficit and increase in borrowing.\n\n\n\nBuhari said the new developments included the reinstatement of the petrol subsidy, the sharp increase in oil prices, and significantly lower crude production, mainly due to production shut-ins because of massive crude theft between the production platforms and terminals.\n\n\n\nThe president also proposed adjusting the government\u2019s budget assumptions to include the increase in the oil price benchmark to $73 per barrel, from $62/bbl previously, lower projected crude production to 1.60 mbd, from 1.88mbd previously, and an increase in the estimated provision for the petrol subsidy for 2022 to N4 trillion.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThis is also an increase when compared to the N3 trillion that the NNPC called for in January, soon after it was announced that the subsidy would remain in place.\n\n\n\n\u201cDue to the adjustments, the federation account revenue pool for the three tiers of government is projected to fall by N2.4 trillion (1.1 per cent of GDP, by our estimate), and the FGN\u2019s share by N1.2 trillion (0.6 per cent of GDP).\u201d\n\nThe document projected Nigeria\u2019s 2022 oil production to be within the 1.5 bpd to 1. 7 million bpd range, with 1.6 million bpd as midpoint, comprising one million onshore and shallow water production as well as 500k bpd for deepwater.\n\n\n\nIt explained that after deductions related to the oil and gas sector, including federally funded upstream capex, contributions to the 13 per cent derivation fund for the Niger Delta oil-producing states and other items, Nigeria\u2019s net oil revenue could be $17 billion in 2022.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Anyim: South-east\u2019s Most Important Demand is Reintegration",
          "text": "\n\n* Says agitations will die with Igbo presidency\n\nChuks Okocha\n\nFormer Senate President and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has said the ongoing agitations in some parts of the South East of Nigeria, was a reflection of the level of frustration by people of the zone, whose most important single demand was nothing but reintegration into the country.\n\n\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in the third of a presidential interview series, Anyim, who responded to a question on how to reconcile his presidential bid with the heightened and violent agitation for Biafra by some people from the South-east, however, said with an Igbo presidency, the agitations would die naturally.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose agitating are frustrated, young, South-easterners, and I tell you, maybe I will put it this way, somebody asked me once, what is the single most important demands of the south east? And I replied, the most important single demand of the south-east from Nigeria is reintegration.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce they feel that they have been fully reintegrated into Nigeria, all agitation will naturally be extinguished. So, my position is that if you give them a sense of belonging, and maybe expand opportunities for everybody, and they feel equal as citizens of Nigeria, those agitations will simply be extinguished.\u201d\n\n\n\nPushed further if his aspiration would not make the South East quest for secession a lot easier, Anyim, who was Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), explained that the agitations were not new, but has only been given life, because the issues have not been addressed at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe agitation for Biafra is neither isolated nor new. I remember during the June 12 crisis, there were such huge agitations in the South-west, that it is either they are part of this country, or they are not. And eventually, when one of them became the president of the country, that agitation died out.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also know that the militancy in the Niger Delta was so bad that if not for the way President Olusegun Obasanjo managed it, it would have led to agitations like this, and it was at a time everybody was so scared that if you allow somebody from South-south become president of Nigeria, they will graduate that agitation to secession.\n\n\n\n\u201cImmediately, President Goodluck Jonathan became president of Nigeria, that agitation died. In fact, not when he became president, immediately he became vice president of Nigeria, that agitation died out. IPOB agitation is not the only one in the country today.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a number of them across the country like the Boko Haram insurgency, like Sunday Igboho\u2019s agitation in the South-west. I believe that if a South-easterner becomes the president of Nigeria, that agitation will die,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAsked what his take on restructuring was and the recent suggestion by a legal luminary, Chief Afe Babalola, that government should try out an interim government that would allow for a period of time to come up with a more viable constitution, Anyim said restructuring meant different things to different people.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cI avoid getting into the controversy of the definition of restructuring, but one thing I know is that the structure the country assumed at independence was extensively negotiated, extensively canvassed and extensively agreed on.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were negotiations, there were constitutional conferences, and even at the last lap, the minorities raised issues or fears and the colonial masters set up the Willink\u2019s Commission to look into their fears. They didn\u2019t just decree a structure for the nation. No, they did not at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, if we for any reason think that the present structure we have is not working, we have to sit down discuss it and build a consensus going forward, not anybody waking up to say, this is my definition of restructuring. If you throw in anything by your own definition, it will not work, because other components of the polity will not accept it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I agree that we could present a platform for dialogue, for negotiations, for discussions and build a consensus. Based on that consensus, if we need to make an adjustment, we\u2019ll make an adjustment as agreed by all and such adjustment everybody will commit to it in building the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t want to go into the meaning of anybody\u2019s definition of restructuring. But I want to believe that if all of us feel that the structure we have today is not what we want, we will all sit over and agree on the structure that works for all of us and now carry on from there.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Babalola, the Ebonyi-born politician said, \u201cI am surprised that Afe Babalola made that suggestion, because one, he is a seasoned lawyer and two, more particularly, because that is unconstitutional. And certainly there can\u2019t be a vacuum. So, what provision of our constitution will authorise interim government?\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you can\u2019t preach the rule of law and step outside the law to set up a structure that cannot work. So, because it\u2019s unconstitutional, it has no space in our system. That cannot work.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I also know that under any government, that the country can still have discussions. The country can still have negotiations and dialogue, and arrive at a consensus, that will be acceptable to everybody and we\u2019ll build our nation on that. So, certainly, that has no space in our system.\u201d\n\n*See full interview on pages 19 \u2013 21\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Ruling party\u2019s position careless, ill-considered, says PANDEF\n\n*APC\u2019s claim, an invitation to anarchy, South-south Elders\u2019 Forum warns*Withdraw statement on zoning, Arewa youths tell Adamu\n\n*APC must zone presidency to South-east, Ohanaeze insists\n\nDeji Elumoye, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Segun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nCondemnations have trailed the claim by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday that it had not decided on where to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had before the party\u2019s March 26 National Convention, stated that even though the ruling party had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Senator Abdullahi Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of Adamu from the North is a strong indication that the presidential candidate of the party will automatically come from the South.\n\n\n\nBut Adamu, who spoke on the controversial zoning issue after presenting the party\u2019s candidate in the forthcoming Ekiti State governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, on Friday, said the party had not taken any zoning decision.\n\n\n\nHe said such a decision would be the job of the entire party, which he said was bigger than himself as chairman.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am today privileged to be the Chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Arewa Consultative Youth Forum (ACYF), and the South-South Elders\u2019 Forum (SSEF) have condemned the indecision of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday said he would support President Muhammadu Buhari and APC\u2019s preferred candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nIn its reaction to APC\u2019s indecision on zoning, PANDEF described Adamu\u2019s claim as careless and ill-considered.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on the issue, PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, noted that with the swapping of positions between the North and South, the understanding was that the presidential candidate of the party would come from the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can he (Adamu) make such a remark? Do they mean well for this country at all? This is a man who emerged as National Chairman of the party through the instrumentality of zoning,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nHe noted that all the positions in the party had been switched between the South and North.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is an established political stratagem of political parties in the country that any time the national chairmanship position of a party goes to the South, the presidency goes to the North and the other way round. In 2014, the APC zoned its national chairmanship position to the South, and the presidency went to the North; therefore, in 2023, the presidency of the APC, and indeed, any serious political party in Nigeria must go to the South. Anything otherwise would be more than an overture to undesirable cataclysms in the country,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlso reacting, the SSEF warned that any attempt to deny the South the position of the presidential candidate of the APC would be an invitation to anarchy.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Leader of the SSEF, Chief Anabs Sara-Igbe, such a decision will give ethnic nationalities in the South a sense that they are not wanted in the country.\n\n\n\nSara-Igbe expressed the fear that any attempt to jettison the unwritten gentlemen\u2019s agreement between the North and the South would lead to a catastrophic reaction, the end of which nobody can predict.\n\nOn its part, the ACYF has called on the National Chairman of APC, Adamu, to withdraw his statement that the party had not taken a position on zoning.\n\n\n\nThe ACYF, in a statement yesterday, said the statement credited to Adamu was capable of heating the polity and spelling doom for the party if not quickly withdrawn.\n\n\n\nThe group said it was worrisome that the party chairman could come up with such an inflammable statement when all critical stakeholders are already on the same page on the need for the presidency to return to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate statement credited to Senator Adamu is regrettable just as it is demeaning of his status as the chairman of a ruling party.\n\n\u201cEven a political novice is aware that the consensus from critical political stakeholders is that the presidency must return to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis statement that no agreement had been reached on zoning is not in the best interest of the party.\n\n\u201cThe statement is capable of leading to electoral defeat for our great party if not quickly withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a statement that can confuse, overheat the polity and eventually lead to electoral defeat.\n\n\u201cLeaders must learn to weigh their words and also feel the pulse of the people when making statements on issues as important as this,\u201d AYCF explained.\n\n\n\nIn its reaction, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate strong courage and leadership by prevailing on his party to zone the 2023 presidency to the South-east.\n\n\n\nSpeaking through its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the organisation said those who came up with the issue of dividing the country along zonal structures were not wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome patriots tried to create six zones for the country and this was done to ensure equity, justice and fairness. That singular action has helped to stabilise the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the same wisdom that made President Olusegun Obasanjo to ensure the emergence of a northerner in 2007 even when the odds strongly favoured the then Governor Peter Odili. Since then, power has been moving from North to South.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time around, Buhari has to decide and ensure that nothing truncates this process to maintain peace, unity and corporate existence of Nigeria. As the leader of the country and the leader of the APC, President Buhari must demonstrate strong courage by ensuring that power is moved to South-east after him,\u201d the organisation noted.\n\n\n\nThe organisation, however, warned that anything outside zoning the presidency to the South-east zone would not only boomerang but threaten the nation\u2019s very existence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way APC prevaricates over this issue of zoning is troubling. We however believe that the onus lies on the president; but if he chooses to play the ostrich, he should also bear in mind that history will not be kind to him. He must sail this ship to safe harbour.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they fail to do the needful, let them bear in mind that restiveness, insecurity and cries of marginalisation will never cease and those championing such will be right. The President must write his name in gold by doing the right thing,\u201d Ogbonnia explained.\n\nI will Support Whoever is Buhari, APC\u2019s Choice, Says Amaechi\n\nIn another development, the Minister of Transportation, Amaechi, yesterday said he would support President Buhari and APC\u2019s chosen candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nAmaechi expressed his loyalty to President Buhari and the APC.\n\nAmaechi, in a statement, said this at a consultative meeting with executives, delegates and another party faithful at the Rivers APC Secretariat at the weekend.\n\n\n\nThe minister indicated that in his bid to become the President of Nigeria, which he is thoroughly qualified for, he was neither desperate nor disloyal.\n\n\n\nThe two terms governor of Rivers said it was sad that many politicians do not understand the concept of loyalty.\n\n\u201cLoyalty is not when you are not chosen, you become disloyal, loyalty means you follow the man that leads you, that you have surrendered to his leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t follow, it means you are not loyal, you are only benefitting from the man politically and economically. The day he\u2019s not able to give you that economic reality, is the day you become disloyal.\n\n\u201cI am a very loyal person, and those who are disloyal, I wish them well, those who want to do whatever they want to do, I wish them well,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the opportunity will be given to everybody and all will run in this presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe will run and I am loyal to the President and I am loyal to the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the party says it is me, thank God. If the party says it is not me, whoever the party chooses, I will support it.\n\n\u201cIf the party and President choose anybody, I will support the person, if the party chooses me, I will be glad and say thank God,\u201d Amaechi explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Polygamy Versus Monogamy Debate: A Response To Reno Omokri By Aaron Ukodie",
          "text": "I have read the argument by Mr. Reno Omokri stating that God is not against Polygamy; that of a fact God endorses and there is nowhere in scripture that speaks against polygamy.\n\nI will respond to Omokri, stating rightly that he has a wrong understanding of the difference between the Old Testament (OT) and the New Testament (NT), which is brought about by Jesus\u2019s death, burial, and resurrection. We must begin this conversation by understanding that Jesus came to give us a new life and a new way of living; in some cases different from the OT order; while in some others giving a new perspective to OT requirements and worldview. Jesus came to reorder the disordering of God\u2019s Order from the beginning of the creation of man. So, the OT does not really give us a perfect picture of God\u2019s mind. That is why Bible says the OT is a shadow of the NT.\n\nSo, let us begin from the beginning by explaining God\u2019s order or intention regarding marriage. This is what God said and intended for marriage in the beginning, as expressly stated in Genesis 2: 24.\n\n\u201cTherefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh\". Note the scripture said WIFE and not WIVES. In creation, God created ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN. And that scripture says the MAN and WOMAN, when they are joined together would become ONE FLESH, not TWO FLESH; not THREE FLESH. So, further, interrogate this statement. When a man marries TWO WIVES, the One Man and Two Women cannot become One Flesh. They become TWO Fleshes\n\n\n\nWe see that the man, Adam, and the woman, Eve stayed true to this injunction. There is no record that Adam married another wife.\n\nWe also see that once Adam and Eve disobeyed God, the man began to walk against the ways of God. In fact, the bible records that wickedness began to increase on the earth, on account of Adam and Eve\u2019s disobedience of God\u2019s instruction. So pervasion of the God order and way of life started seeping into human soul and existence. Genesis 6 verse 1-3 says: \u201cNow it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took WIVES for themselves of all whom they chose.\" So, we see a flagrant disrespect of the God order. Wicked and lustful men began to take wives \u201cof all whom they chose\u201d.\n\nOmokri made the argument that several bible characters did not heed this demand or instruction and God did not punish them; He even approved of them. We see Abraham, who married two wives; David, who committed adultery with Beersheba and married her; Solomon, who married several wives, several Israel Kings, who married several wives in the list of those who married more than one wife and God did not punish them. In fact, God told David when he went for Uriah\u2019s wife that if he had asked for more wives He would have given more to him. The point needs to be made here that by the time David came to the scene Moses had given the law on marriage which allowed the Patriarchs to marry more than one wife. God had decided to allow polygamy, by regulating its practice in the Law of Moses.\n\nBut we would get to understand later that because God permitted it did not mean it was God\u2019s perfect will or original plan. A disruption of His order had begun to take place on earth. We have seen from scriptures that it is not everything that God approved of or permitted that is in His perfect will. He allowed certain things over a period of time, while He works towards drawing man\u2019s attention to His eventual perfect plan. We see this in Israel asking for a king like every other nation. That wasn\u2019t God\u2019s perfect plan for Israel. He allowed it and gave them King Saul. We know that God\u2019s perfect plan is for God to be king over them, a plan that He would still bring to pass in the future, through Jesus Christ. In fact, God called Ishmael, the son of the bondwoman. Ishmael was born according to the flesh, while Isaac was born according to a divine approval Galatians 4; 21-26.\n\nIn fact, God did not reckon Ishmael as the son of Abraham, even though He blessed him. This is what God said to Abraham in Genesis 22; 2 \u201cPlease take your son, your ONLY ONE (italics mine), whom you love, Isaac\u201d. God needed to make the clarification so Abraham would not be confused. God saw Isaac, as Abraham\u2019s ONLY son, even though Abraham first had Ishmael, in disobedience to God.\n\nYou could also see the disputes that arose from that polygamous infraction in the life of Abraham and Sarah. We also see what the birth of Ishmael from an ungodly alliance has brought to Israel and the world. The fate of Ishmael was prophesied by an Angel of the God in Genesis 16: 12. It says \u201cYou shall call his name Ishmael because the Lord has heard your affliction. He shall be a wild man; His hand shall be against every man, and every man\u2019s had against him\u2026\u201d\n\nThe same happened to David. In fact, God was annoyed with David for his adultery and the child of that adultery died, because God wanted it so, even though David married other wives, according to Moses' Law.\n\nSolomon who married many wives went out of God\u2019s will and committed all sorts of evil deeds because of his many wives. This is what God said of Solomon because of his many wives. 1 Kings 11 \u201cHe had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been\u201d. In fact, God was angry with Solomon 1 Kings 11:9. Solomon did not obey his father David 1 Kings 22: 3.\n\nThat God allowed some Old Testament people to marry many wives did not mean that God wanted it so. God allowing you to do something does not mean He desires it so, or that is His perfect plan for you.\n\nWhen you read the many cases of Polygamy in the Old Testament you would find out that the practice created unmitigated sociological disaster, as it still does today; creating heartbreaks and sowing family discords.\n\nAgain, we should note though that some Old Testament Fathers disobeyed God in the area of marriage, and God allowed it, which is not an excuse that God endorses polygamy in the New Testament dispensation. The NT brought in God\u2019s mind marriage and the way all believers in Christ should conduct themselves regarding marriage and relate to the marriage institution. Jesus said that because of their hardened heart, Moses, through God's permission in the Old Testament Law, allowed His people, the Israelites to marry more than one wife and give them permission to divorce, with its imperfections and the troubles it brought those who engaged in it.\n\nWe see that God, often always tried to point us back to His original order. We see that In Malachi; where God clearly showed that He desired covenanted Monogamy. It is instructive that God reminded us again of His perfect plan for marriage at the end of the Old Testament scriptures, that is Malachi when He was about to introduce the Perfect Son who would show His perfect way; that is Jesus beginning from the book of Matthew. This is what Malachi 2: 13- 16: \u201cAnother thing you do: You flood the Lord\u2019s altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer looks with favor on your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands. You ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d It is because the Lord is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.\n\n\u201cHas not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek, Godly offspring? So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.\n\n\u201cThe man who hates and divorces his wife,\u201d says the Lord, the God of Israel, \u201cdoes violence to the one he should protect,\u201d says the Lord Almighty.\n\nSo be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful.\u201d What could be clearer, Mr. Omokri? The book of Malachi is the last book that ended the OT scriptures and introduced us to the gospels, even though Jesus lived in the OT era. Now, God through Malachi drew the attention of the Israelites, and thus ours, to His perfect plan concerning marriage. Marriage, in the plan of God, as first stated in Genesis 2: 24, is a covenant. The man and the woman are to stay faithful to it. More especially the man, who is required not to deal treacherously in the marriage pact but to stay faithful to the wife (not WIVEs) of his youth. How does one stay unfaithful to the wife of his youth? It is by not going behind her to marry another wife, joining him with another woman, and not committing adultery.\n\nThen we see Jesus taking on the same theme of the sanctity of the marriage institution as God envisaged and required it. He began to introduce us to the NEW Life, the NEW WAY OF LIVING in God, by giving us the divine ability, through His Grace, to live according to God\u2019s ways; the way God designed man to live before the fall of Adam and Eve when lust had not come into humanity.\n\nThis is what Jesus said in Mark 10: 5 or Matthew 19: 3- 10: \u201cBecause of the hardness of your hearts he (Moses) wrote you this precept. But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and Female. For this reason, a man shall leave his wife (not wives), and the two (not three) shall become one flesh\u201d Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate. He said to them \u201cwhoever divorces his wife and marries commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery. See the reaction of the Pharisees in verse 10; \u201cIf such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry\u201d. It was hard saying and difficult deal to fallen and lustful man.\n\nNow, I read Reno saying that Jesus' remark in Mark 10: 5-9 relates to divorce only. Let's analyse it contextually and deductively.\"\n\nIn the above statement by Jesus, He was referring to Gen 2: 24, which we have referenced.\n\nNow this is what that scripture says: \"For this reason, a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh\"\n\nYes, Jesus was responding to the question of divorce, that was asked him when He made reference to that scripture. Reno should have known that the original text in Gen 2: 24 was not discussing divorce but the union between man and woman in marriage. Jesus used the occasion of that question of divorce to bring out the sanctity of marriage and how it should be contracted and upheld as planned by God in the beginning. But now the hardness of men's hearts made God wink at that disorder and subsequently allowed Moses to rule on it in the OT. It is perfect and logical reasoning that we assign to that text its original context and application before the secondary application, that of not violating the marriage union or covenant or pact between One Man and One Woman with adultery and divorce. Because when a man and a woman are joined together, they become one flesh. When a divorce takes place the Union has been disrupted. It is the same way with violating the sanctity of the union with adultery.\n\n1 Timothy 3: 2 spoke about the sanctity of marrying one wife. The scripture says a Bishop or Deacon must be blameless, a husband of one. That scripture should not be understood to mean that it relates to bishops alone and that those who would not be bishops could marry more than one wife. That would be absurd. It would go contrary to Jesus' Marriage template. Note that the first criteria are that a bishop should be BLAMESS, so in the scrutinizing of a church member that would be a bishop the person must be seen as someone who had not played around, who may have divorced, and married another woman. He must be one who has the history one who has and is married to one wife alone. Not one who had married a wife and divorced and married another wife, at this point. He must be blameless in the marriage institution.\n\nThe idea of one man and one wife was also exemplified for us in the description of Jesus as the husband of ONE Wife, not TWO. The Church here is referred to as a wife in Ephesians 5, and Paul also quoting Jesus and Genesis 2: 24 ended that text by saying \u201cNevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his OWN WIFE (not wives) as himself, and let the wife sees that she respects her husband\u201d. So, we who are of Him should exemplify him by marrying just one wife, and not two.\n\nTo avoid fornication and deal with those who could not control their lust and burning passion, Paul advised in 1 Corinthians 7 for Christians to marry (One wife, not two).\n\nWe have seen that when men began to lust after the daughters of men they began to take of all whom they chose. Marrying more than one wife is a product of lust; of the fallen state of man. When Adam and Eve sinned humanity began to disobey God's order; man became lustful. Ojukokore (lusting) entered the world. There are behaviours in the Old Testament that God winked at, according to scripture. According to Jesus, there is a way God intended the relationship between man and woman to be, but the hearts of fallen men made God wink at some of the behaviours of men in the OT days, but in Christ, He now commands all men to return to the state of obedience to God's order and ways. Now, this has nothing to do with traditions of men, which mostly are derived from the fallen state of man\u2019s heart; the state of disobedience to God\u2019s order. We are discussing God\u2019s perfect order; God\u2019s perfect life, which Jesus came to reenact and preach about, which the apostles were devoted to and expanded and gave more light. A heart or soul that is free from lust, which is a sin against God, will not seek a second wife; he would loath polygamy. He would see marriage as God intended it and not the way traditions of men or how the early Patriarchs in their imperfect way viewed marriage.\n\n\n\nUkodie is a journalist\n\n\n\n",

Ango and his northern elders do not have the power to kill and bury zoning; if they want to kill and bury Nigeria, then we are ready for them.\u201d\n\nOn the comment by Adamu, the SMBLF said it would be \u201coutright dishonesty and chicanery\u201d if the party refuses to zone its presidential ticket to the south.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho are they trying to deceive and who will allow them? It becomes even more upsetting given the fact that the statement came from someone who himself emerged as national chairman of the APC through the policy of rotation and zoning,\u201d the forum said.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, the APC Constitution, under article 7, relating to its aims and objectives, commits the party to firstly, \u2018promote and foster the unity, political stability and national consciousness of the people of Nigeria\u2019. The question then is would the dumping of the zoning policy foster unity, political stability and national consciousness in Nigeria?\u201d\n\nThe group also urged the southern governors and other stakeholders in the region to remain resolute in their call for a president from the zone.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, strongly caution all our governors, former governors and top politicians not to accept the Vice Presidency nomination from any northern presidential candidate,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe urge the 17 Southern Governors, who unanimously declared that the presidency must come to the south in May last year, at Asaba, Delta State, to remain resolute. They have our absolute support for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum and we stand firmly by them. This country belongs to all of us!\n\n\u201cLet everybody take this as a serious warning that the issue of zoning cannot be swept under the carpet; it cannot be dead and buried. If zoning is buried, Nigeria is then buried.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd if they are thinking that this is a joke, let it be known that it is not. If we cannot abide by the established principle of rotation and zoning between the north and south, then we should not continue with one Nigeria; we should go back to what we were as a people before the amalgamation of 1914.\n\n\u201cWe also earnestly call on the people of the Middle Belt Region and all minorities in Nigeria to wake up and work conscientiously with the southerners. If we do, the prospects will be pellucid. This was demonstrated at the National Conference of 2014 to the mortification of those who think this country belongs to them alone.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) says it will amount to \u201cdeceit\u201d if political parties refuse to zone their presidential tickets to the southern region.\nOn Thursday, Ango Abdullahi, the chairman of NEF, had said the next president should emerge through merit and not zoning.\nAdvertisement\u201cSMBLF says it is rather unfortunate and absurd that Ango Abdullahi and his Northern Elders Forum would make such twaddle.\n\u201cA few days ago, this same Ango fumbled with the idea of a so-called consensus arrangement for northern presidential aspirants.\nThey have our absolute support for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum and we stand firmly by them.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

This was on my mind during the weekend. Initially, I had this great idea to buy pizza and continue the series I started about a month ago. Unfortunately, my health refused to cooperate.\n\nYou can\u2019t deny that your overall health is crucial. Besides, rest is essential no matter how much you love to work. Well, today is another holiday. Enjoy it by resting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRest is essential for enhanced mental health, increased focus and memory, a stronger immune system, decreased stress, improved mood, and even a faster metabolism.\n\nConsequently, by resting today, you are protecting your overall health. I genuinely care about you and wish you a restful week ahead. But if you don\u2019t rest, my care will be for nothing. Please promise me you\u2019ll rest today.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nNALA\u2019s partnership with Cellulant\n\nMicrosoft Edge\u2019s free built-in VPN\n\nHow to remove personal information from Google Search\n\nNALA partners with Cellulant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNALA, a Tanzanian cross-border payments company, has partnered with Cellulant, a Kenyan payments company, to facilitate remittance payments from the UK and US into Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ghana.\n\nWhat exactly does this imply? Cellulant and NALA\u2019s partnership will promote seamless cross-border payments and cut the cost of sending money from the UK and the US into Africa.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Africa received around $48 billion in remittances, with Nigeria getting roughly half of this amount, followed by Ghana and Kenya. But transaction costs consume a significant portion of the billions sent to Africa each year.\n\nSending money into Africa has the highest expense of any region. Tanzania and Kenya continue to be the most expensive, with costs of 17% and 21% for every $200 transferred, respectively.\n\nWith rising intra-African trade and trade between Africa and the rest of the globe, one of the challenges to success in facilitating cross-border payments is transaction cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does NALA do? NALA, which was founded in 2018 by Benjamin Fernandes (CEO and Founder), enables cross-border payments from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union to Africa.\n\nWhat about Cellulant? Cellulant was launched in 2002 as a music streaming platform that allowed musicians to earn a percentage of the money fans paid to download their tracks.\n\nThe music streaming platform was then rebranded as a fintech company, delivering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners over time.\n\nWhy did Cellulant partner with Cellulant? Per NALA\u2019s COO, Nicolai Eddy, \u201cCellulant is one of the early payment pioneers on the continent, and we chose to partner with them because of their deep expertise in the space and their strong technical capabilities.\u201d\n\nCellulant has offices in 18 countries and a payments platform connecting thousands of businesses with 257 payment choices in 35 countries. The platform facilitates payments for 200 million customers on a single inclusive network, allowing interoperability across Africa.\n\nOn the other hand, NALA is currently present in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Ghana and plans to expand into Nigeria and Ethiopia. The company plans to spread its services throughout Africa, the United States, and Canada.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show you the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your tickets here.\n\nMicrosoft Edge\u2019s free built-in VPN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your preferred web browser? Google Chrome? Microsoft Edge? Internet Explorer (IE)? Haha! What century do you live in if you use IE?\n\nAnyway, if you still use IE, start preparing for its demise because Microsoft announced in May 2021 that it would be phased out on June 15, 2022.\n\nBesides, keep in mind that as IE\u2019s market share was steadily declining \u2014 Google Chrome dominates other browsers with a 69% market share \u2014Microsoft was developing Microsoft Edge to replace Internet Explorer.\n\nI guess now it\u2019s a good time to revisit this: Why some Nigerians might not miss Internet Explorer but would use Microsoft Edge\n\nWith IE about to give up the ghost, Microsoft announced that it is adding a free built-in virtual private network (VPN) service to its Edge browser to boost security and privacy.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft is testing the Cloudflare-powered VPN service, called \u201cEdge Secure Network,\u201d and claims it will make it available to the public as part of a security upgrade.\n\nWhen enabled, Edge Secure Network should encrypt users\u2019 online traffic, preventing internet service providers from collecting browsing information you\u2019d rather keep secret, like health-related searches or weird questions.\ud83d\ude09\n\nThe new function will also allow users to conceal their location by browsing the web using a virtual IP address. This also means that users will be able to access content that is restricted in their own countries, like Netflix shows.\n\nBut there is a catch: Data consumption is limited to 1GB each month, and users must have a Microsoft account so the company can track their usage.\n\nAlso, the feature is still under development and not yet accessible for early testing.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Now, you can ask Google to avoid showing specific URLs that point to information that could lead someone to your house or give them access to your accounts.\n\nWhy? This is to prevent the exploitation of private information, particularly in cases of financial fraud and doxxing \u2014 contact information shared with malicious, threatening, or harassing intent.\n\nAlso, Google will remove things like \u201cnon-consensual explicit or intimate personal images,\u201d pornographic deepfakes or Photoshops featuring your likeness, or links to sites with \u201cexploitative removal practices.\u201d\n\nHow do you make a removal request? Go to the topic\u2019s support page, scroll halfway down, and click the blue \u201cStart removal request\u201d button.\n\nFirst off, you\u2019ll be asked if you have contacted the website\u2019s proprietors. This is not required, so select \u201cNo, I prefer not to.\u201d When Google asks what you want to delete, for example, choose \u201cPersonal info, like ID numbers and private documents.\u201d\n\nThen you can specify what type of personal information is showing up in Google Search, like your contact details or driver\u2019s license. The second question asks if the request is related to doxxing.\n\nFollowing that, Google asks for your full name, country of residence, and email address. Takedown requests may only be submitted for results belonging to yourself or someone you formally represent.\n\nAttach a screenshot to your request that shows where your personal information appears on the web page. You will be asked to list relevant search terms at the end of the form, like your complete name and maiden name.\n\nBefore completing and submitting the removal request, you are allowed to provide further information. After you submit, Google will give you an automated email confirmation.\n\nWhen it receives removal requests, it will review all content on the web page to ensure that it is not interfering with the availability of other information that is widely helpful, like news items.\n\nThe search giant will also check to determine if the content is part of the public record on the websites of government or official sources. In such cases, they will not remove it.\n\nPlease take note: Removing content from Google Search does not remove it off the Internet, so you may want to contact the hosting site directly if you\u2019re comfortable doing so.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n\u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nMaking sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nHow a search for infinite learning led Justin Irabor to the world of computer science\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, I watched The Smart Money Woman, and I believe there are many Zuris out there, regardless of gender, race, religion, or employment.\n\nFirst off, who is Zuri? The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate. Since its launch, Eden Life has provided over 150,000 services in Nigeria.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Prosper Otemuyiwa, and Silm Momoh co-founded the company in Nigeria in 2019. It connects busy professionals with concierge services, and a subscription service that delivers high-quality chef-prepared meals, laundry services, and house cleaning.\n\nComing in with a twist: Unlike Lagos, Nairobi users get an additional service: a beauty and wellness service.\n\nWhat you should know about Lynk: The platform was launched in 2015, and it facilitated over 150,000 jobs, transferring $4.5 million to over 2,000 workers across four major verticals: beauty & wellness, cleaning & care, installation, repair & maintenance, and furniture & decor.\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePort 365, an African digital freight forwarding company, has raised $5 million in seed funding to drive end-to-end digitisation of freight management in Africa and support its expansion into new markets.\n\nLed by Mobility 54 \u2014 VC arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group \u2014 SBI Investment, Flexport, ODX, a Singaporean syndicate fund, Samurai Incubate, and other angel investors participated.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do? Launched in 2019 by Hio Sola-Usidame (CEO), the platform covers air freight, ocean freight, inland haulage (trucking, barge, and rail), and Pay-As-You-Go warehousing, marine insurance, customs brokerage, and more.\n\nCurrently, OnePort 365 is creating an operating system for African cross-border trade, assisting traders in managing their freight processes via a digital platform that enables seamless freight forwarding and other value-added services.\n\nAccording to OnePort 365, traders no longer have to wait up to two weeks to compare the best rates from various service providers. They can explore competitive offers on the platform and book freights in 30 seconds or less using pre-negotiated rates.\n\nIt currently operates in Nigeria and Ghana, and is exploring other markets. The platform also makes use of advancements in payment technology and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to enable instant payments.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve efficiency and lower overheads in cross-border trading across the continent, and to launch several new services that will boost overall profitability.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost immediately after it was announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, the price of Dogecoin (DOGE), the cryptocurrency Musk often promotes on social media, increased nearly 14%. Several days after the announcement was made Dogecoin\u2019s price continued to rise \u2013 up to 26% \u2013 peaking at $0.1675. But Dogecoin wasn\u2019t the only crypto to see a spike in its price after Twitter accepted Musk\u2019s bid to buy the company. Mushe (XMU) also saw a rise in its price. Mushe\u2019s price has grown 44% over the past seven days as the popularity of the token continues to grow in the presale. Another community-centric crypto, Dogelon Mars (ELON) also saw an initial spike of over 10% before settling down to see a modest rise of 0.64% the day after the announcement. As of the time of writing, the prices have settled and returned to their normal levels, but Mushe has remained strong and held its price.\n\nThe Elon Musk effect on cryptocurrency\n\nMusk\u2019s \u201cmidas touch\u201d has heavily benefited community-centric cryptocurrencies. Thanks to Musk\u2019s frequent mentions of Dogecoin, he single-handedly helped push the coin to \u201cthe moon\u201d as it reached a record high of $0.73 last year. In a tweet from April 2021, Musk called himself the \u201cDogefather\u201d a play on his fondness for the cryptocurrency. Musk\u2019s preference for the coin is summed up in five words from his February 2021 tweet which he wrote, \u201cDogecoin is the people\u2019s crypto.\u201d The price increases of Dogecoin align almost perfectly with Musk\u2019s tweets. After tweeting that Tesla would start accepting Dogecoin as payment for branded products, the price of the coin increased by 33% according to CoinGecko.\n\nMusk is one of the biggest buyers of crypto, with Tesla investing about $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency in 2021. Musk\u2019s influence in the crypto space is heavily felt. Currently, Dogecoin is the only digital currency Tesla accepts. The items eligible for purchase with Dogecoins include Tesla-branded belt buckles and children\u2019s all-terrain vehicles. All popular items that usually sell out quickly.\n\nHow investors can take advantage of the rise in community tokens\n\nWhen Mushe launched its tokens for presale on April 18, the price was $0.005 per token. Now, similar to Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, Mushe has seen a significant jump in its price. As of the time of writing, Mushe is priced at $0.019 per token. This is a great time for crypto enthusiasts and investors to purchase Mushe tokens as there are a limited number of tokens available and the price is expected to continue to increase beyond the July 4th launch date.\n\nBoth Dogecoin and Mushe are community-centric cryptocurrencies that are truly decentralized. Mushe has limitless scalability and interoperability. Token holders can safely, easily and quickly complete transactions via compatible wallets and exchanges such as the forthcoming Mushe Wallet and MusheSwap platforms. MusheSwap allows investors to trade on multiple blockchains without any restrictions and with low transaction fees.\n\nDogecoin and Mushe were founded on the principle of allowing people true financial freedom. The community of people that support both cryptocurrencies believe in the mission as well. They are committed to being a community that helps support the adoption and growth of the digital currencies.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration: https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeFi is the height of cryptocurrency, as a novel application, it is being said among cryptocurrency buffs that DeFi is the replacement of traditional banking, and the truth is, how can you not believe that? Pioneering borderless payment, using the blockchain and bypassing gatekeepers through the use of the blockchain. DeFi has moved from being a cryptocurrency thing to being a real contender and an example of what banking can be.\n\nSince Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is based on secure distributed ledgers which is akin to the systems used by cryptocurrencies, it can bypass Central Banks and other institutions that serve as barriers in the traditional banking system. There are a lot of entrants into the DeFi space, including tokens like Ripple and Fantom, these tokens were some of DeFi\u2019s frontrunners, however, DeFi is getting re-DeFi\u2019ned. Logarithmic Finance is set to become a big name.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nComing into the cryptocurrency space in the year 2013, Ripple (XRP) had the advantage of early entry. It fell quickly into contention and rose into the top ten of all cryptocurrencies in the world by the end of the year. It has since then gone on to make great gains, however, a few shadows follow Ripple (XRP). The organisation behind it was locked in a legal stalemate for the better part of 2021, the class action filed in December of 2020 stagnated the all-time high of Ripple at $3.84.\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nFantom is another of DeFi\u2019s hot tokens, at $1.07 per token, Fantom (FTM) is outside of the crypto top 10 by the ranking of Market Capitalization. Fantom (FTM) uses the proof of stake method of validation and it has been stated by some as the most suitable replacement for Ethereum (ETH). This is a high goal that it is yet to live up to despite having spent ample time in the market.\n\nThe light, scalable nature of Fantom (FTM) makes it a token to reckon with. This token is quite established now. Perhaps its time for a fresh face, Logarithmic Finance.\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG)\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG) comes packed with promise. It is a layer-3 switching protocol that intends to deliver the moving of financial assets at ease across borders, blockchains and languages. Logarithmic Finance (LOG) will boast a cross and multichain system that will allow financial assets to be generated and moved across any major blockchain network that will include the Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain, Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystems.\n\nThis singular use case, when implemented will be a potential winning principal that will push Logarithmic Finance to the forefront of DeFi. At the moment, the code of the project is in the works and is being reviewed independently by Certik. Logarithmic Finance (LOG) is also interoperable and open source, with a public-driven and highly spirited drive towards overall development, the coin has a lot of potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass adoption from the prelaunch state means that there should be enough investors holding the coin by the time it goes public. This will drive appeal, access and use cases as others will be willing to use it too. This could circumnavigate the issues that Fantom (FTM) is currently facing.\n\nWith all of these promises, it is an absolute steal to have Logarithmic Finance (LOG) at a locked presale of $0.10. The potential truth is that at no other time will the Logarithmic Finance (LOG) cryptocurrency be cheaper than it is today. Everything is in place, DeFi is going to see a massive shift and Logarithmic Finance (LOG) looks like it could be the centre of it.\n\nFor more information, follow these accounts:\n\nPresale: https://presale.logarithmic.finance/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/LOGARITHMIC_FINANCE_OFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LOGARITHMIC_FI\n\nWebsite: https://LOGarithmic.finance/\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/logarithmic_finance?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

We will link education with street begging and street children.\n\n\u201cIn the next few weeks or months, we will not allow street begging in Edo anymore. We have farm settlements and we need hands and labour to cultivate foods. People arrested from where they are begging will be evacuated to the farm settlements to work and if they don\u2019t want to work, they will be sent back to where they come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just employed 3,062 teachers in the rural communities as they have just finished their training. We will make sure those hard-to-reach areas in the riverine communities will have teachers to teach the children. We are training them now to work in those communities,\u201d he added.\n\nCharging the Muslim faithful on tolerance, Obaseki stated, \u201cWe all must learn to be tolerant to be able to overcome the economic pressure in the land.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we will never deceive our people because the people gave us power through the electoral process to lead them.\n\n\u201cOur administration is working hard to create more jobs and opportunities for the people of the State and ensure life is better for them. We are also creating a peaceful environment, infrastructure and security to make the State safe.\u201d\n\nReassuring that his administration will continue to use resources of the state for the growth and development of Edo, the governor added, \u201cAs a government, we will continue to emphasize that government money is not for few politicians but for the generality of the public and will not be used for politicians but for the people. We will continue to work for the people of Edo State, not for a few politicians.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdulfatai Enabulele commended the governor for his developmental strides across all sectors of the state, hailing him for his efforts at ending street begging in the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

You also engaged in capacity building as you interchanged skills and made your colleagues here locally improve their knowledge. They have learned new ways of doing things. You have brought a new way of commitment and dedication to duty.\n\n\u201cYou have fulfilled your call of service to humanity as the team restored lives during this mission by providing free medical service.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the activities of ANPA in Edo State have helped the government rethink the issue of brain drain, adding, \u201cYou are in the position to help us tackle brain drain. This mission has been so helpful as I believe that we can do two missions per year. Your services to Edo people are invaluable to the healthcare regeneration of our state and country at large.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cTo transform or reform any healthcare system in the world, we must focus on the people. It\u2019s about the quality of human capacity and development. I am grateful to God that we have you. We need to organise ourselves to receive the value you are ready to give us.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ehanire has commended the collaboration between ANPA and the state government, noting, \u201cNigeria suffers from brain drains as the country\u2019s medical personnel have left to practice abroad. It\u2019s difficult to stop them despite several plans as it affects not only Nigeria but across the globe.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI applaud the plan for telemedicine which has been experimented in America during the COVID-19 era with the help of technology which became very useful over there. Technology allows for virtual consultation between experts in the Diaspora and their patients here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe would like to institutionalize such a relationship to enable us share knowledge and skills and begin to develop the health sector here in Nigeria. We are waiting for the signature of the president to create the National Health Insurance Commission that will make health insurance mandatory for all Nigerians and increase the physical space for health.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "UBA ends Q1, 2022 on strong note amid turbulence",
          "text": "Okey Onyenweaku\n\nUBA has once again shown consistency in posting strong performance in its first quarter ended March 2022 outlook. From a comfortable position in the year end 2021, the pan African institution has raked in N44.484 billion, representing 8.76 per cent over the N40.581billion in 2021. Its Net interest income advanced by 14.10% from N74.38 billion to N84.87 billion in the current period.\n\nMarket observers admit that the banks growth rode on the back of incomes from interest, trading income and fees and commission income, which all appreciated year on year. Details show that net income from fees and commission rose 19.30 per cent to N24.30billion from N20.366billion in 2021.\n\nAt the end of business in the first quarter, the bank also grew its deposits from customers by 4.47% to N6.65 trillion while its total assets are now put at N8.89 trillion. At the same time, Net assets rose 2.60% to N825.75 billion.\n\nTotal operating expenses grew 20.4 per cent from N64.545 billion in 2021 to N77.642billion in 2022, Earnings per share for the period was reported as N1.14, a 9.62% increase from the N1.04 reported a year earlier in 2021.\n\nOverall, UBAs net operating income after impairments still appreciated by 16.33% to stand at N121.71 billion despite the 223 per cent spike in loan losses\n\nTo its credit, the bank harnessed and efficiently deployed its Electronic banking channel and raked in N15.11billion representing 21.04 per cent increase from N12.48million in Q1,2021.\n\nUBAs Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr Kennedy Uzoka, explained that despite the myriad of economic challenges on the global front which shaped the first three months of the year, the banks business model continued to show resilience.\n\nThese challenges among others, he noted include the ongoing crisis between Russia and Ukraine that has resulted in a huge supply shock, pushing up commodity prices; and the hike in the interest rates in most advanced countries aimed at tackling spiralling inflation, which has however sparked capital flow reversal from emerging and frontier markets.\n\nNotwithstanding these developments, we were able to leverage gains from our large customer base and vast geographical spread to bolster earnings. We recorded double-digit growth of 18 percent in our gross earnings to N183.9 billion, with our Nigerian operation raking in 65 percent of the revenue while our operations in other countries accounted for the remainder, showing the diversity in our operations, Uzoka said.\n\nThe GMD pointed out that amid the Great Resignation wave that has seen a record number of employees across the globe quit their jobs, disrupting the performance of many businesses, UBA, in the last quarter of 2021, thoughtfully reviewed upwards, the salaries of its staff as part of broad measures to retain talents, adding, We believe our staff is part of our success story with their welfare as a top priority.\n\nThe tier 1 bank had also impressed its shareholders with its end of year performance in 2021\n\nAt the end of the 2021 financial year, UBAs Profit Before Tax was impressive with a 20.3 percent growth to N153.1 billion, compared to N127.3 billion at the end of the 2020 financial year; while Profit After Tax rose grew by 8.7 percent to N118.7 billion in 2021, compared to N109.2 billion recorded the previous year.\n\nAs a result, the Bank proposed a final dividend of 80 kobo for every ordinary share of 50 kobo for the financial year ended December 31, 2021, bringing the total dividend for the year to N1.00 as the Bank had earlier paid an interim dividend of 20kobo.\n\nIn the last five years UBA has expanded in all measurement indicators. In the area of profit before tax, the bank posted a profit of about 50 per cent in the last five years from 2017 to 2021.\n\nWhile its Profit Before tax grew from N104.2billion in 2017 to N106.76billion in 2018, N111.28billion in 2019, N127.25billion in 2020 and N153billion in 2021.\n\nThe lender (Company) has remained formidable in the midst of all odds.\n\nIn fact, the previous years its strong performances have also provided a sturdy base for the vigour and strength which the lender has displayed.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the bank which has shown vigour and promise.\n\nOne significant thing about UBA is that it has long left its contemporaries behind and remained a leader.\n\nUBA has paid dividend in 2021. I will take it from the historical perspective. UBA was one of the three old dominant banks and among them, I mean Union Bank and First bank have been seriously troubled to the point that they fallen down the pecking order. Union Bank and First Bank rubbing shoulders with the tire 2 and 3 banks .\n\nBut UBA has remained entrenched as a tier 1 bank. That shows that the bank is resolute and has continued to grow from strength to strength. For several years it has been bedeviled by the kind of challenges that have burdened the other banks.\n\nThough it has its own internal problems. But it has been able to weather the storm. It has been able to do that because of the kind of re-invigorated leadership that one person has brought to the table and that is Tony Elumelu. Tony has kept that pedigree and has been able consolidate the bank, making a very vibrant and competitive brand.\n\nThen their cross border expansion has added huge value to the bank. The bank is now entrenched in the international arena, I think for that bank the sky is its limit, especially now that there is AFCTA, the African continental trade area which will push most African countries to trade more among themselves. Most of those transactions will run through banks and UBA is one of the banks that is positioned to benefit from that trade, said Adonri\n\nKey highlights of its results\n\n\u00a7 The Nigerian lender earned N125.08 billion from its lending business as Interest income grew by 15.18% from N108.59 billion.\n\n\u00a7 Despite a 223% spike in loan losses, net operating income after impairments still appreciated by 16.33% to stand at N121.71 billion.\n\n\u00a7 The bank, however, grew its net income from fees and commission rising 19.30% to N24.30 billion year on year.\n\n\u00a7 .\n\n\u00a7 The bank also made Income from the disposal of property, dividends, rental, and cash handling, which raked in a total of N1.76 billion.\n\n\u00a7 The banks Electronic banking income raked in N15.11 billion, representing a 21.04% increase from N12.48 million in Q1 2021, indicating that the bank has efficiently utilized its use of electronic banking channels to deliver financial services to its consumers.\n\n\u00a7 Trade transactions income for the Q1 2022 period grew by 109.19% from N7.42 billion in the corresponding period of 2021 to N3.55 billion.\n\n\u00a7 In addition, the bank also grew its deposits from customers by 4.47% to N6.65 trillion while its total assets are now N8.89 trillion. Net assets rose 2.60% to N825.75 billion.\n\nUnited Bank for Africa Plc last traded at N8.10 per share and its market capitalization stood at N277.02 billion as of Tuesday, April 26, 2022. Year-to-date performance shows that the share price of the company has appreciated by 0.62%.\n\nThe bank recently paid a final dividend per share of N0.80 per share, to its eligible shareholders, for the period ended December 31, 2021. The dividend was paid to the shareholders on April 7, 2022.",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nKidnapping and banditry the Siamese twin disturbing the peace of Nigeria has now become normal, a day can hardly pass without one incident or another.\n\nSome kidnapped victims of the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna train attack are still with the kidnappers with government still in limbo on the best strategy to adopt to rescue victims.\n\nFor the victims of the numerous kidnap incidents which daily occur it has become a case of to your tents oh Israeli, meaning that individuals have to sort out themselves from the grip of kidnappers by negotiating with the kidnappers and paying the ransom.\n\nPresident Buhari and his security architecture have lost the war and battles on security the government\u2019s response has become stock in trade: government will deal decisively with the bandits, an expression which has assumed meaningless toga in the eyes of the public.\n\nBuhari had again reiterated the resolve of his administration to deal ruthlessly with criminal elements creating security challenges in the country. He made the assertion in the aftermath of the train attack.\n\nTo this end, President Buhari said that he had directed the nations Armed Forces and other security services to deal decisively with any person or group undermining efforts at achieving sustainable peace, security and stability in the country, assuring that the country will ultimately defeat the forces of evil.\n\nThere have been series of security meetings with the service chiefs and the inspector general of police , even as recent as last week; yet the president is yet to win the war on banditry.\n\nSpeaking at the palace of Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Saad Abubakar III, President Buhari in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, said: I gave them specific orders not to spare any bandit or terrorist threatening the lives and property of innocent Nigerians.\n\nThe President, who commiserated with the Government and people of Sokoto over the recent loss of lives and property as a result of outrageous attacks by bandits and other criminal gangs, assured the people that he remains unrelenting in his resolve to put an end to heinous criminal activities in the state and other parts of the country.\n\nThe President wrote in the visitors register: My condolences to the Sultanate, the Government, and people of Sokoto State over the recent mindless killings by bandits and terrorists.\n\nThe insecurity in the country is unprecedented, says professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist. \u201d I can\u2019t understand the mindset of this administration. It is an unexplained mystery that government knows the sponsors of insecurity and yet is afraid to name and bring them to justice\u201d, he told Business Hallmark.\n\nHours after 60 vigilantes reportedly died from bandits attack in communities in Sakaba/Wassagu LGA of Kebbi State in March, President Muhammadu Buhari commiserated with the state and promised to intensify his administrations effort to defeat the monsters.\n\nA day after he made the promise, bandits were reported to have massacred 16 soldiers, one policeman and an unspecified number of civilians in the area.\n\nThe latter attack occurred when the state Deputy Governor Samaila Yombe paid a condolence visit to Kanya, one of the communities where the bandits had killed scores of vigilantes.\n\nYombe, a retired colonel, was accompanied by the Commanding Officer, Zuru Army Barracks, in the state when the assailants felled many of the soldiers in his escort and other civilians. The deputy governor escaped by a whisker.\n\nSince he assumed office on May 29, 2015, Buhari has issued scores of condolences in reaction to attacks by terrorists, bandits and other gunmen.\n\nThe tradition always goes with assurances that the end of the criminals is near.\n\nBuhari inherited a security-compromised nation from his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, but many pundits believe the situation has not improved, but worsened.\n\nThe presidents condolences usually come from either his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina or his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu.\n\nDespite his assurances to end the menace, attacks keep recurring, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people in the country yearly.\n\nChecks by Business Hallmark showed that Buhari had issued more than a dozen condolences to families of victims of attacks in the country in the past 12 months.\n\nSimilarly, a report credited to SBM Intelligence, an Africa-focused geopolitical research firm, says Nigeria lost 10,366 persons to insecurity in 2021.\n\nDateline of condolences in the last 12 months -March 2021 to March 2022\n\nOn March 9, the president commiserated with families of scores of vigilante members who were ambushed and killed by bandits in the Sakaba/Wassagu Local Government Area Kebbi State the previous day.\n\nBandits had attacked communities in Tsafe Local Government Area in Zamfara State on January 23, killing nine.\n\nTwo months before then, the gunmen had killed 14 people in the state. Attacks on the state have been persistent, and they always come with high casualties and abductions for ransom.\n\nBuhari promised to visit the state on January 27. He never did. He blamed the failure on poor weather. He then sent a video of his broadcast containing his governments assurances to defeat the criminals and sympathy to the state.\n\nOn December 13, while receiving the governor of Sokoto State, Amina Tambuwal, who visited to brief him of the security situation in his state at the State House, the president sympathised with the people of the state over attacks by bandits and restated his commitment to ending the menace.\n\nHe had commiserated with the state three days before then over gunmens attack on the state.\n\nOn January 27, the president again gave the assurance on the return to peace while commiserating with the Sultan of Sokoto over the loss of lives and property by bandits and other criminal gangs in the state.\n\nIn the Sultan visitors register, the president wrote: My condolences to the Sultanate, the Government, and people of Sokoto State over the recent mindless killings by bandits and terrorists. Nigeria shall win the battle over evil.\n\nIn another message, the president commiserated with the bandits attack victims in Kaduna State on December 19.\n\nThe President reiterated the administrations will to work with all members of the society to rid the country of terrorists, bandits and kidnappers, part of a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media & Publicity, Garba Shehu, read.\n\nOn September 29, Buhari commiserated with the family of the late Chike Akunyili, husband of the late Dora Akunyili, a former Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) who was murdered by gunmen.\n\nWhile charging the security agencies to strengthen efforts in fighting criminals, he vowed that the government would bring Akunyili killers to book.\n\nHe issued another condolence on August 30, following the death of captain Abdulkareem, the son of the senator representing Kebbi South, Bala Naallah, in Kaduna by gunmen.\n\nThe death of Abdulkareem is another tragic chapter in our current security challenges, but I reassure Nigerians that my commitment to protect the lives and property of all Nigerians remains unwavering, the president said in a statement signed by Garba Shehu.\n\nAbducted students of Afaka in Kaduna\n\nOn April 5, 2021, the president mourned the leader of the Myetti Allah group, Muhammed Husaini, who was among the persons murdered in Nasarawa State that month by gunmen.\n\nOn April 3, the president condemned terrorists attacks on communities in Ebonyi and Anambra states. He also commiserated with the victims relations.\n\nThe president also sympathised with relations of children abducted and those killed at the Government Science College, Kagara, Rafi Local Government, Niger State on February 17, 2021.\n\nThere are other condolence messages addressed to relations of individuals who were victims of vicious attacks in the country. An example is the late five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, who was reported to have been killed by her teacher in Kano.\n\nA report credited to SBM Intelligence, an Africa-focused geopolitical research firm, says Nigeria lost 10,366 persons to insecurity in 2021.\n\nAnother report noted that 14 people died daily because of insecurity the same year.\n\nAccording to the state government, in 2021, bandits killed 1,192 and kidnapped 3,348 people in Kaduna alone.\n\nThose kidnapped include 39 students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, in the state in April.\n\nTimeline of killings in 2021\n\nAbout 23 persons kidnapped by gunmen in April at the Greenfield University in Kaduna were part of the number.\n\nSimilarly, the government captured the 27 children whisked away from school by terrorists at the Government Science College, Kagara, Nigeria State in the data.\n\nIn July that year, gunmen stormed the Federal College Yauri, Kebbi State, and kidnapped an unspecified number of students.\n\nIt was widely reported how 175 soldiers and cops died in 72 attacks in the South-East within six months that year.\n\nIn October, bandits stormed a market in Sokoto State and killed 30 persons.\n\nThere have been bloodbaths resulting from insecurity in Niger, Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kaduna, Plateau, Benue, Borno, Ebonyi, Enugu, Abia, Imo, Anambra, Ondo, Ogun, among others.\n\nThe most recent trend in the nations insecurity is the killing for ritual, a practice that is rife in the South of Nigeria.\n\nAt 146th out of 163 nations, Nigeria ranked low on the global peace index in 2021.\n\nThe United Nations Children Fund said that year that one million children in Nigeria would miss school because of mass kidnapping.\n\nResults from Buharis efforts\n\nBuhari inherited a war-torn North-East of the nation from his predecessor. In recent months, hundreds of the terrorists have reportedly surrendered to the nations militarys superior powers.\n\nBut the rise in banditry, kidnapping in the North-West and killings in the South-East by gunmen, including other pockets of crisis in parts of the country, have frustrated the presidents campaign promise to restore peace to the nation.\n\nAnother report credited to ABC Analytics says between January and March, 2022 over 800 Nigerians have been killed by the bandits and about 40 are victims of ritual killing for money in Southern part of the country.\n\nDr Awotedu Agbaakin, a sociologist told this newspaper that \u201d the government has not only lost the battle but the war on insecurity.

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor/Rivers\n\nFormer representative of Rivers South East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Senator Magnus Abe, has insisted that he will contest for the primary of All Progressives Congress, APC for the selection of the party\u2019s governorship candidate for the state.\n\nAbe, who claimed that Rivers people contributed money to enable him purchase the \u2018Expression of Interest and Nomination form\u2019 for the gubernatorial ticket APC stated this while appearing on a live programme of ARISE Television Network in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nHe said Rivers people are more interested in effective governance that will return power to the people, rather than politics.\n\nThe Senator said: \u201cI have already purchased my form to run for the primary election in our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and it will interest you to know that Rivers people from all across, contributed money to support me to get that form.\n\n\u201cRivers people from every divide, every ethnic group, every political affiliation, every religious affiliation that you can think of, Muslims, Christians, people across the State. Some put in twenty thousand naira, some one million naira. They brought money to help me cross that barrier.\n\n\u201cI think that with that kind of background, the party members across the state have realized that I\u2019m one of their surest best to be able to cross that bridge when we actually get there.\n\n\u201cSecondly, let me also say that as far as I know what Rivers people are interested in at this point in time is not so much of politics, but in effective governance.\n\n\u201cThey want a governor that will devote his time to attending to their own needs and their own challenges.\n\n\u201cThey want a governor that understands their own problems that they face. You see like I was talking to our children the other day at the Rivers State University, when you are hungry in the school, nobody knows whether you are from Kalabari or Ogoni. When you don\u2019t have a job nobody knows whether you are from Ekpeye or Andoni. At that point our problems are the same.\n\n\u201cWhen people try to promote sentiment over reality, they are trying to use those sentiments to blind you to the reality of your situation.\n\n\u201cThe reality of our situation today in Rivers State is that we need to work together, we need to come together across political, ethnic privileges to be able to harness the vast and enormous economic potentials that Rivers State has. We need leaders that can bring that message of unity, that message of inclusion.\n\n\u201cWe need leaders that are humble enough to understand that being a governor is just a job, you are hired by the people to do the job.\n\n\u201cI have the tract record to enable Rivers people believe that when I say that, that is what it will be. That\u2019s why my candidacy is vibrating across the state not just within the APC but within the larger society, within all ethnic blocks and within groups in the state.\n\n\u201cI think that, this is the kind of message that Rivers people want to hear, they want a governor that will concentrate on the issues of Rivers State. A governor who understands that they are the reason this country was created and the reason why Rivers State exist.\n\n\u201cI think that my track record in politics and my interaction with the people of Rivers State gives them that confidence that I am the man who can get that job done. I think that a lot of the members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), despite our differences realize that I have the best chance to actually deliver the governorship to the people of Rivers State\u201d.\n\nSenator Abe recalled that since Rivers State was created in 1967, no Ogoni son or daughter has ever been a governor, deputy governor, Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly nor the Chief Judge, which according to him could not have been a coincidence.\n\nHe said, there are three senatorial districts in Rivers State, the Rivers West, Rivers East and Rivers South-East Senatorial Districts. But in all, only the Rivers South-East Senatorial District was yet to produce a governor.\n\n\u201cOgonis are of course the majority in that senatorial district, which is where I come from and in our party the All Progressives Congress (APC), the last time we met as a one united party, we zoned the governorship to Rivers South-East Senatorial District, which everybody knows that if you follow the rules of equity, justice and fairness that should be the senatorial district to produce the next governor of the state.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday tweeted for the first time after Twitter operations were formally restored in Nigeria.\n\nThe President in his first post greeted Muslims in Nigeria and across the world, on the successful end of Ramadan, and the commemoration of Eid-el-Fitr.\n\nThe Buhari-led government had on June 4, 2021, announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nTelecommunications companies started blocking access to Twitter on June 5, after they received a directive from the Nigerian Communications Commission to block access to Twitter.\n\nThe suspension by the Nigerian government came days after a post by Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform.\n\nThe government cited the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence as the reason for the suspension.\n\nAccording to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria\u2019s economy lost N104.02m ($250,600) every hour to the ban on Twitter as of December 2021.\n\nThe government, however, lifted the suspension on January 13, 2022.\n\nIn his first post after his return to the microblogging site, Buhari claimed his administration has been able to stem insecurity in the war-ravaged North-East Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAfter a period of fasting and reflection, this year, we have cause to welcome the occasion in hope. The battle waged against terrorists who falsely masquerade under the name of Islam is approaching its conclusion,\u201d he posted.\n\n\u201cThe fight has been long and hard. Final victory is within sight. Boko Haram and its offshoots\u2019 final embers are now fading. Last month, the leader of ISWAP was killed in an airstrike. Since the New Year, thousands of fighters have surrendered.\n\n\u201cThe territories they used to occupy are now seeing the return of those who were forced to flee their barbarity. Normality is finally beginning to return to the Northeast. It is a long process. Yet it is one we are, together, now embarking upon.\n\n\u201cWith the designation of bandit groups as terrorists, the challenges of banditry & kidnapping are being tackled differently in the North-West and North-Central where the latest military acquisitions and Armed Forces are being fanned out across the region to thwart acts of terror.\n\n\u201cThe administration is equally getting impressive reports of the special operations to curb crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering in the South-South, with millions of illegally refined products being impounded and illegal refineries destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhile we are making progress cleaning the environment, some evil people are busy causing more pollution and destruction.\n\nIn response to the disturbing rise in criminal attacks targeting law enforcement and public facilities in the South East, concerted military operations to rid the region of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN) elements have, in recent weeks, led to the overrunning of IPOB/ESN bases, the seizure of weapons and the arrest of a large number of suspects.\n\n\u201cI have recently approved the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta, Imo State, among other interventions to strengthen the security of lives, property and critical national infrastructure in the region.\n\n\u201cThe reinvigoration of the war against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking is also showing positive results as shown by the arrest of over 12,300 offenders including seven drug barons; the conviction of 1,400, counseling and rehabilitation of about 8,000 drug users.\u201d\n\nFollowing the ban, groups including the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, had dragged the government to the ECOWAS court.\n\nThe President\u2019s tweet comes a few days after one of the victims of the Kaduna-Abuja train attack gave birth at the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nThe victim was said to be eight months pregnant in March 2022 when she was abducted alongside others when bandits attacked the train.",

Therefore, our returning members will be expected to conduct themselves in a manner acceptable under our party\u2019s constitution, rules, and guidelines.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we remain proud of the landmark achievements of Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. He has not only kept faith with a kernel of his social contract with Lagosians, the THEMES agenda, he has returned the state to the path of steady progress. He has been a symbol of responsible, stable, responsive, humane, and humble leadership. He has indeed delivered on the policies and the politics\u201d.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nA renowned finance expert and Director of Statistics of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Mohammed Musa Tumala, today collected his Nomination Form at the All Progressive Congress (APC) Secretariat in Abuja to formally express his interest in the 2023 Senatorial elections in Borno State.\n\nTumala, in a chat with journalists shortly after collecting his nomination form, said that his returning to politics was informed by the need \u201cfor professionals to get involved in reversing the increasingly worrisome socio-economic hardships of the people in communities in the State through motivating the appropriate levels of ambition in youths and women, and build egos to help them find their purpose in life\u201d.\n\nThe aspirant, who though commended the efforts of the state governor, Babagana Zulum, for investing in critical infrastructure and capacity building of the youths in recent years despite insecurity challenge in the state, stressed that there remained much work to be done to \u201creally help the traumatized population by building a community of youths that could create a future for themselves and take full responsibility for their own fate, that will not only survive the challenges of today but prevail, succeed, and thrive. We want our youths to be prepared to identify opportunities and productively utilize luck\u201d.\n\nHe explained: \u201cAs we say, leadership is about service to the led. So, my interest to go back to politics after my career in the CBN is to demonstrate to the electorate in my senatorial communities that after darkness, there will be light.\n\n\u201cI have been there before to help them in terms of leading by example politically and I am now better prepared and more determined to proof that politics is about serving the interests of the people by using the opportunity availed by political authority to transform lives of the ordinary people, especially the poor and socio-economically excluded in our communities.\n\nLending credence to the aspirant\u2019s promises, a young man from Dr. Tumala\u2019s constituency who simply identified himself as Mallam Mustapha, told the journalists that \u201cthis is not the first time that our leader, Hon. Mohammed Tumala, is indicating his interest to serve us politically. He was elected before into the House of Representatives and he served us to be best of his ability.\n\n\u201cOur people are still talking about what he did then till today. So, our joining him to collect his nomination form is to show we are strongly behind him and will cast our votes for him come 2023, insha Allah\u201d, Mustapha assured.\n\nIt would be recalled that Dr. (Hon) Tumala had earlier been elected into the House of Representatives in 1992 and served until 1994 when the democratic regime was truncated by the military. Before then, he was a lecturer at the University of Maiduguri for 19 years.",

Today, April 30, 2022 is all about Nigerian youths. We are supporting Yahaya Bello for this and no one else. That he has the capacity to solve the problem of insecurity and a host of others facing the nation is not in doubt.\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of the country. We must give youths a chance, especially one that has demonstrated uncommon capacity, in the person of Yahaya Bello,\u201d he said.\n\nUwazuruike, who is also the Founder of Biafran Independent Movement, said that he does not believe in a president of Igbo extraction, insisting that the contest should be thrown open.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd that had come to welcome him at the APC Secretariat last Wednesday, Bello had said, \u201cRight now, what we have ahead of us is a task of canvassing and consulting all party faithfuls, leaders, delegates and stalwarts, members and all Nigerians, at home and even in the diaspora to support us so that we become the flagbearer of this great party come 30 and 31 of May 2022. And by the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.\u201d",

Doctor Farah Dagogo, from detention.Peterside, who said Hon. Dagogo\u2019s arrest has no locus standi in any known Nigerian Law or Statue, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act, described Wike as a neo-fascist and dictator desperate to gag free speech and democratic rights of Rivers citizens.\n\nHe challenged the governor to justify his reasons for the arrest of the lawmaker other than his quest to remain a political alpha and omega who would not brood any fair contest. While insisting that the police also erred in executing the arrest without a known court warrant of arrest, Peterside vowed that Rivers State would not allow Wike to prosper in his quest to turn the state into an Italy of Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism held sway until the world rallied democracy against them. \u201cRivers State cannot become an Italy of Benito Mussolini, or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism and dictatorship contracted an evil marriage of convenience that bestrode and muzzled free speech and fundamental rights of citizens. What Wike is working at is to annex every independent mind and cow every Rivers citizen into sheepish acquiescence. But what he plays ignorant of is that from the times of Dappa Biriye, Melford Okilo, Obi Wali, TImothy Birabi, all nationalists and Democrats, Rivers had never suffered fools to muzzle them. So, we shall keep to that historic attitude and would never surrender to Wike and his goons.\u201d\n\nPeterside, who is the immediate past Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, queried Gov. Wike on how he obtained evidence linking the lawmaker to an alleged disruption of proceedings at the Rivers State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. \u201cWike had lied at several times such that these days his claims must be subjected to forensic investigation before believed. So, Rivers people need know how he proved Dagogo\u2019s link to whatever happened at their party Secretariat\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile calling on lovers of democracy and free speech to condemn Wike and his fascist style of governance, Peterside reiterated his 48-hour ultimatum to Gov. Wike to order the release of the detailed lawmaker. \u201cWike has 48 hours to ensure that Honourable Farah is set free and allowed to continue to pursue his political aspiration. Nothing short of that shall avail. Wike cannot be junketing in pursuit of his presidential ambition using Rivers State resources while wickedly gagging another\u2019s on the altar of ego.

          "text": "Humanitarian organisations worked to evacuate more civilians from the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Monday but hundreds of people remained trapped in the Azovstal steel works, the last stronghold of resistance to the Russian siege.\n\nA first group of evacuees was due to arrive in a Ukrainian-held town northwest of Mariupol on Monday. But Russian forces resumed shelling the steel works on Sunday as soon as the buses had left the plant, a city official said.\n\nPeople still stuck there were running out of water, food and medicine as Russian forces hemmed them into the industrial complex, whose network of bunkers and tunnels has provided shelter from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\u201cThe situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.\n\nIntense Russian bombardments were also hitting towns in eastern Ukraine on Monday, causing severe damage, a regional governor said.\n\nOn the international front, EU energy ministers were due to hold emergency talks on Moscow\u2019s demand that European buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles or face their supply being cut off.\n\nWhile the EU has imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, the issue of Russian energy supplies has posed a dilemma that threatens to crack the united front.\n\nLOOKING EAST\n\nThe Russian military is now focusing on crushing resistance in Ukraine\u2019s south and east after failing to capture Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, now in its third month.\n\nIts assaults have flattened cities, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 5 million to flee the country. Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, has become emblematic of the brutality of the war and the suffering of ordinary people.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces are now in control of nearly all the city, linking up Russian-held territory to the west and east.\n\nAround 100 civilians evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks were due to arrive in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 230 km northwest of Mariupol, on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we had two days of a ceasefire on this territory, and we managed to take out more than 100 civilians \u2013 women, children,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address.\n\nFootage from inside the steelworks showed members of the Azov regiment helping civilians though rubble and on to a bus.\n\nBut hundreds remain trapped inside. One older evacuee accompanied by young children said survivors were running out of food.\n\n\u201cChildren always wanted to eat. You know, adults can wait,\u201d she said.\n\nRussia last week said it had decided against storming the steel works and would instead blockade it. But sporadic bombardments have continued.\n\n\u201cYesterday, as soon as the buses left Azovstal with the evacuees, new shelling began immediately,\u201d Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the Mariupol mayor, told Ukrainian television.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it was taking part in the evacuation operation along with the United Nations and Ukrainian and Russian officials.\n\nMore than 50 civilians arrived at a temporary accommodation centre in Russian-controlled territory on Sunday after escaping from Mariupol, a Reuters photographer said. read more\n\n\u2018UNTIL VICTORY\u2019\n\nMoscow calls its invasion a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and rid it of anti-Russian nationalism fomented by the West. Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression that threatens to spiral into a much wider conflict.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday Moscow only wanted to guarantee the security of pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east and was not demanding that Zelenskiy surrender as a condition for peace.\n\n\u201cOur aim does not include regime change in Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov said in an interview published on his ministry\u2019s website.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military said on Monday Russian forces were trying to take over the eastern town of Rubizhne and prepare an assault on Sievierodonetsk.\n\nLuhansk region Governor Serhiy Gaidai said three people had been killed by shelling over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe heaviest clashes were taking place around Popasna, to the west of the Russian-held regional capital. The shelling was so intense they could not even collect the bodies, he said.\n\n\u200b\u201dI don\u2019t even want to speak about what\u2019s happening with the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now. These cities simply don\u2019t exist anymore. They have completely destroyed them.\u201d\n\nLuhansk region Governor Serhiy Gaidai said three people had been killed by shelling over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe heaviest clashes were taking place around Popasna, to the west of the Russian-held regional capital. The shelling was so intense they could not even collect the bodies, he said.\n\n\u200b\u201dI don\u2019t even want to speak about what\u2019s happening with the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now. These cities simply don\u2019t exist anymore. They have completely destroyed them.\u201d\n\nMoscow is pushing for complete control of the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists already controlled parts of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces before the invasion.\n\nIn Russia, two explosions took place on Monday in Belgorod, a southern region bordering Ukraine, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. The cause of the blasts was not clear but the Kremlin has accused Ukraine of making cross-border attacks. Gladkov said there were no casualties.\n\nEU PONDERS MOVES\n\nIn Brussels, EU energy ministers were due to meet in a bid find a way out of the dilemma posed by Russian energy supplies, which count for 40% of EU gas and 26% of its oil imports.\n\nGermany and others have so far resisted calls for an abrupt halt to Russian fuel imports for fear of economic damage, while Moscow is demanding that European buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles or face their supply being cut off.\n\nRussia halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last week after they refused to meet its demand to effectively pay in roubles.\n\nDiplomats said the EU is edging towards a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year.\n\nBut German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday some countries were not yet ready for an embargo of Russian oil. Germany did not want to trigger an economic catastrophe, he said.",
