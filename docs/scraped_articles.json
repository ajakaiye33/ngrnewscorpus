          "text": "Watford striker Dennis Emmanuel is a serious doubt for Nigeria\u2019s friendly games against Mexico and Ecuador next month, PUNCH Sports Extra reports.\n\nThe striker is among the 30 Eagles players invited for the games against the Americans with the game against Mexico scheduled to hold at the AT & T Stadium in Dallas, State of Texas May 28, before flying to New Jersey to tackle Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison on June 2.\n\nThe friendly will serve as preparations for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sierra Leone at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on June 9 and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 & Pr\u00edncipe in Marrakech, Morocco on June 13.\n\nDennis was omitted from the Watford squad that played a goalless draw during their mid-week game against Everton.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Sunday\u2019s game against Leicester City, Roy Hodgson confirmed that the Nigerian has suffered a knee injury and has been ruled out of the Hornets\u2019 game.\n\n\u201cTom Cleverley has severely bruised ribs and then Sarr and Dennis with their knee injuries won\u2019t be risked. Those names, you can forget them,\u201d the manager was quoted as saying by Watford Observer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m really quite happy to give those boys that played the other night another go. I think if anything, they deserved it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not I\u2019m not crying or bleating about the situation there. I\u2019m actually quite looking forward to it. For me, watching the game the other night was one of the more enjoyable experiences I\u2019ve had, and one of the more pleasurable ones in the sense that I saw a team trying to play as a team and do all the things we\u2019ve tried to ask them to do as a team and doing it together. And doing it with plenty of determination and guts.\u201d\n\nThough the extent of the injury remains unknown, the news will come as a major concern for Salisu Yusuf as he prepares the team for the friendlies and AFCON qualifiers.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "I was racially abused for defending Iwobi \u2013 Kelechi Anyikude",
          "text": "Popular UK-based Nigerian Arsenal supporter Kelechi Anyikude in this interview with KELVIN EKERETE speaks about his high and low moments as a Gunner, influx of Nigerian players in the English Premier League as was his thoughts on Victor Osimhen joining the London club\n\nWhen did you become an Arsenal fan?\n\nI became an Arsenal fan in 1995 when Dennis Bergkamp moved to the club and everything got solidified when Nwankwo Kanu joined us in 1999 and I\u2019ve been supporting the club since then through thick and thin, home and away.\n\nWere you one of the fans that wanted Arsene Wenger to leave the club?\n\nI didn\u2019t. Some guys on Arsenal Fans TV did but I never said one bad word about Wenger and that\u2019s why anytime I run into him it\u2019s always cordial. I always thought he deserved the right to leave on his own accord after all he had done for the club.\n\nWenger did a lot for football in England; changed the culture at the club and seeing him go out like that was really sad.\n\nDo you support the Super Eagles?\n\n100 per cent. I\u2019m friends with most o the players and we interact as well. I try not to be too hard or critical with them and if I have something to say and I can reach you directly I do that. I encourage them a lot especially when the likes of Alex Iwobi were being overtly criticised and abused while he was at Arsenal and even at Everton, I always send him a message like \u2018bro keep your head up, we\u2019re here to support you, we know you can do better\u2019.\n\nI follow the Super Eagles games and it\u2019s a shame that we didn\u2019t qualify for the World Cup after all the banter I had with Ghanaian fans and it was another friend of mine, Thomas Partey, that scored the goal and since he did, I\u2019ve been avoiding him.\n\nI think it was a fair game, they deserved it and I hope they do well. Right now, however, I have switched my attention to the Super Falcons and their preparation for the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.\n\nWhat was the reaction of the Ghanaian fans to you after Nigeria\u2019s loss?\n\nThey came for me on my Twitter and Instagram but they knew it was all friendly and light-hearted jokes.\n\nI know that if Ghana wins at the World Cup we\u2019ll all celebrate them.\n\nHow does it make you feel seeing a lot of Super Eagles players in the EPL?\n\nIt makes me happy and people are now beginning to recognise that we have talents in the country. Watford for instance, I just didn\u2019t think they utilised the Nigerian players at their disposal. Aside from Emmanuel Dennis, they could have used Oghenekaro Etebo a lot in midfield.\n\nWilliam Troost-Ekong is a good player and while fighting relegation, some of these physical guys would have helped a lot. I also think it doesn\u2019t make any sense to draft in Samuel Kalu and not play him.\n\nAt Leicester City, Ademola Lookman and Kelechi Iheanacho are doing well, Wilfred Ndidi as well and he (Ndidi) not being at the World Cup qualifier and Iwobi not being there actually cost us more because there was no one to link up the plays.\n\nI\u2019m happy that the players are doing well and I pray that Iwobi and Everton don\u2019t get relegated because that will hurt me.\n\nWhen I have the time I go out to watch their games, especially that of Leicester because Iheanacho receives us well whenever we come to watch his team.\n\nWhich Nigerian player would you want to have at Arsenal?\n\nAt the moment, Victor Osimhen for sure. We have the money to pay to get him. He\u2019s still very raw though but you can clearly see that he\u2019s getting there.\n\nI think Arsenal can spend this summer. The Kronke\u2019s have backed Mikel Arteta with \u00a3250m or more so I think we have the money. Is \u20ac100m on the high side for Osimhen at the moment, I think it is but if it\u2019s in his contract I think we\u2019ll have to pay it.\n\nHow does it feel watching Arsenal play second fiddle to the likes of Man City, Liverpool and others in the last couple of seasons?\n\nIt\u2019s been very heartbreaking not seeing Arsenal play in the Champions League in the last five seasons. It\u2019s a big club and I think a lot of things have gone wrong in the past but I think there\u2019s stability and Arteta has managed to gel the squad, he knows the kind of players he wants and he\u2019s going after them and inasmuch as I don\u2019t agree with him on some other things, he\u2019s done really well.\n\nWhat would you say Arteta brought to the club?\n\nHe has stabilised the defence. A lot of people criticised Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale when they were signed but he (Arteta) knew what he was doing. My first job in the UK was as a safety steward so I also watched all of Leeds United games so I watched White and Ramsdale play a lot and I can see why he went for them but the money seems to be on the big side.\n\nRamsdale at Sheffield United was their player of the season despite being relegated so it means he wasn\u2019t a bad footballer.\n\nArteta knows who he wants and who to bring in but the only problem I have with him is his man management skills. You look at the Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang, Matteo Guendouzi and William Saliba situation. Could he have done better? Yes.\n\nThe Aubameyang situation really hurt me because I knew him personally and he really loves Arsenal but when family is involved especially your mother, a lot of things happen.\n\nI\u2019m not saying he (Aubameyang) is the best discipline-wise but stripping him of the captaincy was enough. If Arteta can improve on his man management skills and not bring everything to the media, he will be a better manager but I know he is young and is still learning.\n\nGrowing up, were you an active football player?\n\nI think I played a little bit in primary or secondary school but I wasn\u2019t good at it but I loved watching football. My father is a die-hard football fan and I grew up watching and supporting Iwuanyanwu Nationale before I started watching Arsenal.\n\nHow do you feel about Heartland\u2019s current situation, having fallen from grace to grass?\n\nI feel bad when I see the current state of Heartland these days. I get to watch them on the NPFL app. What is happening to Heartland now is really terrible and it looks like each government that comes into power keeps failing them and I am thinking if the government can\u2019t handle them anymore, why not give it to private individuals that love football.\n\nHearing stories about the team getting thrown out of their hotel is really embarrassing and seeing them hovering around the relegation waters is really disheartening but hopefully, we hope they can return to their glory days.\n\nFavourite Arsenal player?\n\nThat would be Thierry Henry but Dennis Bergkamp comes second. I still can\u2019t see people doing what Bergkamp did on the pitch. The artistry and everything but for me, Henry is a very complete player. He dominated the league for a very long time, scored a lot of goals for the team, won us trophies and that makes him a legend in my eyes.\n\nWas there a time you were attacked or abused for supporting Arsenal?\n\nI started doing my interviews on Arsenal Fans TV I saw it as an opportunity to start celebrating my culture. I was always going to matches wearing Nigerian traditional attires and this was deliberate.\n\nIn protecting some Nigerian players, especially Iwobi; I got abused severally even racially. Sometimes when people insult Iwobi, my name is always there in the second line. It happened a lot of times.\n\nWhat are your favourite and worst Arsenal moments?\n\nI\u2019ll say breaking the nine-year trophy drought was my favourite. I was at the stadium that day and the feeling was just electric. We came from two goals down and that stands out.\n\nThe worst, I\u2019ll say the regular bashing from Liverpool.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Governor Akeredolu said rumours of imposition of candidates were sponsored by those he termed \u2018disgruntled purported members whose mission is to destabilize the party ahead of the coming elections.\u2019\n\nAkeredolu who urged aspirants to focus on their campaigns said he is committed to the principle of party supremacy. He said the same principle of party supremacy produced the peaceful and rancour-free congress that was held in the state. Speaking in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Richard Olatunde, Govemor Akeredolu said the allegation that candidates were being propped to be imposed ahead of the party primaries was an attempt by those with tainted party loyalty to box the APC into a state of helplessness in order to whittle down the supremacy of the party.\n\nHis words, \u201cBlackmail cannot stop the resolve of the party to enforce individual and collective discipline through democratic processes as enunciated in the various stakeholders\u2019 sessions in the last three weeks. As an incurable democrat, Governor Akeredolu has always preached and supported fairness, equity and justice even in playing his leadership role in the affairs of the party in the state and at the national level. Governor Akeredolu is a loud voice in the struggle for fairness and the need for the party to walk the path of equity in the forthcoming elections.\n\nHe will not lead any struggle that will defeat his beliefs and strong convictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that Ondo APC is the only rancor-free chapter of the party in the Southwest. This was made possible by the fair and principled leadership of Governor Akeredolu. His commitment to a united party devoid of groupings and factions is unparalleled.\u201d",

About four policemen were seen taking the lawmaker, who looked weak on a stretcher, to the state High Court sitting in Port Harcourt. Despite the order from the Federal High Court that Dagogo should be released on bail, it was gathered that the Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, decided to rather produce him at the state High Court.\n\nThe court remanded the lawmaker representing Degema Bonny Federal Constituency in Port Harcourt correctional center. Trial judge, Justice Chiwendu Nworgu, said he should be remanded following his inability to take his plea and adjourned the matter to May 16. Journalists were barred from covering the proceedings in the court. The prosecuting lawyer, Chidi Eke, said Dagogo lay down all through the proceeding and was unable to speak.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut unfortunately, as they have been saying, that he (Dagogo) is sick so they brought him on stretchers. He did not answer and did not take plea because he was lying down all through the proceedings. At the end of the day what we did was to simply apply to the court that let him be remanded in the custody of the correctional center and then adjourned while he will be having access to medical treatment until he is fit enough to stand the trial.\u201d\n\nEarlier lawyer to Dagogo Innocent Ekwu, faulted the police for not granting the orders of the Federal High Court to release Dagogo, describing them as enemies of democracy. He said: \u201cThis is tyranny, this Is an abuse of the law, this is arrogating to themselves authority that does not lie within them. We are calling on all relevant authorities in this country, especially the Inspector-General of Police to prevail on the Commissioner of Police in the state to release him immediately.\n\nThe Media Assistant to Dagogo, Ibrahim Lawal, lamented that the Eboka forced the lawmaker to court despite his deteriorating health condition. He confirmed that officials of the state government and the police did not allow journalists to cover the proceedings. He said: \u201cThe High Court, where Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo was arraigned, had adjourned to May 16, 2022 only for the CP Friday Eboka to break all known laws in the country by bringing the matter forward before Justice Chiwendu Nwogu, today, May 13th.\n\n\u201cHon. Doctor Farah Dagogo lawyers were not served neither were they aware of the change of date nor reason for change of date and as such were not available to defend him. This renewed judiciary onslaught by the Police Commissioner, Friday Eboka, was pre-determined to disobey and make mockery of the Federal High Court order of May 12, 2022 that granted Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo bail but which was ignored and disobeyed by Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka.\u201d",

          "text": "By Tunde Thomas\n\nAny attempt by either the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to jettison rotation of their presidential tickets to the South in 2023 would endanger Nigeria\u2019s unity and the current democratic system. This was the opinion of the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) and the Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere. Reacting to dumping of zoning by the two major parties, General Secretary, Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide said it was a dangerous development capable of jeopardizing the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is not a fair thing to do now. Dumping zoning will put Nigeria\u2019s democracy in danger. Nigerians have yet to develop confidence in the democratic ideals, so our leadership, and the two political parties must realize our ethnic diversity ,that we are different people who have come to live together, and because of that we must adopt zoning to build the confidence of people in the Nigerian structure. It is too early in the day to jettison zoning because doing so will endanger our democracy. We must give every part of the country a sense of belonging, and both PDP, and APC must recognize this fact. PDP and APC must accept the reality of the Nigerian situation. No part of the country should have a feeling of being excluded or being marginalized.\u201d\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSpeaking further on why it is not ideal for the two major political parties to dump zoning now, Olajide said: \u201cZoning promotes inclusiveness, and the moment that it is dumped some sections or part of the country will feel alienated. Some people may even harbour the feelings that a particular part want to dominate the others, and this is not good for our democracy. Nigerians\u2019 confidence in democracy will be seriously eroded if we dump zoning. Dumping zoning will lead to marginalisation of some set of people, and this is not in the nation\u2019s best interests. We need to inspire the confidence of all Nigerians from different parts of the country in the nation\u2019s democracy, and dumping of zoning will negate that. On its part, Afenifere described the move by both PDP and APC as a ploy to ensure that the North retain power in 2023.\n\nAccording to the group\u2019s spokeman, Comrade Jare Ajayi, both parties dumped zoning as a way of ensuring that the person who takes over power from President Buhari in 2023 is another Northerner. He however warned that such a move is dangerous for the unity of the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHe said: \u201cDumping zoning is not good for the country as it is capable of alienating other sections of the country and deepen the mistrust that became more apparent under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAjayi further added that what was about to be made practical now by the two political parties has been in the offing for some time. He cited, as an example, a view that was reportedly openly expressed by the spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed as far back as September 20, 2021 in which he not only bragged that a Northerner will succeed Buhari as President, but went further to ask anyone that does not want a Northerner as President to leave the country in 2023.\n\nBlaming Southern politicians for continuing to play into the hands of those who do not want the best for Nigeria, Ajayi said: \u201cWhile we may be telling the North to stop the seeming emperor mentality that some of them have, Southern politicians also need to grow up and demonstrate that the interest of their people, much more than personal interests, matter to them.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen further told that international community as well as Nigerians are interested in his position as regards the presidential directive, the CBN Governor stressed that he was not bothered that some people were going to have heart attack, but that he was having fun while those concerned were free to have heart attack.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a new twist yesterday as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and two others joined in the suit filed by Emefiele, seeking court\u2019s determination of his right to participate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThis is just as the federal government has issued a circular directing serving ministers in the cabinet, heads of government agencies, ambassadors and other political appointees of the administration, coveting political ambitions in 2023 to resign from the government.\n\n\n\nAlso, yesterday, the Pan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, lauded the presidential directive that all political appointees interested in the 2023 general elections should resign their appointments forthwith.\n\nOn the suit filed by Emefiele, the court had on Monday adjourned to Thursday to enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) appear before it to explain why the court should not restrain them from preventing the CBN Governor from realising his political ambition by participating in all the processes leading to the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe summoning of INEC and AGF was sequel to a motion exparte argued by Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, to restrain the two defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise the interest of his client.\n\n\n\nRuling in the ex parte, Justice Mohammed had ordered the CBN Governor to serve all court processes in relation to the suit he filed against INEC and the AGF who were the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.\n\nHowever, when the matter was called yesterday. both INEC and AGF were in court in line with the court\u2019s order.\n\nHowever, instead of proceeding with the case of the CBN Governor, two lawyers stood up to announce appearances for their clients.\n\n\n\nFirst was a Senior advocate of Nigeria, Chief Sebastiane Hon, who informed the court of the intention of his client, the PDP to join as an interested party, which was immediately followed by one John Martins and Olukunle Ebun, who told the court that they were suing for themselves and on behalf of the Save Nigeria our Fatherland.\n\nResponding, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, who did not oppose the applicants joining the suit, undertook to serve the applicants with all processes within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nWhile INEC through its lawyer, Mr. Ibrahim Inuwa, SAN, did not also oppose the application for joinder, that of the AGF, Mr. Dipo Okpeseyi, SAN, did and urged the court to ensure that only proper parties should be allowed to join in the matter.\n\nIn a short ruling, the court joined the PDP, John Martins and Olukunle Ebun as 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants respectively.\n\n\n\nJustice Mohammed in addition ordered accelerated hearing on the matter, adding that while the 1st and 2nd defendants were directed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s suit within Monday and Tuesday, the 3rd to 5th defendants have up till Wednesday next week to respond and the plaintiff, 24 hours to reply on point of law.\n\nJustice Mohammed subsequently adjourned to May 23, for parties to adopt their final written addresses.\n\nJustice Mohammed while warning that the court would not entertain any request for extension of time since all parties have pledged to the accelerated hearing of the matter, also warned parties not to take any step that would undermine the proceedings.\n\n\n\nEmefiele had amongst others approached the Federal High Court for an Order restraining the defendants from preventing or hindering his participating in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nHe expressed the fear that any political party he chooses to affiliate with in realising his political ambition may disqualify him based on the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which had barred political appointees from participating in the congresses and conventions of political parties unless the resigned 30 days to such conventions and congresses.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\n\n\nAmongst the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise his desire to contest the presidential election.\n\nArguing the motion for maintenance of status quo, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Ozekhome had told the court that Emefiele, \u201cis in a delimma\u201d as to whether he can run in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ozekhome, time is of utmost importance, following the fact that timeline for collection of nomination and expression of interest forms ends on Wednesday May 11.\n\nOzekhome in addition told the court that timeline for the primaries and congresses of political parties have been fixed for May 30 to June 1, and unless the court intervened there will be a carriage of great injustice against his client.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe needs the protection of the court, the court needs to ensure that nobody does anything that will hurt him\u201d, the senior lawyer submitted, adding that if the court refused to grant the order for maintenance of status quo restraining the defendants from hindering Emefiele from participating in the primary election under a political party of his choice within this period, the case would amount to a mere academic exercise by the time parties return to the court.\n\nFG Asks Ministers, Heads of Agencies, Ambassadors, Other Appointees Nursing Political Ambitions in 2023 to Resign\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government\u2019s circular, dated May 11, 2022, with Ref. No.SGF/OP/l/S.3/Xll/173, a copy which was sighted by THISDAY, was issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha.\n\nThe circular was addressed to all serving ministers, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, National Security Adviser, Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service and heads of extra-ministerial departments, Directors-General/Chief Executive Officers of parastatals, agencies and government-owned companies among others.\n\n\n\nIn the circular, Mustapha stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had observed and noted the expression of interest and intention by some members of the Federal Executive Council, Heads of Extra-Ministerial departments, agencies, parastatals of government, ambassadors and other political office holders to contest the upcoming presidential, gubernatorial, National and State Assemblies\u2019 elections.\n\n\n\nHe said the president had directed that the affected office holders aspiring to run for various offices in the 2023 General Elections, should tender their resignation on or before Monday, May 16, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe SGF said for smooth running of the machinery of government and the country\u2019s foreign missions, the affected ministers are to hand over to the Ministers of State where they exist or to the Permanent Secretary, where there is no Minister of State.\n\nAlso all ambassadors are to hand over to their Deputy Heads of Mission or the most Senior Foreign Service Officer in line with established practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Heads of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals are to hand over to the most senior Director/Officer as may be peculiar to the organisation, in line with the service wide Circular No. SGF.50/S. Il/C.2/268 of 4th December, 2017,\u201d the circular added. The SGF said the circular and the incidental directives take effect immediately.\n\nAfenifere Hails Buhari\u2019s Directive for Ministers, Others to Resign\n\nHowever, Afenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the directive given by Buhari on political appointees and the promptness of its execution demonstrated that he could be decisive where and when he wants to and on matters that touch his heart.\n\n\n\nWhile conceding that the resignation of those interested in contesting would provide a level playing ground for all contestants, Afenifere spokesman called on the president to apply the same decisiveness with which he charged his appointees to resign also in tackling the myriads of challenges facing the country to avert a slide into anarchy.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe gusto with which the order of President Muhammadu Buhari on political appointees to resign if they intend to contest in the forthcoming elections was carried out indicated that he seems to be comfortable with those other aspects of governance that Nigerians are complaining about because of the pains they are suffering.\n\n\n\n\u201cWere he to be disturbed by and concerned about those things that are bothering Nigerians he would have brought the same swiftness to bear on those areas. It makes it difficult for one to agree with the notion that he does not have the power or capacity to deal with at least some of the major problems Nigerians are battling with.\n\n\u201cHe has failed to deal with them only because he did not consider them as problematic as the rest of us are considering them.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that unfortunately, those who are close to the president and could make him see the challenges realistically failed to do so either because they were afraid or profiting from the anomalies going on or both.\n\n\u201cFor example, what stops the President from providing all that is needed by the security agencies in the country to put a stop to terrorism and insecurity going on in the country? What stops him from ensuring that the Ministries of Education and Labour provide the wherewithal for the smooth running of our universities in line with the proposition that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) have been making for several years? What stops President Buhari from breathing life back into the moribund four refineries in the country or build new ones?\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere spokesman argued that the issue of non-availability of fund should no longer be an excuse, saying after all, his party raised several billions of naira in less than two weeks just to express interests in running for offices.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the ruling party could raise such a huge sum within so short a time, why is government finding it difficult to raise the N200 billion required to make our educational institutions at tertiary level worthy of its name? Between contest for elective offices and education of the country, which should be more important?\u201d, Ajayi asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*As THISDAY checks uncover discrepancies in actual amount, parties reluctant to offer explanation\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications Plc\u2019s claim that it paid the sum of N618.7 billion in both direct and indirect taxes to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in 2021 has continued to raise dusts in public quarters, THISDAY can report.\n\n\n\nOn April 2, 2022, MTN Nigeria, in a statement issued by the company\u2019s secretary, Uto Ukpanah, had said it paid the amount in direct and indirect taxes to the FIRS in the 2021 tax year, making it the largest single biggest contributor to taxes in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThe company added that its total tax contribution to all government agencies was 13.5 per cent of FIRS\u2019 total collection for the year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2021, MTN Nigeria\u2019s total tax contribution to all government agencies including the FIRS amounted to N757.6 billion while FIRS collected a total of N6.4 trillion tax revenue in the year,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHowever, the MTN\u2019s claim came on the heels of FIRS\u2019 recognition of 20 top taxpayers in the country including the telecommunications giant.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, THISDAY calculations revealed that the N618.7 billion tax payment as claimed by MTN Nigeria represented less than 10 per cent of the N6.4 trillion that was reported as total collection by the service for 2021.\n\nHence, MTN\u2019s claim that it contributed 13 per cent of total FIRS collections of N6.4 trillion would mean it actually remitted N832 billion to the federal government in the period in question.\n\n\n\nFollowing the apparent discrepancy unraveled by the THISDAY checks, using MTN\u2019s prior statement, the former raised pertinent questions and sought clarification from both the apex revenue agency and the telecommunications company.\n\n\n\nRegrettably, the FIRS has declined to provide THISDAY with the specific amount paid by the company as taxes but said the figure churned out by MTN does not tally with its own account.\n\nYet, the buck falls on FIRS as a matter of transparency and confidence in the management of public accounts to make proper rendition to Nigerians.\n\nThe development particularly smacks of negligence on the part of the service and requires that both parties unravel the truth.\n\n\n\nSources have confided in THISDAY that the refusal of both FIRS and MTN to do the needful contradicts the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) which among other things, forbids companies and agencies of the government from withholding critical information that is in public interest.\n\nObservers also said the attitude of both companies serves to undermine the anti-corruption agenda of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Section 2, sub-section 4 of the FOI Act requires that \u201ca public institution shall ensure that information referred to in this section is widely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means, including print, electronic, and online sources, and at offices of such public institutions.\n\n\n\nAnalysts also said MTN Nigeria, as a corporate entity cannot afford to shy away from the principles of transparency and accountability in the interest of its shareholders and the public in general by detailing the various taxes it paid to government within the year in question.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*As party places fate of contenders in hands of screening committee\n\n*Political appointees drag APC, INEC to court over disqualification threats\n\nAlex Enumah and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThere are indications that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may be walking on political landmines ahead of the 2023 elections following the refusal of some of its serving ministers who are presidential hopefuls to resign their positions 30 days to the party\u2019s primary as directed by the guidelines released by the party before the commencement of the process.\n\n\n\nThis is just as some political appointees who intend to participate in the forthcoming general elections under the platform of the APC have instituted a legal action against the party over disqualification threat occasioned by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe leadership of the party had in the guidelines sold alongside the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms mandated the political appointees to resign 30 days before the presidential primary of the party slated for May 30.\n\nClearly, Article 3(i) of the APC final guidelines for the conduct of primaries, states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates. Any political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe decision of the party to avoid legal landmines may not be unconnected with Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act which mandates political appointees to resign before the election.\n\nWhile the Electoral Act was not specific on whether the appointees should resign after the primary election or the general election, the guidelines of the ruling party was not ambiguous.\n\n\n\nRather than comply, the ministers sat tight following the ruling of a Federal High Court in Umuahia which struck down Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Wednesday, citing \u2018lack of locus standi,\u2019 voided the judgment of the Federal High Court in Umuahia.\n\n\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the three-member panel of the appellate court presided over by Justice Hamma Barka held that the said Section 84 (12) was unconstitutional because it breaches Section 42 (1)(a) of the Constitution by denying a class of Nigerian citizens their right to participate in election.\n\nThe implication of the judgment pending the determination by the Supreme court meant that Section 84(12) subsists.\n\n\n\nIt was based on this judgement that President Muhammadu Buhari gave the marching order to the ministers and asked them to resign.\n\nThe president while demanding the resignation of the ministers, had announced that the Minister of State for Education, Hon. Emeka Nwajuiba had resigned his appointment on April 28, as directed by the party. The resignation letter was forwarded to the president.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite his purported resignation, Nwajiuba failed to channel his letter to the appropriate authority \u2013 the Secretary of the Government of the Federation (SGF) for documentation and public record.\n\nBesides, after the minister submitted the letter, he was still attending meetings.\n\nAnalysts believed that aggrieved members or opposition parties could still explore his refusal to resign properly in the court of law.\n\n\n\nThe analysts were of the view that if the party goes against its guidelines, a repetition of the Zamfara and Rivers scenario might be in the offing.\n\nPresently, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio and Nwajiuba have resigned.\n\n\n\nTheir resignation came two weeks before the party\u2019s primary. The questions on the lips analysts are: Will the APC in flagrant violation of its own guidelines screen all those who failed to heed to its directive as contained in the guidelines? If the party proceeds with their screening, can that not lead to litigation by some party members who would contest their eligibility? Or will the party adhere to the guidelines and disqualify all the ministers and others at the point of screening on the grounds that they flouted the its guidelines ab initio?\n\n\n\nRenowned constitutional lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, was of the opinion that all those who failed to comply with the party\u2019s guidelines which was an extract from the 2022 Electoral Act ought to be disqualified from participation in the process.\n\n\n\nIn his view, resigning now is a waste of time. He went on to say that the operating legal framework was the 2022 Electoral Act until set aside by a superior court which at the moment is not the case.\n\nSo, by allowing the aspirants participate in the process is the APC setting itself up for a replay of the Rivers and Zamfara scenarios?\n\n\n\nHowever, speaking with THISDAY in a telephone interview yesterday, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, said the Electoral Act didn\u2019t provide any timeline for political appointees to resign.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat is the decision of the relevant committees of the party to make. These discussions are not heard by any individual, however highly placed.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I cannot give you an answer. But the only thing I will remind you is that the Electoral Act that provides for these resignations didn\u2019t impose any timeline. It\u2019s important that when you do the stories, to present all information so people can actually get a perspective.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act is a law, an Act of parliament, generally speaking, supersedes other inferior laws and regulations. So usually, any lawyer will tell you that when there\u2019s a conflict between the constitution and Act of Parliament, the act of parliament you know, is subordinate to the constitution.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act didn\u2019t provide any timeline; each person must resign. So these are the issues that the committee will have to grapple with and decide, ahead of the screening, and all of that.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, if the committee, for example, thinks the view that the Electoral Act provisions should apply, then the question you\u2019re asking becomes mute. And that would be a fair decision because, the Electoral Act is obviously superior to any rules or regulations by political institutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not that clear cut. I know, you guys, like yes or no answers, but sometimes yes, or no answers don\u2019t address the issue.\u201d\n\nMorka insisted that bringing Zamfara scenario into focus would be speculative, saying Section 84 does not dictate a timeline.\n\n\n\n\u201cSection 84(12) does not dictate a guideline. It doesn\u2019t say resign a week before or a month before. So if it doesn\u2019t say that, then what the Court of Appeal said is irrelevant to this question you are asking.\u201d\n\nThe party spokesperson noted that the constitution with respect to civil servants says you must resign a month before an election.\n\n\n\nMorka stressed, \u201cSo in other words, if this question is based on the Electoral Act alone, any minister who resigns 24 hours before the primaries is fine. It doesn\u2019t say resign one month, or two weeks or one hour before, it just says resign before. So, at any point before primaries, people are still free to resign.\n\n\u201cBut now the president has given a directive that\u2019s purely presidential and administrative. They are ministers serving at the pleasure of the president.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo he has requested them to resign. So I\u2019m quite sure that they will comply. He\u2019s the Commander in Chief. He has the right to hire them and to demand their resignation. So that is a separate issue altogether.\u201d.\n\n2023: Political Appointees Drag APC, INEC to Court over Disqualification Threats\n\nSome political appointees who intend to participate in the forthcoming general elections under the platform of the APC have instituted a legal action against the party over disqualification threat occasioned by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs amongst whom included a governorship and two House of Representatives aspirants in the suit are seeking for an order of court stopping the APC as well as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from disqualifying them on the strength of their being political appointees and section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nThe aspirants, Ambassador Sodique Abubakar, Lawal Abubakar and Bindir Buba in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/641/2022 are contending that Section 84 (11) and (12) of the new Electoral Act is discriminatory against them and unconstitutional and therefore should not be permitted by the court to be used to disqualify them on account of their mere political appointment.\n\n\n\nIn their originating summons filed on May 11, 2022, by Chief Adeniyi Akintola SAN, the plaintiffs want the court to determine whether being Nigerians covered by sections 66, 177, 182 of the 1999 Constitution could be subjected to any other conditions, rules or guidelines for the purpose of election into the office of the Governor of Bauchi State and House of Representatives respectively by the APC under Section 221 of the Constitution other than the qualifications and criteria set out in sections 66, 177 and 182 of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThey also ask the court to determine whether being card- carrying members of APC and political appointees they could be prevented or barred from participating in its political convention, congress or primaries merely because they are political appointees.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs further sought determination of whether the directive of APC based on section 184 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022, that political appointees must resign their positions 30 days before they can participate in its convention, congress or primaries for the purpose of standing as political party candidates in the coming election is Constitutional.\n\n\n\nBesides, they also asked the court to determine whether section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 was not in conflict with section 84 (3) of the same Electoral Act and whether or not by virtue of Section 1 (1) and (3) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria is not Supreme and Superior to all other legislations and statutes including the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nUpon resolution of the issues in their favour, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees should resign from their respective posts as a result of section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022, was unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\n\n\nThey sought an order declaring as unconstitutional, illegal and unlawful the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees must resign from their positions before they could participate as voting delegates or be voted for in the convention or Primaries of the party.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs also applied for an order of injunction restraining APC and INEC either by themselves or agents from preventing, hindering or stopping them from attending, participating in party congress, convention or primaries for the purpose of voting or being voted for as candidates in the forthcoming elections and in any congress, convention or primaries.\n\n\n\nIn their 26-paragraph affidavit in support of the suit, the 1st plaintiff, Ambassador Abubakar claimed to be a political appointee and currently serving as Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Republic of Chad.\n\nThe 2nd Plaintiff, Abubakar claimed to be a Special Assistant in the Federal Capital Territory Administration FCTA while the 3rd defendant, Buba claimed he is a National Coordinator, Social Investment Program in the Ministry of Humanitarian.\n\n\n\nThey averred that they have obtained expression of interest forms to contest in the primaries of the APC for nomination as candidates in the coming election.\n\n\n\nThey further hinted that pursuant to signing of the Electoral Act into law, there has been threats that political appointees will be disqualified from contesting primaries of APC because of section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe affidavit deposed to by one Oluwafemi Abimbola, a legal practitioner on behalf of the plaintiffs averred that sections 65, 66, 107, 131, 137,;177 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution covered qualification requirements of aspirants to political posts in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThey claimed that Article 2 of APC Constitution affirmed Supremacy of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution but the same party breached the section with its directive of May 7th that all political appointees must resign 30 days before its primary election.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs stated that Section 84 (11) and (12) are at the moment standing on their way to achieve their political ambitions and that unless the APC and INEC are restrained from the thread, they will be prevented from participating in the primary for nomination as candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, no date has yet been fixed for hearing of the suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Nigerian education consultant identified as Yinka Ogunde has alleged that some parents now actively blackmail schools and their staff members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe consultant shared a number of cases in the wake of the arrest of a staffer of Methodist Girls High School, Yaba identified as Bakare Adewale over assault allegations.\n\nAdewale, 48, was alleged to have sexually molested a 9-year-old female student in the school.\n\nIt was gathered that the father of the girl, identified as Adebisi Arewa, went to a police station at Illupeju to report the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough he did not give details of how the incident occurred, it was also reported that the police arrested and later transferred the accused to the gender section of the command for interrogation.\n\nIn her Facebook post on Thursday, Ogunde lamented that some parents now actively blackmail schools.\n\nShe claimed the accuser had a proclivity for making accusations against school staff without providing evidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was painful listening to various stories about how some parents manipulate and sometimes blackmail schools. Adewale Bakare is a teacher and works with Methodist Girls High School,\u201d the consultant wrote.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a parent well noted for accusing workers in the school environment of sexually abusing his daughter(s) got him arrested on a totally unfounded allegation.\n\n\u201cI asked why Bakare. He apparently had a disagreement with the said father sometime in December about parking space.\n\n\u201cThe father of the young girl, a law lecturer (some said professor), got him arrested and remanded in Kirikiri claiming he abused his daughter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe father of the girl about four years ago accused a school bus driver of the same offense (his daughter does not go with the school bus).\n\n\u201cAccording to the lawyer of the young school bus driver, there was not a single piece of evidence that showed any contact between the driver and the young girl. Unfortunately, he was sent to life imprisonment this February.\u201d\n\nOgunde said the pregnant wife of the embattled teacher went into premature labour due to trauma from the case.\n\n\u201cThe same father also accused a cleaner and a female teacher. Fortunately, they got off but the female teacher lost her pregnancy during the stressful period,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow Bakare is in Kirikiri. His own family is traumatized his wife went into early labour and his baby is still in an incubator. Of course, he has been badly beaten in prison. I can really tell you a lot but let me stop here.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow the judicial system to jail an innocent man. The lawyer father has destroyed too many lives. He lives alone with two young daughters.\n\n\u201cHe parks his car right inside the school to watch everything especially since the ASUU strike began and he did not need to go to work). Let us pray that the magistrate will do the right thing and release the teacher.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google unveils first smartwatch, new phones, virtual cards and more",
          "text": "Google on Wednesday and Thursday held its annual developer conference where it revealed an expanded line of new products and services.\n\nAt its first in-person developer conference in 3 years, the tech giant announced 3 new smartphones and its first in-house smartwatch as well as plans to release a new tablet next year. Google also announced updates to several of its most popular tools including Maps, Google Translate and its core search product.\n\nHere are some major announcements made:\n\nNew Pixel Watch and Pixel phones\n\nIn 2019, Fitbit was acquired by Google for $2.1 billion, a move many saw as a hint that Google was planning to go head-on with the likes of Apple and Samsung, which are already market leaders in smartwatches.\n\nTwo years later, Google has finally launched its first in-house built watch. The Pixel watch can be paired with Android devices only and is 4G-compatible, which means it can function on its own without being near a phone\u2014but to do this it requires its own data plan.\n\nThe tech giant did not reveal a price for the wearable, but it said it would be a \u201cpremium product\u201d when it launches in the 4th quarter of the year.\n\nThere are already many third-party Android watches which run on Google\u2019s Wear operating system but so far Google has not had its own device until now.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, Google announced its new mid-tier phone, the Pixel 6A. It also unveiled its next flagship phones: the Pixel 7 Pro with a triple rear camera system and the Pixel 7 with two rear cameras.\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Google announced that it\u2019s getting back to releasing tablets after announcing that it will be focusing solely on building in 2019. The new Android tablet is set to be released in 2023.\n\nUpdated Search and Maps\n\nSource: Google\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Google processes approximately 63,000 search queries every second, 5.6 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. Google search which started from only text queries has over the years added the option to use voice and picture queries options.\n\nNow Google\u2019s new multi-search feature\u2014Multi-search Near Me\u2014allows users to search using text and images at the same time. The tech giant pointed out that the use cases for this feature include searching for a meal or outfit, and finding local results from restaurants, retailers and more.\n\nSource: Google\n\nFor a long time, Google Map has been the most popular Map app in the world, helping people around the world including Africans navigate through cities and rural areas. Now it\u2019s getting a new feature that allows users to view their cities in a more immersive way.\n\nThe new feature, immersive view, fuses together Street View and aerial imagery in order to offer a digital model of the world and a new way to explore cities, key landmarks, restaurants, venues, and other places of interest.\n\nGoogle maps\u2019 new immersive view for cities comes off as a challenger to Apple\u2019s 3D mode map view. In addition to this, Maps also now offers to find the most fuel-efficient route to get there with eco-friendly routing and offer users the ability to access Google Maps Live View in other third-party apps with the ARCore Geospatial API.\n\nVirtual cards\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle is rolling out virtual credit cards to help protect users\u2019 financial information while they\u2019re shopping online. The feature generates a virtual card number that users can autofill instead of their actual card information on Android mobile devices or in Google\u2019s Chrome browser, masking their real credit card number from the companies they\u2019re shopping from. These virtual cards are typically used for one-time purchases, but users will also be able to use these cards for subscriptions.\n\nVirtual cards will roll out this summer initially only for US users with Visa, Mastercard American Express and Capital One credit cards.\n\nTranslation and AR glasses\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle Translate has added support for 24 additional languages, bringing the total number of languages the product supports to 133.\n\nOver 300 million people across Africa, Asia and South America speak these newly-added languages. 10 of the 24 new languages added to Google Translate are spoken in Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Mali, South Africa, Eritrea, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nClosely related to this announcement was Google unveiling Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that hint it plans to join companies like Snap and Meta who have AR glasses ambitions. Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation. The tech giant revealed no details on whether this will be a product people can buy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s first attempt at creating smart glasses was roughly a decade ago, but it didn\u2019t take off as expected due to its limited launch, high initial pricing and privacy concerns.\n\nAds and user privacy\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle made a set of security and privacy announcements which will roll out later in the year.\n\nA notable one is the My Ad Centre hub, a new control centre that will give users more control and visibility over how their ads are personalised across Google\u2019s apps and sites, including Google Search, YouTube, and the Discover feed in Google app.\n\nIt\u2019ll let users customise the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic. For example, if you want to see fewer ads about fashion, you can indicate.\n\nThe hub will also make it easier for users to request that their personal information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses be scrubbed from search results.\n\nThese announcements come after Google reported its 2022 Q1 revenue which was up 23% from the same period last year, reaching $68 billion, while its net profit dropped to $16.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s $17.9 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira Speed Wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DStv or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed Wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools. The MARA Chain will launch later in 2022, giving savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.

          "text": "Twenty-one companies in Nigeria that are making their entrepreneurial endeavours count against all odds have been listed in a ranking by the Financial Times (FT) among the fastest-growing companies in Africa. BusinessDay was a cooperation partner in the research.\n\nCovering the period between 2017 and 2020, while taking the COVID-19 pandemic into consideration and highlighting the companies that successfully adapted to the resultant challenges, the FT\u2019s ranking showed Nigeria has the second-highest number of successful companies after South Africa with 24 companies. Kenya came third with nine companies.\n\nAccording to the FT, the countries with the highest representations are also the markets that have attracted the most venture capital and where unicorns (companies valued at $1 billion+) and would-be unicorns have proliferated.\n\nThe successful companies were ranked based on their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue between 2017 and 2020, as demanded by the FT and research company Statista.\n\nThe criteria included that the revenue generated by the firm must be at least $100,000 in 2017, revenue of at least $1.5 million in 2020 which must be organic, the company must be headquartered in one of the African countries, and it is not a subsidiary or branch office of any kind.\n\nThe successful Nigerian companies are AFEX Commodities Exchange, Zedcrest Group, Starsight Energy, Kawai Technologies, West African Soy Industries Limited, Commercio Partners, Northern Nigerian Flour Mills (NNFM), Alpha Morgan Capital Managers, WACOT Rice, Field Intelligence, and Tripple Gee & Company.\n\nOthers are FoodCo Nigeria, Global Accelerex, Prestige Assurance, Julius Berger Nigeria, Genesis Food Nigeria, Courteville Business Solutions, RT Briscoe Nigeria, Mutual Benefits Assurance, United Capital and HIS Netherlands Holdco BV.\n\nSix of the successful Nigerian companies are listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\n\u201cIt is a significant accomplishment and recognises the work we have been doing over the past eight years. Although the global pandemic has proved challenging over the past two years, we\u2019ve worked extremely hard to improve Africa\u2019s commodity market,\u201d Ayodeji Balogun, CEO at AFEX Commodities, said.\n\nFurther findings showed AFEX Commodities topped the Nigerian list, posting 4,289.7 percent average growth between 2017 and 2020, and ranked third in Africa. Zedcrest Group, a firm whose growth has been spurred by innovation in the nation\u2019s financial services, was ranked second in Nigeria and fifth in Africa with 1,481.7 percent growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be ranked on the inaugural FT Africa\u2019s Fastest-Growing Companies list,\u201d said Adedayo Amzat, Group Managing Director at Zedcrest Group. \u201cIt is a direct reflection of the leadership team we have in place, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our team. We\u2019ve been fortunate to extend our business across different verticals of the financial sector over the past few years and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities in other markets as part of our future growth strategy.\u201d\n\nHe reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to building inter-connected financial solutions across Africa through technological innovation while ensuring global best practices.\n\nStarsight Energy posted 1,154.4 percent growth to be ranked sixth in Africa. It was followed by Kawai Technologies, which recorded 535.6 percent growth during the period. West African Soy Industries, a firm in the nation\u2019s agricultural sector, recorded 507.6 percent growth.\n\nCommercio Partners, NNFM, Alpha Morgan, WACOT Rice, Field Intelligence, Tripple Gee and Co. all recorded revenue growth of between 170.1 percent and 232.3 percent. HIS Netherlands Holdco BV, FoodCo Nigeria, Global Accelerex, and Prestige Assurance posted growth of between 80 percent and 160 percent.\n\nNigeria\u2019s construction giant, Julius Berger, grew its revenue during the period by 70.3 percent. Genesis Food, 54 percent; Courtville, 50.8 percent; Briscoe, 48 percent; Mutual Benefits, 45.4 percent, and United Capital, 44.3 percent.\n\nSome companies are missing from the list, the British paper says, for reasons that include private companies refusing to disclose their revenue figures. The survey required a chief executive or similar senior figure to certify revenue numbers.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s biggest downstream firms grow profit by 57% despite dirty petrol saga\n\nAnnouncing the list of the successful African companies, FT said: \u201cFrom digitising informal trade to fintech and mining, the inaugural list reflects trends on the continent.\u201d\n\nIt said following the application phase, Statista examined the officially stated revenue data of about 900 companies in Africa, adding that high-profile companies that met the criteria for inclusion were added to the list.\n\nIt said the data were collected through research using official sources, such as publicly available earning presentations, investor relations websites, or annual reports.\n\nAccording to the FT, the inaugural annual ranking of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing companies provides a snapshot of the corporate landscape in a continent where technology and support-service businesses have had to adapt to a radically altered environment.\n\nIt said chief among the recent challenges had been operating within the tough restrictions introduced by many African governments to combat COVID-19.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn the end, outside of South Africa and parts of north Africa, the health impact has been less severe than many feared. But the economic consequences of lockdown-especially in crowded urban settings where many lived hand to mouth-have been devastating.\n\n\u201cMany of the fastest-growing companies, especially in the fintech sector, are those seeking to tap Africa\u2019s unbanked population, or markets that have previously been underserved or ignored. The health and education sectors, for example, spurred by unmet need and rising aspirations, are among those offering most scope for growth.\u201d",

          "text": "Continuous Voters Registration to end soon- INEC \u2026as CSOs charge INEC to do more to improve on the conduct of Ekiti election\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said the on-going continous voters registration exercise nationwide will be ending soon. He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system.

          "title": "Uko to Edwin Clark: It\u2019s contradictory to support Southeast presidency and endorse Sylva",
          "text": "Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), has appealed to Edwin Clark, elder statesman and former minister of information to withdraw his endorsement of Timipre Sylva and throw his weight behind Southeast presidency in 2023.\n\nUko who made the appeal to the elder statesman in a statement on Friday, expressed reservations with his decision to endorse Sylva, minister of state for petroleum who is from Bayelsa State, south-south, despite his known support for Southeast presidency.\n\n\u201cHighly revered Chief Edwin Clark\u2019s support for power shift to the South East is highly commendable, but his equal support to South South aspirants such as Timipre Sylva, makes his support for power shift to the South East, look suspect,\u201d Uko who is also the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), said.\n\n\u201cChief Edwin Clark endorsed Timipre Sylva and gave him his full backing, while giving us the impression that he believes power should shift to the South East. Quite confusing.\n\n\u201cWhich brings me to the altercation between Chief Edwin Clark and Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\n\u201cSenator Kalu had complained bitterly over the greed and insensitivity of our southern brethren from the South West and South South, who discreetly count on using the age long anti Igbo emotions in the country, to scuttle South East presidency in 2023, by grabbing the presidency for themselves, thereby keeping the South East effectively away from the plum office for at least another sixteen years, as power will revert back to the North for their eight years, after SW or SS must have done their eight years.\n\n\u201cKeeping South East out for sixteen years after Obasanjo\u2019s eight years as President and Osinbajo\u2019s eight as VP, simply means that all South East politicians will be too old to contest the Presidency in 2039 when power will rotate back to the South again.\n\n\u201cSenator Kalu had argued that the two big parties should have zoned the presidency to the South East as the country did in 1998 for the South West.\n\n\u201cHe frowned at the pretense and hypocrisy that a South East candidate stands a chance against a South West or South South candidate in the heated ethnic politics of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe lamented over the lack of consideration and inequity displayed by our Southern brethren who are scheming to further isolate the South East by denying the South East the opportunity to lead Nigeria for a season come 2023.\n\n\u201cNow, the game is that our Southern brethren are cleverly pretending that they do not know that the configuration of the anti Igbo coalition that prosecuted the civil war (1967-1970), will always mobilise votes for the other non Igbo candidate running against the South East candidate in the spirit of the ever-alive anti Igbo emotions ruling the country, mostly as a result of the huge envy the Igbo man\u2019s success in trade and commerce usually elicits.\n\n\u201cMoreover, religious leaders and other opinion leaders would readily and easily mobilise their people against the South East candidate in preference for the other Southern choice.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the only truthful way to heal the land, would be to replay the 1998 scenario where the two big parties zoned the presidency to the South West, but this time, doing same to the South East.\n\n\u201cAny body pretending they are unaware of anti Igbo sentiments in the land, that would jeopardise South East candidate\u2019s chances to the benefit of a South West or South South counter choice, is insincere and mischievous.\n\n\u201cNo South East candidate will stand a chance against a South West or South South candidate given the anti Igbo sentiments in the land.\n\n\u201cAccordingly I plead with Chief Edwin Clark to kindly plead with aspirants from the South West and South South to kindly withdraw from the race, in order to allow the South East produce candidates for both parties, as that remains the only way to heal the land. In the spirit of Obasanjo and Falae from the South West in 1999.\n\n\u201cAnything short of this is hypocritical, deceptive and mischievous. Trusting in Chief Clark\u2019s influence and ability to mobilise other elders from other regions to buy into our plea, we hope that our plea will be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cThree weeks to the primaries may seem late in the day, but in politics 24 hours is enough to change the dynamics of the game.\n\n\u201cYes, we agree that all these would have been done at least two years ago. We also agree that lobbying would have been concluded at least two years ago, but scamming the good people of the South East with pretentious and fake support, is unkind and ungodly. The country should do for the South East what we all did for the South West 24 years ago.\n\n\u201cIn that connection, we stand 100% with Senator Orji Uzor Kalu that the two big parties should kindly zone the presidential slot for the 2023 elections to the South East for equity, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cWe plead with Chief Edwin Clark to withdraw his support and endorsement for Chief Timipre Sylva and help mobilise elders and statesmen from other regions to prevail upon politicians and leaders of the two big political parties to kindly zone the presidential ticket of both parties to the South East this time around.\n\n\u201cAnything else is mere grand standing, deception and sheer mischief.\u201d",

He said that many graduates are not employable because they are not equipped with the right skill.\n\n\u201cBut more than just what seems to be an oversupply of labour, there is also the problem of the quality of human capital being produced.

Sharing music is one of the best ways to find common ground with people on an exchange program. The appeal of music is truly universal,\u201d Ambassador Leonard added.\n\nIn his welcoming remarks, Acting U.S. Consul General Brandon Hudspeth noted that cultural and artistic exchanges are just one way the United States partners with the people and government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe continue to explore innovative ways to foster valuable people-to-people connections between our two countries,\u201d Hudspeth said. \u201cThe U.S. Mission is honored to partner with the Headies. This year\u2019s Headies Awards will highlight the Nigerian music industry\u2019s creativity and growing global reach.\u201d\n\nExecutive Producer of the Headies Music Awards, Ayo Animashaun, noted that it\u2019s the first year the Headies will be held outside of Nigeria. He described Atlanta as home to many prominent hip-hop and R&B artists and their record labels.\n\n\u201cThe Headies recognizes outstanding achievements in the Nigerian music industry.

          "text": "\u2026 Strike affecting our mental health \u2013 Students \u2026. FG, ASUU playing politics with Nigerian students\u2019 future \u2013 NGOs \u2018\u2026Youths have already lost faith in education\u2019 \u2018\u2026We\u2019re creating a crisis we can\u2019t manage\u2019\n\nParents have expressed sadness over the extension of its industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) for another 12 weeks (three months), describing the development as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\n\nParents, who spoke with our correspondents in separate interviews, said the strike has exposed their children to anti-social behaviours like robbery, kidnapping and Yahoo Yahoo (internet fraud).\n\nASUU had embarked on strike on February 14 to press home its demands which included revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances and the deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for payment of university lecturers.\n\nTheir lamentations\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend, on Thursday, Mrs. Josrphine Ayuba, a civil servant who spoke with this reporter expressed fears that the strike has exposed her children to crime.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have two undergraduates who are at home doing nothing. ASUU strike exposed our children to crimes. ASUU should learn how to use proper dialogue in solving problems rather than strikes which worsen things. ASUU has caused a lot of harm since it embarked on strike in February and many students who were exposed to idleness as a result of the strike were involved in many anti-social behaviours including robbery, kidnapping and banditry.\n\n\u201cA society that has debased education to the dump status cannot complain when its youth scorn academic pursuit and embrace get-rich-quick mentality like we are witnessing today. Our children have taken to Yahoo Yahoo due to idleness occasioned by the unending ASUU strikes. Young undergraduates are increasingly being arrested and imprisoned for cybercrime.\n\n\u201cDialogue is the best solution in resolving the problems rather than embarking on strike and I urge them to have a rethink in the interest of the Nigerian youths who may be exposed to idleness that may lead them into crime.\u201d\n\nAlso, in an emotion-laden voice, Mr. Bassey Aniwam said there is the need for parents to rise up and challenge \u201cthis ASUU-FG brouhaha that has continued to disrupt the academic growth of the Nigerian child.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy son would have graduated, but due to the nine months ASUU strike and the Covid-19 pandemic, and now, he is yet to graduate, and presently at home doing nothing. The financial implication is another burden as I have to make an extra budget. And this is not funny, considering the economic situation in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening between ASUU and the government is very pathetic. It is a case of when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. Our innocent children are at the receiving end of all the disruptions because most of the children of our leaders are outside the country studying without any disruption. For a five-year course, my daughter spent almost seven years in school because of the ASUU strike. All her mates in private universities graduated and were making mockery of her. Parents should rise up in one accord, and challenge this oppressive government to resolve this issue permanently,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, stating her frustrations to Blueprint Weekend, Mrs. Eveline Jatau said she fears that her children would fall into bad company.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is a disturbing situation. You know you cannot keep these young people in one place for too long. They keep finding excuses to go out and there is little you can do as a parent because you know it is caused by boredom. So you just continue to hope and pray that they don\u2019t come to harm\u2019s way\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have two of them who are affected by the strike and the situation is giving me serious problems. Whenever I go to work, I am always afraid of the type of friends they might have taken home or gone to mix with. When school was in session, they were always busy studying or doing their assignments but tell them to study now and they tell you, \u2018for what, when we don\u2019t know when ASUU will call off their strike.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have been appealing to ASUU to consider the long term consequences of this strike and call off the strike. We know that they are fighting for things to be better but they should also see things from the perspective of us, the parents who are disturbed that the future of our children are being jeopardised.\u201d\n\nMrs. Chinyere Uchendu, on her part, appealed to the federal government and ASUU to resolve the crisis for the future of the children and education in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThree of my children are in the university, but are now back home doing nothing. If this situation is not properly handled, most students could lose focus in life and be made to indulge in social vices, such as internet fraud, armed robbery, banditry and kidnapping, amongst others.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that at the end of the one month warning strike by ASUU, that both ASUU and the federal government would have come to an agreement, but it is really unfortunate that ASUU is going on another two months strike. We strongly believe that it will affect our students and the standard of education in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our children back home; we prefer seeing dialogue between ASUU and the federal government in order to ensure frank talks that will quickly bring the whole problem to an end so that the country continues with sound education policies that will be competitive with international community.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want our children to spend three months at home because of the strike. We are begging the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, go back and resolve their matter with ASUU so that the children can quickly go back to classes.\u201d\n\nStudents\u2019 frustrations\n\nSimilarly, a cross-section of students who spoke with our correspondents in separate interviews expressed their frustrations, saying \u201cthe federal government allowed the strike to linger because it didn\u2019t affect their children, most of who are schooling abroad or attend private universities.\u201d\n\nChinwe Ubani, a 300-level Chemistry Education student of the University of Abuja, said, \u201cThey did all they could to avert the airlines operators from embarking on strike since it would affect them and their children, but ASUU has been on strike since February and it rolled over for another 12 weeks, but who cares? After all, their children don\u2019t even attend public universities.\n\n\u201cThe strike has affected me nearly in every aspect. I practically feel like three months have been deleted out of my life already. I mean, I would have been a graduate today and possibly serving my fatherland. As much as I have been able to do a few things, I would have done a lot more if I had graduated as scheduled. I am losing flair for academics, no thanks to the FG/ASSU situation. To think that I will stay at home for another three month is frustrating.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Enemali Joseph, a student of Federal University Lokoja (FUL), said the strike has devastated him emotionally, putting a cog in the wheel of his dreams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say the prolonged ASUU strike has affected me negatively. It is so because not only has the strike devastated me emotionally, it has also forcefully put me behind my schedule. You can imagine a four-year degree programme which I had hoped to complete in 2020 now dragging to God knows when.\n\n\u201cWith the strike all my plans are shattered and yet I cannot plan further. It has made me less enthusiastic about reading and education. We have also seen crime rates soaring since this industrial action started. Take a look at the social media; it is all about the book of lamentations, report of all sorts of wrong activities occasioned by idleness \u2013 rape, armed robbery, unwanted pregnancies, prostitution and possibly suicides.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that ASUU is fighting to make things better, but there are other ways of making their voice to be heard rather than the strike option. We the students are the ones feeling the brunt of the strike and they should take this into consideration and call off the strike,\u201d he said.\n\nFunke Abolurin, a student of the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria (ABU), regretted being in a system that cost her two years of her academic life.\n\n\u201cWell, at first, the strike was really helpful in a way as it gave us enough room to cover up on some course outline, considering our then tight schedule. Now, it is annoying due to the extension as I have lost all motivation to study again. It has done more harm than good to me. Instead of writing my examination and going to the next level, I am stuck at home, not knowing the next line of action.\n\n\u201cThe strike has been horrible to be honest. I should actually be in my third year now, but due to the country\u2019s messed up educational system, I am still in my first year. I should be preparing for examination, but I am at home instead. The current three months extension by ASUU is affecting my mental health. It is really having a bad effect on my mental health,\u201d she said.\n\nNGOs\u2019 concerns\n\nIn their concerns, some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) told our correspondents that the federal government and ASUU are playing politics with the future of Nigerian students.\n\nThe Convener of Justice for All, Mr. Jude Osaleke, said ASUU and its employers could sort out their differences without making students the victims.\n\n\u201cThe strikes are becoming worrisome. The development does not portray the country in good light before the international community. ASUU and the federal government are playing politics with the future of young Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe strikes are causing the youth to lose faith in education and consequently take to negative vices that may compromise their future. This development is dangerous to us as a nation. It does not speak well of us as a nation that truly desires accelerated development and transformation.\n\n\u201cThe government should tackle this issue. It must go down to work, and quickly too, to revisit whatever demands the lecturers are making. I understand that the government is saying that it cannot afford to meet the demands of the 2009 agreement entered into, by the then government, with ASUU. But in seeking to revisit the agreement, there must be genuine commitment toward ensuring a lasting solution.\n\n\u201cAll parties should be committed to finding a common ground to the issues so that we can get the children back to the classrooms because it is the parents that bear the brunt of the impasse.\u201d\n\nAlso, the president, Civil Rights Realisation and Advancement Network, Mr. Olu Omotayo, said the development was a grave danger to tertiary education in the country.\n\nHe said the inability of ASUU and the federal government to resolve the labour dispute was capable of stagnating whatever economic gains the current administration had made.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, you cannot talk about development without education and security.\n\nHe said it was worrisome that the politicians were busy talking about politics and restrategising on how to win elections while students were idling away at home.\n\n\u201cThey are creating problems that will haunt us in the future. Some of these students might be forced to join bad groups, thereby increasing the crime rate in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market.

If we fail in all those areas, you won\u2019t even get them to come here.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is one aspect of our life. The other aspect is what we do.

Let us not wait until a few weeks to the election before we realise that time is not on our side and begin to seek for extension of timelines. The time to act is now. We wish to reassure the security agencies that we will continue to work cooperatively with you to ensure the success of all forthcoming elections and electoral activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yakubu, the commission is also preparing for two off-cycle governorship elections in Ekiti State (June 18) and Osun State (July 16).\n\nHe added that it has pending bye-elections in 18 constituencies across the country comprising three senatorial districts, one federal constituency, and 14 state constituencies.\n\nThe INEC boss stated that as political parties end their primaries on June 3 with candidates emerging, campaigns in public by political parties would commence nationwide as provided by the timetable for the election, in line with the provision of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAs a result, he said the electoral umpire and security agencies have their work clearly cut out,\n\n\u201cWe have tasked our Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to provide basic data on areas of security challenges in their states, including citizens living in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to harvest the data as a basis for further engagement with the security agencies, as well as devising the best way to provide electoral services to all Nigerians under all circumstances.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja bade farewell to outgoing members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), affirming that a significant number of them have been sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President.\n\nSpeaking at a valedictory session for appointees leaving the cabinet to pursue political ambitions, the President said:\n\n\u201dI have no doubt that if the next President emerges from among former members of this cabinet, like any other aspirant, ample competence and outstanding service delivery would be on display. This will be part of our legacies to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe President, who commended the departing public officers for serving the nation sacrificially, \u201dwith dignity and honour\u201d, had at the last FEC meeting on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 directed that all Ministers and other political appointees who aspire to contest for elective offices in the 2023 General Elections should resign their current appointments.\n\n\u201dI note that some have complied while others are in the process of doing so.https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197057&action=edit#\n\n\u201dI would like to use this opportunity to commend your decision and courage to contest for elective offices and your compliance with my directive.\n\n\u201dI also wish to thank you for your invaluable services to this nation through your contributions as Cabinet members.\n\n\u201dI wish you success in the upcoming elections and in your future endeavours,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the ministers that looking back as the head of the team over the years, he had fond memories of incisive and robust discussions during cabinet meetings, rendering of performance reports during special sessions and presidential retreats.\n\n\u201dIn 2015, citizens of this country overwhelmingly voted for me to become the President of this nation on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197057&action=edit#\n\n\u201dSelecting members of the Cabinet went through a careful process so that the best and most competent could emerge. The performance of that class of 2015 proved me right.\n\n\u201dIn 2019, Nigerians similarly re-elected me as President. Again the selection went through another meticulous process.\n\n\u201dThat re-election was significant because it served as a referendum on our performance during the first term and it inspired me to bring back some of the members of the first cabinet either to their old Ministries or re-assigned to other sectors.\n\n\u201dNew Members were also brought on board to inject fresh energies, skills and ideas to enhance the execution of government\u2019s programs and policies.\n\n\u201dWith these and much more, I am happy to note that a significant number of cabinet members have become sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President. This shows the impact of the experience gathered while serving as members of the Federal Executive Council,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President acknowledged that prior to some of them joining his cabinet; they had made their marks in other areas as governors, legislators, entrepreneurs and core professionals.\n\nHe added that the experience and expertise they brought on board have significantly resulted in enormous development in various sectors and the accomplishment of government programmes.\n\n\u201dThese include infrastructure, agriculture, health systems, financial management, administration of justice, building social safety net systems,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that the departure of some cabinet members has undoubtedly created a vacuum that should be filled, the President said appointments would be made without delay so that the business of governance will not suffer.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the remaining members of the cabinet to show more diligence, resilience and commitment to serve Nigerians better, saying \u2018\u2018the journey to the finish line is still very far \u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201dLike always, there will be challenges to address, programmes to deliver and policies to implement.\n\n\u201dYou must therefore brace up for more work and target increased accomplishments.\n\n\u201dThe determination to leave important legacies for Nigerians should never be compromised,\u201d the President told members of his cabinet.\n\nThe following outgoing members of FEC were present at the valedictory session: ministers of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige.\n\nOthers are the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen and the Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Tayo Alasoadura.\n\nThe Minister of State (Education), Emeka Nwajiuba, who had earlier tendered his resignation, was not present at the valedictory session.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the outgoing ministers, Akpabio thanked the President for giving them the opportunity to serve and contribute their quota to nation building.\n\nHe described working with the President as a \u2018\u2018fantastic and knowledgeable experience,\u2019\u2019 adding that as they step aside they will continue to be great disciples of Buhari.\n\n\u201dAs we step aside from FEC, I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism.\n\n\u201dI want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the Minister of Information and Culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, administrative sagacity to Nigerians, \u201d he said.\n\nThe Niger Delta Minister told the President that from his interactions with colleagues leaving the cabinet was like the story of the Spanish play of \u2018\u2018sadness and joy.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201dSadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a Father and learning from him; joy because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country. \u201d\n\nLauding the President\u2019s deep patriotism, Akpabio said he is the \u201dbest president Nigeria could ever have had at a time of difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe prayed God Almighty to grant the President a successful tenure and protect his family, adding:\n\n\u201dMay one of us succeed you in order to continue the good legacies you have laid on ground. We have seen and know your vision. We know where you want the country to be.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammdu Buhari had on Wednesday during the Federal Excutive Council meeting directed all ministers and political appointees with Political ambition to resign on or before the 16th of May 2022.",
