          "text": "Six states reported 1,786 suspected cases of cholera between June 20 and June 26, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said in Abuja on Saturday.\n\nNCDC Director-General, Dr.Chikwe Ihekweazu, listed the states as Bauchi, 1,239 cases; Kano, 362 cases; Niger, 62 cases; Zamfara, 55 cases; Kaduna, 59 cases and Plateau, nine cases.\n\nHe told the News Agency of Nigeria that in the preceding week of June 13 to June 19, five states, namely, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau and Zamfara reported 1,757 suspected cases.\n\nBauchi State reported 900 cases, Kano State reported 575 cases, Kaduna State reported 70 cases, Plateau reported 98 cases, while Zamfara reported 114 cases.\n\nIhekweazu said that between January 2021 and June 27, a total of 14,343 suspected cases of cholera were reported from 15 states and the FCT.\n\nThis, he added, included 325 deaths.\n\nThe affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross-River, Nasarawa, Niger and the FCT.\n\nNCDC\u2019s Situation Report on cholera indicates that 27.6 per cent of victims across the country are those in the five years to 14 years bracket.\n\nThe report also indicates that 51 per cent of the suspected cases and male, while 49 per cent are female.\n\nIhekweazu also told NAN that a multi-sectorial national Emergency Operations Centre coordinates the cholera national response activities.\n\n\u201cThe EOC is co-led by the Federal Ministry of Environment and that of Water Resources given the link between cholera, water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\n\u201cThe centre has been supporting states to ensure a coordinated, rapid and effective response to the current outbreak.\n\n\u201cThis includes the deployment of National Rapid Response Teams to support the response at the state level, provision of medical and laboratory supplies, and scale-up of risk communications amongst other activities,\u2019\u2019 he explained.\n\nIhekweazu said that the NCDC would continue to support states to intensify their cholera outbreak responses, noting that the risk of death from cholera was higher when treatment was delayed.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to boil and store water in clean and safe containers before drinking. And to wash their hands frequently with soap under clean running water to prevent infectious diseases like cholera.\n\n\u201cThis is especially important after defecation and before handling food or eating,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nCholera is a preventable and treatable epidemic-prone disease transmitted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nIncidence of cholera tends to increase during the rainy season.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The Federal Government has inaugurated a 10-man committee to resolve the dispute between the Kaduna State government and the Nigeria Labour Congress and ensure industrial harmony in the state.\n\nA statement issued by a Deputy Director in the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr Charles Akpan, on Saturday in Abuja, said that the committee was inaugurated by Minister, Sen. Chris Ngige.\n\nThe committee was headed by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Dr Peter-Yemira Tarfa.\n\nNgige named Secretary to Kaduna State Government, Balarabe Lawal; and Deputy National President, NLC, Najim Hashim; as Co-chairmen of the committee and Director, Trade Union Services and Industrial Relations, ministry of labour and employment, Mrs O. U. Akpan, as Secretary.\n\nHe urged members of the committee to meet the expectations of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) in ensuring that industrial peace returned to the state.\n\nThe minister recalled that the federal government had apprehended the strike initiated by NLC in the state in May, with parties signing a Memorandum of Understanding to restore peace.\n\nHe said that the intervening circumstances had made the reconstitution of the committee inevitable.\n\nAccording to him, the committee is expected to resolve all the issues in dispute between the state government and NLC.\n\nNgige, who acknowledged that the issues in contention bordered essentially on trade disputes, gave the committee 21 days to submit its report.\n\nHe urged the committee to resolve the issues holistically and be guided by the 1999 Constitution (as amended) as well as the country\u2019s labour laws.\n\nNgige noted that downsizing or rightsizing of workforce in any organisation, government or private sector, was a redundancy issue, which must be subjected to the principles spelt out in the Trade Disputes Act, Laws of the Federation, 2004, Cap L1.\n\n\u201cThe law says in Section 20(A) that: \u201cin the event of redundancy, every employer shall inform the trade unions or representatives of workers concerned of the reasons for or the extent of their anticipated redundancy.\n\n\u201cSection 20(B) also says that the principles of \u2018last-in, first-out\u2019 shall be adopted in the discharge of the category of workers affected, subject to all factors of relative merit including skill, ability and any reliability.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, in applying this, we must subject it to the relativity of merit, skill, ability and reliability. If somebody has a forged certificate, he should be asked to go because he didn\u2019t merit the job in the first instance.\n\n\u201cIf you go to a nursing home and find somebody working in the ward with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in History, he stands disqualified because he doesn\u2019t have the skill in the first place.\n\n\u201cHe has to go. So, these are the qualifications that must be noted in this principle of last in, first out. It is not absolute. It has exceptions and qualifications,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nNgige added that an employer had the right to reduce staff strength of his organisation but he is bound by law to negotiate redundancy payment with any discharged worker.\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "Jackie Moore breezes away",
          "text": "By Emeka Obasi\n\nMore than anything else soccer and music healed wounds of the Civil War faster than what was tagged Three Rs by General Yakubu Gowon. Enugu Rangers Football club came after the war. Music led Biafrans from war to peace.\n\nJackie Moore Anyaora was all over the place hanging a guitar round his neck. He was with Salt and Pepper Organisation before teaming up with his townsman, Stone Face Iwuagwu at Life Everlasting with Dallas Anyanwu, Roy Obika and Jimi Henshaw in 1973. Tony Okoroji was there too.\n\nIn 1977, Sweet Breeze stormed the entertainment scene. The group was set up by Jackie Moore, Dallas, fellow students of the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu, Bazy Cole Akalonu, Nestor Phillips and University of Nigeria Nsukka Political Science graduate, Vincent Ikeotuonye.\n\nJackie Moore\u2019s voice wowed everyone. Sweet Breeze hit the chart with tracks like \u2018She is my choice\u2019, \u2018Palm wine taper\u2019 and \u2018 Igbara aka bia ilum\u2019, the Igbo lyrics animated even women in the village because it was all about the need to be loaded before asking for a lady\u2019s hand in marriage.\n\nSweet Breeze later split, like many groups in the 1970s. What came out of it was Esbee Family. Jackie Moore and Dallas moved to the United States and were able to further their education, earning doctorate degrees from Pace University, New York.\n\nI was shocked midweek when Frank Fyne, another post war great, announced the passage of Jackie Moore. He died on July 4, 2002 aged 66 just as Yankees were celebrating their Independence anniversary.\n\nRelocating overseas sat well with many of the Igbo musicians who survived the war. I think it began with the Funkees of Jake Solo( Nkem Okonkwo) and Harry Mosco Agada. Then Bob Miga( Valentine Soroibe Agim) followed. Larry Ifedioranma of Ofo the Black Company joined the train.\n\nLarry\u2019s younger brother, Dig Ifedioranma took the same route. I met Dig in Bankstown, Sydney, Australia in 2000. He lives there with his wife Lyn and their children Kelechi, Tonna, Ndidi and Chima. They moved from Lagos in the 1980s.\n\nLyn told me she met her husband in London in 1976 and was so much in love with Nigeria. They returned to Lagos and spent six years before choosing Australia. Kelechi and Tonna were born in Nigeria and even in Sydney the woman was so proud to move about in Nigerian dress.\n\nShe talked about the good days in Nigeria. Of course, it was music that gave her Dig and Dig was part of the wipe -your- tears musicians who made the Eastern part of Nigeria fun to be in the 1970s.\n\nAs a boy, I remember Biafran soldiers used music as energiser in the absence of weapons. Listening to war songs could drive boys to the battle field without any fear. The Commando band was so entertaining that many forgot that beyond entertainment there was danger.\n\nI remember seeing soldiers dance away their sorrows any time they gained a pass. Jam sessions were known as \u2018bongo\u2019, \u2018okolo\u2019 or \u2018 nkurutu nkurutu\u2019 in my dialect of the Igbo language. Songs were done with \u2018enemy plane, armoured car, shore battery\u2019 and more.\n\nThere were bands like Fractions featuring Travis Oti, Stoneface Iwuagwu, Ify Jiagbogu. I remember Hykkers, Biafra Air Force Wings of Dan Ian( Damian Mbaezue), Gab Ozoani and Arinze Okpala and there were the Jets who according to Iheanyi Ochor, were stationed at Oguta.\n\nALSO READ: The Dove which triumphed over hawks and vultures: The Kaunda story\n\nWar over, music became food of love and healing. Two groups hit it big in terms of acceptance. Bob Miga and the Strangers came out with the unbeatable \u2018Love Rock\u2019. He had left Hykkers and decided to stay put in Owerri when others headed to Lagos.\n\nThen came Wrinkar Experience with their evergreen \u2018Fuel for Love\u2019. The true story of this group has to be told. And it has a strong Cameroonian touch. Ginger Forcha who today is a big time Preacher man was reluctant to blow his trumpet but I got the story.\n\nForcha said : \u201c Ok, you\u2019re almost in the kingdom. I and my bass guitarist and co singer founded the Wrinkar Experience before the late Dan Ian came to join us some time later.\u201d\n\nWinkar, I understand was a Cameroonian lady. It was from her that the name Wrinkar Experience emerged. There was also Edjo\u2019o Jacques Racine. Cameroon continued to play roles later through Nsusie Enonoa of Doves and Prince Nico Mbarga, who lived in Onitsha and turned the world round with his \u2018Sweet Mother\u2019.\n\nThere were musicians all over the East. Lasbrey Ojukwu and his Semi Colon blasted from Umuahia. Walton Arungwa and Chyke Fusion became Apostles in Aba. Port Harcourt haboured Iyke Peters and Marshall Udeoru of Founders 15. Soki Ohale was there too with Ceejays.\n\nSpud Nathan and Manford Best wore Wings. Wahehe Njoku sang with Rock of Ages. Jerry Boifraind picked Genesis. Action performed from Warri. Sammy Mathews and Ani Hofnar Umebuani spoke with One World. Peacocks and Oriental Brothers gave us Highlife and Voice of Cross praised the Lord. Ndigbo survived.\n\nGoodluck Maurice Anyaora, better known as Jackie Moore hailed from Umunkwo, Mbano in Imo State. War caused him to move from Stella Maris College, Port Harcourt to Holy Ghost College , Owerri. That is the school of Dan Ian, Charlie Boy, Patrick Ekeji, Okey Isima and Emma Merenini.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Incidents of Gender-Based Violence have continued to top the chart of discourse among stakeholders, despite efforts by the government to check the threat.\n\nAlthough campaigns to end gender-based violence have intensified, experts say the crime persists due to lack of requisite punishment for offenders.\n\nGender advocates on their part attribute its rise to the slow dispensation of justice in the trial of sexual offenders.\n\nGBV is a crime committed against an individual for the reason of their gender or crime unduly targeted at persons of a specific sex.\n\nA Nigerian Gender-Based Violence sub-sector report (GBVIMS Mid-Year Report) for 2020 said 99% of all incidents of GBV affected women and girls.\n\nViolence against women and girls may include but not limited to physical, sexual, verbal, financial or mental abuse, rape, defilement, sodomisation, coercion and deprivation of liberty.\n\nIn Nigeria, about 30% of women and girls between the ages of 15-49 experience different forms of sexual abuse according to reports.\n\nGov. Ugwuanyi inaugurates committee on prevention of gender-based violence\n\nThe GBVIMS report revealed that sexual violence such as rape and assault accounted for 17% of the total incidents reported.\n\nIt said, \u2018\u201821% of reported incidents were perpetrated against children, on average 1 in every 5 reports were from children. Out of all cases reported by children, 29% was made by unaccompanied and separated children. 48% of the incidents reported by children was an incident of sexual violence\u201d.\n\nHowever, these numbers do not reflect the number of convictions obtained for survivors, according to experts.\n\n13-year-old Uduak, (not real name) says her mother did not report sexual abuse against her to the police because her stepfather convinced her not to, claiming nothing would be done.\n\nUduak\u2019s older step-sibling, 22 years old Akpan had defiled her in their home when she was 12. Their parents were away on a trip and had left her and three other younger ones alone with him.\n\nAkpan has since the incident vanished into thin air according to Mama Uduak, leaving her no room to pursue the matter while she and her children now live in the suburbs of FCT, away from her estranged husband.\n\nMama Uduak said she left the marriage and regrets marrying the man and taking in his children from a previous marriage as her own.\n\nThis situation is just one unreported case, which may have left the child traumatised for life but there are many other reported cases where justice has still not been served.\n\nIn 2020, the Nigeria Police said it received over 717 reports of rape in five months, between January and May of that year; these numbers allude to the gravity of the situation in the country.\n\nIn April 2021, the Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen revealed that only 11 out of over 3,000 cases of SGBV reported in six states were prosecuted.\n\nIn the FCT alone, a total of 444 SGBV cases were recorded, 443 of them are reportedly still hanging in various courts over bottlenecks.\n\nA desk officer at the FCT sexual and gender-based violence response team, Mrs Ngozi Ike said only one conviction was secured out of all the reported cases.\n\nShe had revealed this at a media dialogue on Advocacy to Eliminate Violence against Women organized by the Spotlight Initiative Nigeria.\n\nIke attributed the lack of requisite punishment for offenders to corruption by security operatives who sit on cases making sure they never go to trial.\n\n\u201dGBV cases persist because offenders are not punished as they should\u201d she said.\n\nShe believes the creation of special courts for GBV will help fast track the trial of offenders as regular courts appear rather too busy for such cases.\n\n\u2018\u2018We lack special courts in Nigeria to hear such delicate cases. When you take these cases to the regular courts, they linger for long periods and this is not good at all.\n\n\u2018\u2018Creation of special courts to try sexual and domestic violence offenders will help in dispensing justice to survivors, \u201d Ike says, because even cases that make it to regular courts may never be heard.\n\n\u2018\u2018Expressing indignation when asked to react to the FCT GBV numbers, Dr Ifeanyi Lawson, a Psychologist explained that the trauma around GBV and the lack of justice for survivors has increased the number of \u2018\u2018mentally distressed\u2019\u2019 adult females.\n\n\u2018\u2018Imagine being violated and knowing that the person who did you wrong is walking free and probably doing same to other people and you cannot do anything about it, that is mental torture, says Dr Lawson.\n\nMeanwhile, Tochukwu Odele, a Child Protection Officer at UNICEF, who also spoke at the advocacy dialogue, said the political structure of Nigeria constituted a barrier to gender laws implementation.\n\nShe said a survey indicated that many children, who experienced GBV, did so at home, while those who grow up in violent environments risk becoming violent adults themselves.\n\nNow, experts and advocates against Gender-Based Violence say the consequences of lack of justice for survivors of GBV have been fatal in many instances.\n\nA 2017 study by the Society for Family health indicates that GBV \u2018\u2018leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality, including gynaecological problems, sexually transmitted infections, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance dependence, suicide and mortality.\n\nUgwuanyi\u2019s wife campaigns against gender-based violence in Enugu State",

          "text": "By Bisi Olaniyi, Southsouth Bureau Chief\n\nOba disagrees with governor on destination, says artifacts not Edo govt\u2019s property\n\nFG sets August 2022 for full return of 1,130 stolen Benin bronzes from Germany\n\nThe faceoff between the Oba of Benin, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019 Oba N\u2019 Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, and Governor Godwin Obaseki over the return to Benin of the looted artifacts from Europe deepened on Friday, with the first-class monarch raising the alarm over attempts to divert the destination/right of custody of the stolen cultural heritage.\n\nThe eminent monarch declared at the well-attended meeting with palace chiefs and Enigies on the repatriation of the looted Benin artifacts that they (artifacts) were not the property of Edo State Government or any private corporate entity that was not the creation of Benin Kingdom.\n\nHe condemned the activities of the Obaseki-backed \u201cso-called\u201d Legacy Restoration Trust Limited and the \u201cpurported\u201d establishment of Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nThe traditional ruler called on the Federal Government to take custody of the artifacts on behalf of the palace of Benin kingdom until the Benin Royal Museum was ready for their collection, declaring that under no circumstance should custody of Benin kingdom\u2019s age-old artifacts be handed to any privately-contrived entity like the Legacy Restoration Trust Limited.\n\nHe said in his palace: \u201cI called this meeting to intimate you of the matter of the Benin artifacts in Europe at the verge of being repatriated. You may have heard about the recent activities of a group of individuals, who incorporated a company since January 2020 called Legacy Restoration Trust Limited.\n\n\u201cIt has become germane to note that the advocacy and demands for the return of the artifacts looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897 have been going on for decades before the emergence of the incumbent Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki.\n\n\u201cI must sincerely thank the governor for joining the struggle and showing commitment to retrieve our stolen cultural heritage from Europe.\n\n\u201cWhile anticipating the return of the looted artifacts from Europe, I want to note that attempts to divert the destination or the right of custody of the artifacts is not in the interest of the people of Benin Kingdom to whom the Palace of the Oba of Benin provides leadership.\n\n\u201cThe looted artifacts awaiting repatriation from Europe are the cultural heritage of the Benin Kingdom, created by our ancestors and forefathers within the traditional norms and rites of the kingdom. They are not the property of Edo State Government or any private corporate entity that is not a creation of the Benin Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe right and only legitimate destination for the artifacts to be repatriated, as already pronounced by my father, is under the aegis of the Benin Royal Museum that will be sited within the precincts of the Palace of the Oba of Benin from where they were looted, and also the proper traditional institution that is also the custodian of all the cultural heritage of the Benin Kingdom.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe Palace, therefore, strongly advises that anyone, group, organisation or government \u2013 national and international, that is dealing with any organisation or artificial group in the process of returning the looted artifacts from the Benin Kingdom would be doing so at their own risk and against the will of the people of the Benin Kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe first-class monarch also declared that there was no alternative native authority and custodian of the cultural heritage of the Benin kingdom outside the Oba of Benin, as constituted by the royal palace.\n\nHe said: \u201cI do not believe that the move by a privately-registered company, the Legacy Restoration Trust Limited and the purported establishment of Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) are in consonance with the wishes of the people of Benin Kingdom.\u201d\n\nFG sets August 2022 for full return of 1,130 stolen bronzes\n\nThe Federal Government says the full return of the 1,130 stolen Benin Bronzes from Germany should be completed by August 2022.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed proposed the one-year time limit during a round-table with German Museum Directors and government officials in Berlin, Germany.\n\nA statement on the round-table was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday by Mr Segun Adeyemi, Special Assistant to the President (Media) in the Office of the Minister.\n\nAs contained in the statement, the minister is leading a Nigerian government delegation for high-level talks with German government officials on the repatriation of the artifacts.\n\nMohammed said Germany had agreed to repatriate the antiquities which were looted from the Bini Kingdom in 1897, and the agreement for the return must be signed by December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor us, the most important issue in the road map is the signing of the agreement and the date of return.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t move forward if we don\u2019t have a clear date on signing and return, and full return should be completed in a year\u2019s time, not beyond August 2022,\u201d he told participants at the round-table.\n\nMohammed said Nigerians were eagerly awaiting the return of the 1,130 Benin bronzes, which were being held by various museums in Germany.\n\nHe said the German Federal Government was coordinating the return of the Benin bronzes, mostly held by state and private museums.\n\nHe noted that of the 6,600 museums in Germany, less than five per cent are owned by the Federal Government.\n\nSpeaking at the roundtable, the Secretary of State in the German President\u2019s office, Mr Stephen Steinlein, said the President was happy with the progress made so far on the planned repatriation of the artifacts.\n\nHe described the planned return of the artifacts as \u201da lighthouse project\u201d and assured that the President would continue to follow the process keenly.\n\nThe Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki, who is also part of the Nigerian delegation, told the roundtable that work was set to begin on the building of a museum that would hold the artifacts when they were repatriated.\n\nObaseki said the building tagged \u201cEdo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), located in Benin City, was part of a transformation project being planned to make the city a cultural hub.\n\nAs contained in the statement, the architect handling the museum project, Sir David Adjaye, made a presentation to the roundtable.\n\nAdjaye said the project would fuse the technology of ancient Benin Kingdom into that of the 21st Century to get an organic pavilion that would boast an auditorium, storage as well as exhibition space, among other facilities.\n\nThe statement also revealed that the Nigerian delegation met with representatives of Ethnologisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem, where a select number of Benin bronzes, some of them dating back to the 16th century, were on display.\n\nMembers of the delegation as listed in the statement included the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr Yusuf Tuggar, the Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Prof. Abba Tijani.\n\nBenin Crown Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare and Director of the Board, Legacy Restoration Trust, Mr Phillip Ihenacho, were also in the delegation.",

          "text": "Ayetoro, an oil producing community in Ondo State, is on the verge of going into extinction. For more than a decade, the people have watched helplessly as their homes, means of livelihood and valuables are destroyed by ocean surge. Many elderly members of the community are said to have died of shock after losing all they had laboured for because of the problem. The people are pained that the federal government has continued to earn revenue from the community through oil exploration but has flagrantly ignored their pleas for help, INNOCENT DURU reports.\n\nElderly indigenes suffer shock, die of high blood pressure\n\nHow failed NDDC contracts compounded community\u2019s woes\n\nState, federal government officials dodge enquiry\n\nWhen Kayode Okenla, an indigene of Ayetoro, a riverine community in Ondo State completed the construction of his seven-bedroom apartment recently, it was in the hope that he would never worry again about paying rent. Like a bed set free from the hunter\u2019s snare, he leaped in ecstasy, punching the air repeatedly in full admiration of his personal accomplishment.\n\n\u201cThis is great!\u201d he said gleefully to himself. His status also changed instantly as friends, associates and family members teased him with the title of the latest landlord in town.\n\nBut his joy was short-lived as an ocean surge, a menace the community has contended with for more than a decade reared its ugly head again. Before his very eyes, Kayode watched helplessly as the sea launched a ferocious attack on his exquisite building, sweeping away everything in it with the force of a hurricane.\n\n\u201cFrom a proud owner of a well-furnished seven-bedroom building that cost me more than N7 million, I have suddenly become homeless,\u201d he said regretfully. \u201cI have already relocated to my mother\u2019s house, but I suffered high blood pressure after the incident.\u201d\n\nBesides the building, Kayode also lost some fish ponds he had in the premises as well as his farm located close to the building.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I would experience a loss of that magnitude. Everything I lost put together would be worth more than N15 million,\u201d he said.\n\nChecks made across the community revealed that the hitherto lively area had become a shadow of itself. The sea, which had provided many of them with means of livelihood, had turned against them like a dreaded foe. Carcasses of buildings destroyed by the sea surge littered the area.\n\nAnd it would seem that the sea was not done yet with its rage in spite of the enormous havoc it had wreaked. The more it looked at its victims, the more furious and itchy it appeared set to do more damage.\n\nAt regular intervals, waters from the sea converge on a spot like street gangsters and fiercely barge into the community. Each time they do, more houses and other valuables are destroyed, more residents are displaced and more tears rolled down the cheeks of the people.\n\nFor Kayode, the possibility of building another house is high because he is a young man. But the same cannot be said of 74-year-old Pa Emmanuel Lemamu who also lost the house he had struggled to build during his youthful days.\n\n\u201cI have become a refugee in my own land. I am no more in my own house. I am telling you the truth and nothing but the truth. Hundreds of houses have been destroyed in Ayetoro now. I built my house in 1956 but when the sea incursion came, it pulled down the building,\u201d he said with a grimace.\n\n\u201cThe damage is going on as we speak. Many people are packing the few of their belongings they can salvage from their houses destroyed by the sea incursion. Many of them are looking for where to stay now. I have been squatting in a friend\u2019s house with my wife and children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have joy here in Ayetoro. We can\u2019t sleep all night because we have to stay awake to guard our families and our few belongings from being swept away when the sea rages.\u201d\n\nPa Lemmamu, who is the head of Paul Apostle Church, is fortunate to be among the survivors. Many of his peers who had similar experience were said to have developed high blood pressure and died.\n\n\u201cMany old people who were victims have died. It was high blood pressure that caused their death. Many who lost their buildings and valuables to the incursion have died because they didn\u2019t know where to start from again.\n\n\u201cMany of them were worried over where to get money to build another house, because the cost of building was not so high back then compared to what obtains now. To build a house in Ayetoro now will cost millions and not thousands as it was in the past.\u201d\n\nThe septuagenarian\u2019s assertion was corroborated by the youths\u2019 secretary in the community, Emmanuel Aralu.\n\nAralu said: \u201cWe lost one person to the incursion about four or five years ago, but it has claimed many lives indirectly. By this I mean that many men and women of 60 and 70 years and above who had their buildings destroyed by the sea incursion developed high blood pressure and died.\n\n\u201cFor younger victims there is still hope that they can bounce back and build another house. But for old people, there is little or no hope of bouncing back. Before their own eyes, they watched all they had laboured for washed away by the sea incursion.\n\n\u201cPeople who had large houses suddenly turned to squatting in one-room apartments. Psychologically they are down. Such people are automatically half human beings. Many of them developed high blood pressure and other illnesses and died as I earlier said.\n\n\u201cThat is why I said the death rate in the community has increased as a result of the incessant incursion of the sea.\n\nMore troubles for embattled community\n\nAside from losing their houses and valuables to the raging sea, findings revealed many members of the community have also lost their means of livelihood to the challenge. Their accommodation problems have been compounded by the challenge of what to eat, among others.\n\n\u201cOur economy has also been badly affected. Before, we had fish ponds and places where we used to smoke fish, but we can\u2019t do all that again. The sea has washed everything away. Our people have lost their means of livelihood.\n\n\u201cEven those who are even going into the ocean are no longer making enough catches. There are no more fishes in the ocean as a result of the incursion. Crayfish which we even used to catch in the past are no longer there.\n\n\u201cFishing is our major occupation here in Ayetoro, but we have lost it to the sea incursion,\u201d Pa Lemmamu said.\n\nThe challenge, he added, has also robbed them of access to potable water.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have potable water. They used to bring bags of pure (sachet) water from Igbokoda Waterside to Ayetoro for us to buy. It is the community that buys water for members of the community who cannot afford to buy it.\n\n\u201cThe primary school in the community has been relocated more than three times. The community is just arranging a place for the children to have where they can read. The secondary school pupils have been brought together in one place.\n\n\u201cThe major road that we often use has been affected by the incursion. The incursion, which used to happen occasionally, now happens every day.\u201d\n\nAnother leading member of the community, Mrs Ibilola Akinluwa, also bemoaned the effects of the challenge on business and the vulnerable ones, especially women and children.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is also having a telling effect on our businesses. Whenever the sea incursion occurs, those who have shops would lose everything they have. It always sweeps away their deep freezers and other valuables.\n\n\u201cWhen this happens, nobody can go and recover those things from the raging sea. Anybody that tries that will be swept away. The rage of the sea is better imagined than experienced.\n\n\u201cWhen it came recently, it was the able bodied men that helped to rescue the children who were helpless and confounded at the sight of the problem. But for the grace of God, the children would have been swept away.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhen a pregnant woman experiences this kind of thing, you can imagine the psychological effect it would have on her.\n\n\u201cPlease, we are begging, they should come and do the piling for us so that our mind can be at rest. We have many children and there is nowhere to go. It is becoming unbearable for us.\u201d\n\nCommunity laments alleged neglect by government\n\nThe pains of the people are aggravated by the deafening silence of government at all levels in respect of their plight. They regretted that exploration has continued in the axis without any attempt to address their problem.\n\n\u201cWe have been begging the government all these years to come to our aid. We have been begging them to come and use stones to stop the incursion but they are not responding,\u201d Pa Lemmamu said.\n\nGoing down memory lane, he said: \u201cI can remember when this community was founded in 1947, Ayetoro was very far away from the sea side. But when multinational oil companies began to erect their equipment in the area around 2002 on our offshore, erosion and incursion started to take place.\n\n\u201cAlthough I am not educated, from the local intelligence that God gave people like me, we found out that the activities of multinational oil companies are compounding the environmental problems we are facing here.\n\n\u201cThe sea incursion often occurs around 1 am and 2 am. We almost lost two children to a recent incident.\u201d\n\nThe youths\u2019 secretary, Aralu, said the whole problem started about 10 years ago but has been so drastic and consistent in the last three years.\n\n\u201cEvery one of us is skeptical and in pain. The whole community is almost getting to the point of being desolate. Buildings worth millions and property worth millions have been lost to the incursion.\n\n\u201cPreviously, the incursion used to take place on a monthly basis, but it has now become a daily occurrence. We sleep with it, wake up with it and even dine with it.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even identify what we can do now to ameliorate the problem because it is beyond our control. We have cried out and written letters to the government. We have made a series of efforts for the government of the day to hear our cry but nothing is forthcoming. All we get is promise upon promise.\n\n\u201cIt is so sad and embarrassing for an oil producing community to be going through this without any help.\u201d\n\nThe problem, according to Aralu, is affecting not only Ayetoro but the entire Ilaje.\n\n\u201cIlaje is the base of oil production in Ondo State. It is this area that gave Ondo State the opportunity of being one of the oil producing states in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nKayode, who lost his seven-bedroom flat to the problem, wonders if there is a government in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe development here makes me feel there is no government in the country. Nobody has come to our help. I think the activities of the oil companies aided the sea incursion that is ravaging our community.\n\n\u201cWe have always called press conferences to make our plight public. We have also shared the videos of the incident on Facebook hoping that the government and relevant authorities would see it and do something about our plight, but nobody has done anything.\n\n\u201cThe only help we have received is a small bed spread, mattress, garri and five-kilogramme rice. What can five kilogrammes of rice do for my family? We received that from NEMA.\u201d\n\nMrs Ibilola Akinluwa, the woman leader of the church in the community, was close to tears as she pleaded for government\u2019s assistance.\n\nAkinluwa said: \u201cThe sea incursion is affecting us seriously and we don\u2019t have anywhere to go. We are begging the federal government to come and help us. The problem is becoming unbearable and nobody has had any rest of mind since the problem started.\n\n\u201cWhen the sea rises, nobody will be able to sleep. When it comes, everybody, including children, will be seized by fear. The sea incursion often happens in the night and often rises as high as a building. When this happens, it would start breaking our houses. Half of the town is already gone.\n\n\u201cMany people have been displaced by the problem. It is those who have not been affected that are accommodating many of the victims now. Most houses are now overcrowded. An apartment that would ordinarily take five people is now being occupied by 10 or more people, with many children.\n\n\u201cPlease, please, please, we are begging. Let the government come and assist us. They said they wanted to come and pile the sea for us but they never did. We have been crying for all these years.\n\n\u201cPlease, we are begging you in the name of Jesus so that the sea incursion will not wipe us out.\n\n5,000 residents displaced, 400 houses destroyed \u2013 Community\u2019s spokesman\n\nSpokesman of the community, Prince Victor Akinluwa, said more than 400 houses had been destroyed, with more than 5,000 people displaced by the incident.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have about 400 houses that have been destroyed and that made our people to be displaced. Our people are cramped in the remaining houses.\n\n\u201cThis is the coronavirus period but we cannot maintain physical distancing here because a house where six people were living in before now accommodates about 50 people. Many people have migrated to the upland to stay with their relations.\n\n\u201cWe had people staying by the roadside but the community has created makeshift structures for them. If this continues, Ayetoro has no future. If Ayetoro goes into extinction, it will definitely affect the whole Ilaje nation, because Ayetoro is like a channel to the entire Ilaje nation.\n\n\u201cWe need government intervention. Somebody was talking about relocation the other time, but this is our natural habitat. We cannot be relocated from it. Our main occupation is fishing. Anybody who is thinking of relocating us must relocate the sea with us.\u201d\n\nFederal lawmaker begs government\n\nA federal lawmaker representing Akinjo Ilaje/Ese-odo Federal Constituency, Ondo State, Hon. Kolade Victor, had earlier written an open letter to the government in this newspaper about the predicament of his people. But in spite of his position and influence, the people remain neglected.\n\nHis letter read in part: \u201cI am constrained to write this open letter to draw your attention to the plights of the people of Ayetoro in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cSince my presence in the Eighth and Ninth Assemblies, several motions have personally and severally been moved concerning the parlous state of this oil producing Niger Delta community. The motions are of urgent national importance, calling the attention of the federal government to the recurring sea surge which threatens the community to near extinction.\n\n\u201cThe issue here is about the safety and welfare of the people under your leadership; it is about life and death for all of us from the coastal region of Ondo State. This issue can no longer be ignored or be treated with laxity or tepidity; neither can it be swept under the carpet.\n\n\u201cIt is heavily hitting at the very foundation of our existence as Nigerians and fast eroding the root of our oil-producing communities in Ondo State. Consequently, I am deeply worried that we are now standing on a precipice where we may no longer be able to hold the monstrous sea incursion at bay.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, the lawmaker said: \u201cThe Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) awarded the shoreline protection contract to Gallet Nigeria Ltd but had the contract terminated about four years later on grounds of non-execution.\n\n\u201cAfter much delay, the contract was later re-awarded in 2009 to Dredging Atlantic with nothing to show for it till today.\n\n\u201cMr. President may recall that the Ayetoro community, aside from contributing its own quota out of the 60,000 barrels of crude oil per day made by Ondo State to the nation\u2019s oil production, is also of great historical and tourism importance as the first community to have successfully practised communism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this exposure of the people of Ayetoro community and their neighbours at Mese, Gbagira, Awoye and others in the coastline to excruciating ecological disturbance due to the oil exploration, exploitation and invidious opening of canals to the Atlantic Ocean by oil companies operating within the region would not only be perceived as an infringement but a threat to lives and properties.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cIt is lamentable that projects are being repeated annually in the budget of the NDDC without reference to the Ayetoro Shoreline Protection contract.\n\n\u201cSadly, no emergency relief materials or measure has ever been provided to the victims of the sea surge, neither has any sympathetic or genuine visitation been made by the relevant agencies or their officials to Ayetoro or any of the affected neighbouring communities.\n\n\u201cAs we head towards the rainy season, the people live each day in constant and reasonable fear for the safety of their lives. If we do not act now, God forbid, we may not be able to curtail the seismic consequences to follow.\n\n\u201cWith utmost seriousness and concern, I seek your urgent and timeous intervention in the ongoing by ensuring that all hands be on deck to tackle headlong this recurring sea incursion in a manner that is holistic, inclusive and purposeful.\n\n\u201cThe situation calls for cohesion, concentration of efforts and maximum force \u2013 be it political or economic to save the people of Ayetoro and the neighbouring communities. We cannot dither anymore.\n\nNDDC, NOSDRA, others mum\n\nClaims by the people that their pleas to the federal government and its agencies have always been ignored may not be far from the truth. The attitude of different government agencies to our enquiry indicated that much.\n\nThe Niger Delta Development Commision (NDDC) ministry, the National Oil Spill Detection Agency (NOSRA) and even the Ondo State Government whose people are affected by the challenge all failed to provide answers to our enquiries.\n\nNDDC ministry spokesperson, Dr Ibitoye Abosede, did not respond to the calls and text message sent to her on allegations of failed contracts made by the people.\n\nNOSDRA spokesman, who had earlier agreed to get one of the agency\u2019s directors to speak on the alleged contribution of oil companies to the problems, subsequently failed to respond to calls from our reporter. He later asked the reporter to write a letter to the DG/CE after our reporter sent him a text message reminding him of his earlier promise.\n\nOndo State Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, said the community\u2019s problem was being handled by the office of the deputy governor and promised to send the details of the contact person. He never did even in spite of a reminder to that effect.\n\nHow Lagos fought ocean surge\n\nAfter the state suffered a similar challenge as the embattled Ondo community, Lagos devised ways to put a stop to the menace. The state government earmarked N36 billion for the construction of 18 groynes (sea breakers) to check the ocean surge between Goshen Estate and Alpha Beach.\n\nThe then Commissioner for Waterfront Infrastructure Development, Mr. Adebowale Akinsanya, said the contract was awarded in November 2012 and divided into three phases because of funding.\n\nAkinsanya explained that phase 1 of the project, which is the construction of three groynes, started in January, 2013 and had been completed, adding that phase 2, the construction of 12 groynes, was awarded in June 2013 while work began in January 2014.\n\n\u201cThe reclamation of phase 1, measuring approximately 150 hectares has been completed and a road alignment has also been reclaimed which makes it accessible by driving from Freedom Way. The Project, upon completion, will not only add to the existing stock of land mass but add to the ground rent and other taxes accruable to the state, which will boost internally generated revenue,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Toba Adedeji, Osogbo and Yinka Adeniran, Ibadan\n\nBegs President to forgive agitator, call off arrest order\n\nOffers to make him available for talks\n\nSays we warned him\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwo, Osun State, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, on Friday offered to intervene in the face-off between the federal authorities and Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo better known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nIgboho is currently underground after he was declared wanted penultimate Friday by the Department of State Security (DSS), 24 hours after raiding his Ibadan residence and arresting some of his aides.\n\nThe Oluwo, in a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, pleaded for forgiveness for Igboho and asked that the order for his arrest be \u2018slowed down\u2019 to enable him (Oba) bring him to Abuja for possible peace talks.\n\nHe was confident that Igboho would drop his agitation for the creation of a Yoruba nation.\n\n\u201cHe has pledged his readiness to listen to us,\u201d the Oluwo said.\n\nHe added: \u201cI promise your Excellency that Igboho will mind his steps henceforth. He has suffered a lot. He would step down agitations. I will bring him for a peace talk at an appropriate time.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cI extend my cool, warmest royal greetings to the number one citizen, President Muhammed Buhari. I have the hope your day is as the same as mine. As a Muslim, you are not unaware of the peculiarity of Friday, being one of the days for forgiveness.\n\n\u201cNigerians, most especially ardent readers and witnesses of history, will not forget in haste many suspicious circumstances that consumed many nationalists. One of the leading and still fresh was the Egba born aristocrat, Moshood Kasimawo Olawale Abiola, who died on July 7th, 1998.\n\n\u201cKen Saro Wiwa equally had his taste. Almost all regions of the Nigerian state have had their taste of such occurrence. The prologue and epilogue were historically preserved to be a lesson.\n\n\u201cBut when a child is a slow learner, the parents will have to guide, guard and educate several times before a stable momentum. Silence of the parents at times may be translated to support but not necessarily.\n\n\u201cNot all children appreciate their parents at the point of moral discipline. Disciplinarians tell the truth to positively shape the children\u2019s future. But when the child tells you your mouth is smelling, you stay back and observe.\n\n\u201cHowever, a responsible father will not throw his child away with the bathwater. I say this to let your Excellency understand the position of most Royal Fathers and stakeholders on agitation for the Yoruba nation. We warned him.\n\n\u201cHowever, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, earned his popularity as an activist whose joy is to liberate the cheated. He started as such and grew with it. His strategy is not known to me because I\u2019m not in his camp. Whenever I\u2019ve information about his move, I do call him to order.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe visited my palace sometime in 2018. I give pieces of advice when sought. Instead of Igboho to distinctively differentiate between agitation towards government and inter groups activism, he failed. At a point, he abused stakeholders with spurious allegations. I was the first on the list for drumming support for one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a father, I\u2019ve personally forgiven him. And I\u2019m personally beseeching your Excellency as the number one citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to demonstrate your magnanimity by forgiving our promising son, Chief Adeyemo Sunday Igboho.\u201d\n\nThe monarch also stated that Igboho is a learner in handling issues pertaining to government, but added that he is a gift to the Yoruba people.\n\n\u201cHe is a novice in handling issues against the government. He is a gift to us in Yoruba. He has pledged his readiness to listen to us. I appeal to your Excellency to slow down security trail on Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cI have the assurance adhering to this piece will go a long way in strengthening the unity of Nigeria. I promise your Excellency that Igboho will mind his steps henceforth. He has suffered a lot. He would step down agitations. I will bring him for a peace talk at an appropriate time.\n\n\u201cLiberal struggles are won on intelligentsia merit. Arsenals without strategy is a defeated battle. These and many more, I supposed he has learnt and ready to mend his way. Nigeria is an indivisible entity that cannot be torn overnight for whatever reason. Let\u2019s forgive to move on and up. The strength is not only in diversity but also in forgiveness.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we have seen the handwriting. When the government speaks different languages, the wise ruminates and take caution. I commend your efforts geared towards combating crimes, checkmating banditry and curtailing criminalities and your vigorous fight against corruption. Most importantly, your commitment to infrastructural growth is unequalled. One Nigeria, great future.\u201d\n\nThe DSS had said in a statement on the joint security raid of Igboho\u2019s residence that two of his men were killed and 13 arrested during the early morning raid.\n\nThe agency said arms, ammunition, charms, among other items, were recovered from the house after almost one hour of gunfire exchange between security operatives and Igboho\u2019s guards.\n\nIt said the raid followed an intelligence report on stockpiling of arms in the house.\n\nIt said when security operatives approached the house, they came under heavy gunfire from nine of Igboho\u2019s men. The statement said six of the men were armed with AK-47 while the remaining three had pump action rifles.\n\nHowever, Igboho, in a petition to the federal government last Saturday, protested damage to his residence, cars and other property by state agents.\n\nHe estimated his losses at N500 million and demanded same as reparation.\n\nIgboho, in a letter through his counsel Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN) also sought a public apology for what he called violation of his fundamental rights during the invasion of his house and the institution of a probe of the action of the security officials that conducted the raid.\n\nHe also implored all the governors of Southwest states that \u201cknow the yearnings of their people and Igboho\u2019s large followership to wade in before it becomes hydra headed security problems in all their domains.\u201d\n\nCounsel alleged that those arrested in Igboho\u2019s house were being tortured to incriminate him that guns and ammunition were recovered from his house.\n\nHe said: \u201cSunday Igboho knew that he would be arrested one day, hence retaining our services. He could not be that daft to keep incriminating articles in his house!\n\n\u201cOur client\u2019s house is a 5-bedroom duplex with 5 chalets of 2 and 3 bedrooms. These were totally damaged with operatives allegedly arguing on whether to burn down the edifice as done to his former palatial house. The lady officer allegedly put her foot down against arson.\u201d\n\nEfforts made to reach Sunday Igboho\u2019s media aide, Olayomi Koiki, last night were unsuccessful as calls made to his international line did not go through.\n\nThe moves also made to get his reaction through WhatsApp yielded no result.",

          "title": "How I met and married TB Joshua, by wife, Evelyn",
          "text": "By Chika Abanobi\n\nOn Monday, July 5, 2021, she led the candlelight procession to begin the one-week programme leading to the burial of her late husband, Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, Founder and General Overseer of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Lagos. He died suddenly in the early hours of Sunday, June 5, 2021 from a yet-to-be-publicly-disclosed ailment.\n\nOther events include tribute service held on Tuesday, July 6, and Wednesday, July 7, in which dignitaries, acquaintances, associates, ministers of God from across the globe, members of his congregation, beneficiaries of his philanthropy and the public gave moving testimonies concerning the noble life that he lived. In 2011, the man was estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth US$10-15 million. The tribute service was followed by service of songs/all-night praise, and lying-in-state, on Thursday, July, 8. The ceremony will be rounded off tomorrow with a thanksgiving service\n\nBut throughout the pre-burial programmes, Evelyn, TB Joshua\u2019s wife of 31-years marriage, exhibited extraordinary stoicism as she took everything in her strides. But as dignitaries gathered, on the day of service of tributes to pay compliments to her husband on the life of worthy legacy that the Nigerian charismatic pastor, prophet, philanthropist, and televangelist who mesmerized his world with prophecies and miracles of healing and deliverance, lived, she could not help but betray emotion as she talked about their marriage. Suddenly, her seemingly stoic mien gave way to a tear-choked voice halfway through her short testimony.\n\nMe, other women and TB\n\nIt brought back memories of the story that she told this reporter and Shola Oshunkeye, then editor of the defunct The Spectator, our sister newspaper at the time, of how she met and married her world-renowned sweetheart. Her husband is a man that every woman would want to have as husband she said, at the start of the interview.\n\nAsked if her statement presupposed that she was in a serious contest or battle with other women over him, she retorted, amid laughter: \u201cNot at all. I know that every woman will desire to have him as a husband but there are no struggles on my part to keep him. I know that when a man is hardworking and God-fearing, every woman will like to have him. But believe me, I fight no special battles to keep him.\u201d\n\nWhen the interviewers wondered how she was able to cope with his busy schedule, knowing fully well that women need their husbands, she answered that she didn\u2019t have any difficulties handling that aspect of their relationship because \u201cGod has so made it that we complement each other perfectly well in very many ways.\u201d With this answer, she launched into the story of how they met and married. The marriage is blessed with three children. Her story:\n\nMy first visit to TB\u2019s house\n\n\u201cIt was around 1989. I visited a sister somewhere at Ikotun Egbe Lagos, where the headquarters of the Synagogue Church of All Nations is located at present. And, they were talking about a particular man, a prophet to be precise. It was a kind of a meeting. And, it\u2019s like everybody in that gathering, or at least half of the people in the room, had actually visited him. So, they were saying a lot of good things about him. This one said he prayed for him and things became okay from there. Another said her life was a bend but straightened up when she met him. You know, things like that. I was thrilled. At the end of the whole thing, I called the sister outside and asked whether she could take me to the prophet. I didn\u2019t ask to go there out of curiosity. I actually needed a guide at that point in time.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t at any crossroads, but I desperately needed a guide. I had seen pastors. I worshipped in a church and I had read about prophets in the Bible, though I had not come across any. But at that particular time, I needed a guide, sort of and he fitted the bill snugly. Then I used to worship with the Assemblies of God Church. But back to my story, the sister and I scheduled a date. We got to his place but he was not around. Not to the Synagogue, but his house down in Ikotun Egbe, at Agodo. Unfortunately, we did not meet him at home. But looking back now, I thank God that we didn\u2019t meet him that day because that would have been the end of the story. It would have been because of what he told me the very first day that I set eyes on him. If the sister were there, I would have believed that maybe she had gone behind me to tell him all about me. And, that would have ruined it.\n\nSecond visit and TB\u2019s strange, shocking proposal\n\n\u201cSome months later, I eventually met him when I visited him. That was in 1990. I could remember that day was a public holiday. I remember also that I nearly lost my way because I had never been to the place before except that day I went with the sister. But this time around I went alone. But before I was able to locate the place, it was a bit difficult. When I got into the waiting room, I met two men waiting to see him. Before this time, the idea that I had about the Prophet was that of an old man with white, long beards, and things like that. So, on that day, I was reading a novel that I came with, I don\u2019t remember the title now, when I suddenly saw someone come into the sitting room, pick one or two things and went back. But the shadow of whatever I saw was not that of an old man.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t greet him. I didn\u2019t even look at his face. But when he left, I overheard one of the two men telling the other one, \u2018that\u2019s him; that\u2019s him.\u2019 I looked up but he was gone. They went into the consulting room before I did. Finally, it came to my turn, and I went in there. We sat opposite each other. And, he was gazing at me. He did that for about a minute and some seconds. I gazed at him, too. Transfixed as I was, I noticed that there was a piece of paper before him. Still looking at me, he wrote on it a Yoruba word \u201cEjide\u201d (translated, it means twin has come). Lest I forget, I\u2019m a twin.\n\n\u201cFor about a minute or so, we sat looking at each other until he wrote my name on that piece of paper. And, then we started talking. He told me a lot of things about myself, the ones I know and the ones I didn\u2019t know. I was shocked. He told me about my family, about my past, my present, and my future. After your secondary school education at that time, you could get a job in a factory or whatever, hoping to be staffed one day. So, after my secondary school education, life was like, today you are in business, tomorrow, you are in a printing press, and so on. I think the last place I worked before I met him was at Nigerian Distilleries in Ota, Ogun State. I was born into a family of seven. We are the fifth in the family, my twin brother and I. But he is late. I was born to the late Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Akabude in the quiet town of Okala Okpuno in Oshimili North Local Government of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI started my primary education at St. Emecheta Primary School, Ezi Town, also in Delta State. Years later, I came to Lagos. That was in 1977 and completed my primary education at Orile Primary School, Oshodi, and, my secondary school at Grammar School, Oshodi. He told me all that. Altogether, we spent about 45 minutes. At the end of the whole thing, he spoke to me in Yoruba and said: \u201cJoo ma binu o. Ma ro pe bi mo se nba gbogbo eniyan ti o ba wa s\u2019odo mi soro ni eleyi o. Mi o ni ale, mi o dee fee ni ale. Sugbon, se oo fe mi? (Please, don\u2019t be annoyed. Don\u2019t think that this is how I talk to everyone that comes to me. I don\u2019t have a concubine, and I don\u2019t want to have a concubine. But can you marry me?).\n\n\u201cIt was strange, but that gives us an insight into what the Scripture says that the Spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God\u2019s children, as written in Romans 8:16. When I woke up that morning, I never knew. But something in me said: \u2018Go to the Prophet.\u2019 And, when he proposed to me, it was strange. I don\u2019t think I have said yes up till now (laughter) but then, my heart agreed with it instantly. I think that was it. That was how I met him.\n\nHis qualities that won my heart\n\n\u201cSome months later, I asked him why he thought it was right seeing a lady for the first time and going on to propose to her. He said he has seen me four days before that very day. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t know whether it was through dream or revelation. But at that time a lot of things were going on in my mind concerning him. In the first place, I was expecting to see an elderly man. But I was shocked to see a dashing handsome young man. Like I told you, he wrote my name on the piece of paper before him. That was the first thing that really shocked me. And, the fact that he proposed to me the first time that we met without waiting to know some things about me.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, like him then, I didn\u2019t have friends. As I told you, it was a sister that I visited who took me there in the first place. So, there is no how anybody could have gone to tell him about me. And, when I was going there the second time, she wasn\u2019t there. I went alone. I have told you how I got to know about him. I told you, too, that I didn\u2019t go there out of curiosity. I needed some guidance which I believe I could get from the prophet. That\u2019s why I went.\n\n\u201cYou know, life is all about challenges. As a young lady, I knew that God was there. I have a Creator and I know He can guide me into the right path. So, I wouldn\u2019t say business or marriage or whatever drove me to him. I just needed someone to guide me on the right path. I saw an honest and humble man.\n\nI saw a God-fearing man, too. I saw a kind-hearted man, a man of one purpose; a man with a sole aim: to please God at all times, with every other thing being secondary. I think those qualities are what cemented our relationship. I am not sure we courted for long.\n\nThe wedding took place the same year, 1990. A few years later, my husband sent me to Ghana and I was able to take some management courses there.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Deadly trap: How evangelist, others slaughtered building contractor",
          "text": "By Chioma Okezie-Okeh\n\nSometime in April 2020, a building contractor known as Engineer Godwin Christopher received a call from a supposed priest requesting the contractor\u2019s services to construct a big church auditorium in Lafia Nassarawa State.\n\nOn April 16, Engineer Godwin, in company of the supposed priest who was taking him for site inspection, walked into the trap of hired assassins. They descended on the contractor and promptly slaughtered him.\n\nThe suspected assassins who were later arrested by operatives of Force Special Tactical Squad (STS) claimed that they were contracted to kill him and retrieve his SIM card by his friend identified as Sylvester Agwale, a Christian missionary.\n\nSaturday Sun learnt from police sources that the deceased\u2019s family alerted the operatives when they realised that their brother, who told them of the site inspection with the priest, was suddenly incommunicado.\n\nThey were able to track down the supposed priest, Samuel Aloko who turned out to be one of the assassins. He led the police to arrest Micah Adeka and Sylvester Agwale. The two later confessed to the police that they participated in the act while two others remain at large.\n\nEngineer was stingy\n\nOn why he ordered the execution of the deceased, SylvesterAgwale, the mastermind told Saturday Sun that all he was focused on was how to get his hands on the millions in the account of the late engineer whom he referred to as a friend.\n\n\u201cI am 29 years old and a native of Lafia in Nassarawa State. I am a member of Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) in Nassarawa and one of the dedicated persons in the missionary department. It was during one of our work that I met Engineer Godwin.\n\n\u201cHe is a contractor and has many sites where he is building houses. I started working as his assistant and we became so close that he can send me to buy building materials worth millions of naira without fear that I could run away with the money.\n\n\u201cThe only problem was that he is not generous to me. I was preparing for my wedding and he knew about it. I begged him for sponsorship, instead of giving me good money he only gave me N50, 000 donation. He then gave me a loan of N450, 000.\n\n\u201cI was not happy and decided to call my friends to get money from him. I observed that there was always so much money in his car. I had seen him bring as much as N1million from the car.\n\n\u201cI called my people and we met at a hotel in Nassarawa where we agreed that they should rob him and collect the SIM card. I told them that if the man dared to resist them, they should kill him. To further convince them, I called the engineer and asked him to send money to my account and he sent N30, 000. I told them that I overheard him talking about N25 million that was recently paid into his account for one of the jobs that he was doing.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that Samuel would be the one to woo him. He pretended that he was a pastor and wanted to build a church. In fact, on the day of the meeting, Samuel called him and gave him an appointment to come and see the site so that they could agree on an estimate. I also gave four of the boys who were at the meeting N50, 000 each as advance fees. I got the money from the allowance that the church paid me for my missionary work. I had hoped that since we were expecting millions, that all would be well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to create an alibi for himself, Agwale went to the site where the deceased was supervising his project and offered to assist him as usual. \u201cI was there when he left. He told me that he wanted to check up on a project. I knew that it was Samuel that called him. I waited behind and alerted them that he was on the move.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later, they called me that the man was dead and that nothing was found in his car. I still don\u2019t believe that story; I am sure they collected the money and hid it from me. Samuel brought the SIM card to me and I took it to meet my friend who is an expert.\n\n\u201cWe generated a new password but unfortunately before we could withdraw money from the account, it had been blocked. It was then that I knew that there was trouble. I warned everyone to go underground, but unfortunately, they were careless and Micah was arrested. He was the one who led the police to pick me.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry for allowing greed to lead me to this kind of horrible sin. I only ask God to have mercy on my soul because I know that I will be killed.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Micah claimed that when he and others were contacted, the message was to kill the engineer. \u201cWe knew from the beginning that the engineer must die. \u201cSometime in April, Samuel called me and two others that there was a job for us and N25 million was involved. It was my friend Agwale that brought the job. If the job was successful, we would all get at least N5million each. I requested that we should meet with Agwale to be sure that it was not a trap. We met at a hotel where he confirmed the job. He told us to kill the man and collect the SIM card.\n\n\u201cHe told us that someone is on standby to withdraw the money and offered the four of us N50, 000 advance payments. On April 16, which was the date of the incident, Samuel dressed up like a priest and went to an agreed spot to pick the engineer. He had told the man that they were going to inspect a land that will be used to build a big church. We took him to a site called Project in Lafia. It is a new site where people are buying land so much. As soon as he got to the agreed point, we attacked him. One of us gave him a cut on the neck while I stabbed him severally on the stomach till he died.\n\nSamuel took his phone and we searched his car. Unfortunately, only N50 was found. I don\u2019t know if Samuel took the money while we were busy killing the man.\n\n\u201cAs we were going, we broke the glass of the car so that people would think that he was robbed and killed by robbers. We were waiting for Agwale to keep to his own side of the deal when I got information that Samuel had been arrested by the police. I ran to Latan area and stayed there. I was called to supply bags of beans to a buyer and when I went there I discovered that the buyers were policemen from STS.\u201d\n\nOn how he became a cold-hearted criminal, Micah said he was lured into crime by friends. \u201cI am 26 and I\u2019m married with two kids. After my secondary education, I joined my parents and became a rice, yam and beans farmer. I did well and was able to raise money that I used to get married at the age of 22.\n\nUnfortunately, along the line, I made friends with some young herders in our area. They have big guns and they taught me how to make fast money through kidnapping and cattle rustling. I made a lot of money and it was during some of our operations that I met Samuel and Agwale. Agwale is aware that we are criminals and he has brought several jobs for us and he was given his share from the proceeds,\u201d he alleged. While insisting that he did not find any money in the car of the deceased, Samuel said that he played his role as a priest and convinced the deceased to follow him. \u201cI called him as agreed and quoted parts of the Bible to him to convince him that I am a priest. \u201cHe was so happy when we met and I was carrying a big Bible. I told him that the church is planning to spend at least N100 million on the project and he was explaining how he would get it done at a much cheaper rate.\n\n\u201cI even prayed for him in the car while we were driving to the agreed spot. As soon as he stepped down from the car and I was pointing at the land, the others attacked.\n\n\u201cI am sorry that I allowed the devil to use me to deceive him in the name of God. I am not a pastor and I rarely go to church. It was Agwale that told us that the man was a religious man and would easily be fooled if we used that strategy. I am sorry and I pray for mercy.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa and Vera Wisdom-Bassey\n\nThe remains of the late Prophet TB Joshua, Founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), were laid to rest yesterday at his church in Ikotun-Egbe area of Lagos. He died in Lagos on June 5. It was an event that attracted several eminent personalities from Nigeria as well as other dignitaries from across the globe. People in their numbers started trooping into the church from early in the morning. Security personnel, church\u2019s guards and ushers had a hectic time controlling the crowd. At exactly 10am, the casket bearing the corpse was rolled into the church\u2019s large auditorium by the undertakers. There were cries of agony in and outside the auditorium.\n\nThe bereaved wife, Evelyn, their three daughters and other members of the family ushered in the corpse to the middle of the church. Ondo State Government House Choir gave a soul-lifting rendition. Tee Mac Omatshola, the flutist, also rendered a song to wish the man of God goodbye. International gospel singer, Byron Cage, also performed.\n\nI benefited financially from him \u2013 Gov Akeredolu\n\nExtolling his virtue, Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), said Nigeria has lost a rare gem and special breed. He said the prophet contributed greatly to the emancipation of the less-privileged in Ondo, Nigeria and beyond.\n\nHe said TB Joshua was a special creature right from childhood, and started performing miracles even as a young man while in school.\n\nThe governor said that the man of God led a fulfilled life that impacted all, irrespective of race or tribal and religious affiliations. \u201cThe world is more represented here than when Nelson Mandela was buried. This shows that he was a global citizen.\n\n\u201cHis love was not only for the less-privileged but he also did good for the privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen I was just elected as a governor, he came to my house and gave me good money. He also gave me more money to be delivered to my wife, which I delivered to her. \u201cHe also paid electricity bills for four local government areas in Ondo State. He bought transformers for many communities in our state. Many of us sought deliverance from him and we got our deliverance. \u201cSynagogue Church is one of the most important tourist centres in Nigeria. Everyone benefits from the church in one way or the other. \u201cHis legacy is worthy of emulation. He has engraved his legacy in the hearts of people all over the world. Indeed, the world is mourning. We can never forget his humanitarian gestures.\n\n\u201cBy all standard, TB Joshua led a Christ-like life. Let us all imbibe his exemplary life. He preached love and was a man of peace. \u201cHe was focused despite his criticisms and misgivings by some people. Who are you to decide who to follow Jesus?\u201d\n\nHe was a General, God\u2019s servant -Sanwo-Olu\n\nAlso paying tribute to the man of God, Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, described the prophet as a General in God\u2019s House. He said that TB Joshua\u2019s life was worthy of emulation. He added that the cleric\u2019s story was an inspirational one that cannot be forgotten in a hurry. He said that the prophet never forgot his roots, even after he became a renowned leader and global evangelist.\n\nSanwo-Olu, whose speech was delivered by the state commissioner for Home Affairs and Culture, Prince Olanrewaju Elegushi, said TB Joshua played the role of a father to many orphans and led a life of dedication, love and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cHe helped many people to fulfill destinies that God has given them. His life should encourage us to renew our hope in Christ. Prophet TB Joshua\u2019s charitable gifts and love for humanity should open our eyes to the possibility of a world where we all live in peace despite our racial, religious and cultural differences,\u201d the governor said.\n\nYouths, street urchins besiege church entrance\n\nAt the entrance of the church, it was a herculean task for the security operatives as they battled to prevent many youths from forcefully gaining entrance into the premises. The youths, many of them street urchins, sang different songs, reflecting how the late prophet loved them and never despised them.\n\nDisplaying the deceased portrait, the angry youths claimed that they were bonafide members of Ikotun-Egbe community that must not be edged out in the scheme of things. The security personnel, at some point, had to apply some force to keep the angry youths from pulling down the iron barricade that served as checkpoint for those allowed to cover the event.\n\n\u201cWe are here to wish him goodbye but we are treated like criminals by these security people. The man was not like this,\u201d one of the protesting youths said.\n\nBusiness booms\n\nMany people were seen making brisk business outside the premises of the Synagogue. While many of his followers were mourning the demise of their prophet, others were smiling to the bank, having tapped into the crowd that besieged the church to pay the deceased his last respects. The stretch of the median of Ikotun Egbe Street, where the church is located, was decorated with assorted materials engraved with the prophet\u2019s picture. There were, calendars, hats of different sizes, identity cards, T-shirts, wrist bands, fez caps, and key holders in large quantities. Joining others to extol the legacy of the SCOAN founder, the wife of the Ooni of Ife, Olori Naomi Ogunwusi Adeyeye, said Prophet TB Joshua was a gift to humanity who sacrificed all he had for others to be happy.\n\nShe described the late prophet as a true son of the soil who blessed so many people. She prayed for the wife, children, other relatives, and the church. Other dignitaries at the event include the deputy governor of Ondo State, Lucky Orimisan, Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly, Bamidele Oleyelogun, Lagos State Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Stephen Adegbite, representative of CAN\u2019s President, David Lyon, who was former governor-elect in Bayelsa State, Chairman of Egbe-Idimu Local Council Development Area, Kunle Sanyaolu and other persons and groups from different continents.\n\nAt 2.24pm, the body was taken from the church auditorium to his the tomb that was prepared for it, also within the church\u2019s premises. At that moment, the quite sobs metamorphosed into uncontrollable wailing. As the weeping pervaded the air, the casket was lowered to the ground at about 2.53pm. Bishop Steven Ogedengbe, Roberto Acosta from Argentina and other men of God within and outside Nigeria charged the congregation on the need to continue to celebrate TB Joshua, saying that the late prophet had fulfilled his own assignment on earth.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle hails from the Local government.\n\nThe affected communities are Tsauni, Gudan-Baushi, Gidan-Adamu, Wari and Gudan-Maidawa.\n\nAn indigene of the area, Malam Buba Faru, said the bandits, who rode over 100 motorcycles, stormed the communities located few kilometres on the eastern part of Faru town.\n\nBuba said the bandits shot indiscriminately at the people and burnt their houses and food stores.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting sporadically at people they came across in the five communities. They also attacked farmers who were in their farmlands cultivating their crops. So far, 42 dead bodies have been recovered by the security and volunteer groups in the area.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of the village, Ahmed Lawali, also confirmed the deadly invasion to THISDAY yesterday in a telephone interview, and said the bandits, numbering up to 70, stormed the village at about 4.30pm when most of the victims were working on their farmers.\n\nHe explained that the marauding bandits who were on reprisal mission to the village, trailed the farmers to their respective farms and started shooting sporadically, \u201cin the process, 39 persons mainly men, were massacred on the spot.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bandits raided the village following the arrest and killing of two of their members along Mafara- Faru road by the group of vigilantes popularly known as Yan\u2019sakai who nabbed them with two AK-47 riffles last Wednesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday (Thursday) at about 4:30pm bandits armed with sophisticated weapons attacked Faru Village when some of us were still working on our farms. They (bandits) killed 39 people on their farms and injured many others.\n\n\u201cThey (bandits) attacked the village because last Wednesday, Yan\u2019sakai arrested and killed two bandits along Mafara- Faru road who were nabbed with two AK-47 riffles. It was a reprisal mission.\n\n\u201dWe buried all the dead bodies this morning (Friday) according to Islamic rights after Friday prayer. We are calling on security agencies to come to our rescue so that we can return to our farms because farming is our main occupation here (in Faru).\u201d\n\nHowever, the Zamfara State Police Public Relations Officer SP. Muhammad Shehu, while confirming the incident, said 35 people lost their lives as a result of the attack by the bandits in the village.\n\nHe added that, a joint security task force comprising military, police, NSCDC had been deployed to the area \u201cand normalcy has been restored right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, their corpses were taken to Faru town where they were buried.\n\nShehu stated that the police could not reach the affected communities on time when they were informed of the bandits\u2019 attack due to the road network.\n\n\u201cThe police personnel tried their best to reach the affected communities on receiving the information that the bandits were there but unfortunately they could not reach the places because of the bad roads,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the \u201cpolice are currently working tirelessly\u201d to arrest the bandits\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi and Deji Elumoye\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday said the President Muhammadu Buhari administration plans to rely on a common-sense strategy to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a time frame of 10 years.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural meeting of the National Steering Committee on Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Prof. Osinbajo said the government would adopt a different and more effective approach in actualising the objective of eradicating poverty in the country for the sake of delivering results.\n\nA statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Office of the Vice President, Mr. Laolu Akande, quoted Prof Osinbajo as saying, \u201cI want us to approach this as much as possible, common-sensical so that we can resolve all the issues and focus on the real progress.\n\n\u201cI want us to look beyond all of what we are going to be doing, there is going to be a considerable amount of paperwork, but a lot of common sense is what grows economies. It\u2019s what other countries have done, not reinventing the wheel. So, I want us to focus on those common-sensical things so that we can move forward.\u201d\n\nExpressing the hope that this way, the Committee will be able to achieve rapid progress, Prof. Osinbajo said, \u201cin order not to make this merely, another of those high-sounding committees that eventually achieve nothing, we have to be very intentional about our objectives and how to achieve them.\u201d\n\nCiting the example of Bangladesh where a poverty reduction strategy was also implemented, the Vice-President noted how the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was key.\n\n\u201cBangladesh exports more garments than we export oil,\u201d the VP said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccountries that have managed to get out of poverty have created a lot of jobs through industries, and they have developed intentional strategies.\n\n\u201cWe must look at what others have done, the smart things that other people have done, and adopt. We have to think smartly about how we are funding agriculture,\n\n\u201cI think we really need to take a deep dive because governments have made several efforts at poverty alleviation but generally speaking, they have not yielded the sort of results they should yield, and I think it\u2019s because there is a lot of focus on documentation and paperwork and very little common-sense approaches,\u201d the VP added.\n\nOsinbajo explained that the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy is meant to be a national strategy, not just a federal effort and it is aimed at taking 100 million people, nationally, out of poverty within a target time-frame of 10 years.\n\nHe said, \u201cI just want to emphasise that it is a national strategy as opposed to a federal strategy which is why the steering committee is made up of federal, as well as state officials.\u201d\n\nWhile also emphasising the role of the private sector, the VP said, \u201cEssentially, this effort must also be directed at how to facilitate private sector creation of jobs. The fact is that there is no way that the federal government or the state governments can create the number of jobs that we need.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a few broad looks at the features of what constitutes our present predicaments in terms of job losses and unemployment.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said efforts will be made to focus attention on creating opportunities for Nigerians to earn decent livelihoods in addition to equipping them with the necessary vocational skills.\n\nAlso in attendance at the meeting were Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, who is also Nigeria Governors Forum Chairman, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, and Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State.\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha; Ministers of Agriculture, Muhammad Nanono; Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, and Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige also attended, while the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba joined the meeting virtually.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Oba of Benin, Obaseki Set for Showdown over Looted Artefacts",
          "text": "*FG demands unconditional repatriation from Germany\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nExcept a compromise is reached, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, are heading for a showdown over the impending return by Germany and the United Kingdom of artefacts stolen from the Benin Palace in 1897 during a raid by the colonial invaders.\n\nWhile the monarch favours the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or in the alternative, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the palace believes the governor prefers a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nHowever, Obaseki told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\n\nHe said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nNotwithstanding, the brewing quarrel in Benin may become public knowledge today as Oba Ewuare II addresses a historic press conference, the first ever, signposting the importance he attaches to the issue.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the brewing crisis may replay the bitter aspect of the history of ancient Benin Kingdom dating back to 1897 when Britain invaded the kingdom, subdued Oba Ovonramwen, plundered and looted his palace and sent him on exile.\n\nA Benin chief named Obaseki, said to be the great-grandfather of the current governor, was apprehended by palace historians as one of those who betrayed Oba Ovonramwen and made the British expedition a success.\n\n\u201cThe current standoff, therefore, has a touch of history,\u201d a Benin chief told THISDAY last night, pointing out: \u201cIt is significant that another Obaseki is at play on this occasion.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the imminence of the return of the looted artefacts by the UK, German and French governments, Obaseki came up with a grand plan to form a private trust, not owned by the state government, to take custody of the returning artefacts.\n\nHis plan, it is gathered, is to have the private trust build a museum of West African Arts in Benin, the state capital, where the artefacts would be kept and curated.\n\nLegacy Restoration Trust, a private entity, THISDAY learnt, has since emerged, parading itself as the authorised custodian of the artefacts.\n\nOba Ewuare II is said to have opposed this move on the ground that it would amount to private appropriation of the cultural heritage of his kingdom.\n\nWhile the monarch is said not to be opposed to the idea of the federal and state governments taking custody of the artefacts and keeping it in a museum to be built by them, he has expressed his objection to a private trust managing the ancient artworks.\n\n\u201cOba Ewuare\u2019s position,\u201d said a source, \u201cis that at the least the artefacts should return to the palace where they were stolen, contending that the palace could on its own build a museum where they would be kept and manage.\u201d\n\nThis position was well articulated in a statement by Benin Traditional Council dated 10th May 2021 and signed by the Secretary, Mr. Frank Irabor; and the Executive Assistant, Corporate and Legal Affairs, Mr. Denis Osaretin.\n\nDisowning Legacy Restoration Trust and Legacy and Legal Restoration Trust that it said had been parading themselves as presumptive custodians of the incoming artefacts, it said: \u201cFor categorical clarification, these individuals and groups of persons are not known nor authorised by the Oba of Benin, who is the original owner of the looted artefacts and the custodian of Benin customs and tradition.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpololokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, Oba of Benin remains the custodia Legis of all insignia, symbols and such other artefacts depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Benin people.\u201d\n\nIt said, the Oba of Benin or his duly authorised representative or body corporate, is, therefore, the only person that can have any dealings with any foreign donours or missions or any international institution over the artefacts.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that following this statement, the Secretary to the State Government had conversations with the palace secretary but the meeting ended in a deadlock with both parties hugging their mutually exclusive positions.\n\nAt the centre of the conflict, THISDAY has learnt, is the potentially huge financial resources that might accrue from the warehousing of the artefacts.\n\nAlready, the German government is committed to an initial donation of 4.5 million Euros to the Edo Museum of West African Arts and Cultural District projected to be built in Benin City.\n\nThis was revealed in a statement on Wednesday by Foreign Minister Maas, which spoke eloquently about the desire of Germany to return the artefacts in its custody and pay adequate reparation.\n\nObaseki too had spoken glowingly about his trust project last month after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, during which he sought the federal government\u2019s help to secure the return of the artworks.\n\nObaseki said museums had become catalysts in the evolution and development of cities.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThere is a city called Bilbao in Spain, and that was the head of the Basque separatist movements many years ago.\n\n\u201cThe investment by the Guggenheim Foundation, by the Guggenheim family museum in Bilbao, has changed the economic fortunes of that city.\n\n\u201cToday, Bilbao earns more than a billion dollars from just the presence of that museum in that city. Because everybody wants to come in to see what\u2019s in that museum.\n\n\u201cSo, bringing back these works, this world cherished works, bringing the originals back to their home, I mean, you can imagine for years to come, people, children unborn, all over the world want to come and see these pieces.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration was designing a whole cultural district for Benin, saying that the proposed museum would be situated within the cultural district.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs I speak, the planners from Latin America are in Benin City, looking at work and doing the surveys. That process should end in about August.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the museum is going to be a series of, you know, buildings, you have the pavilion where these works will be brought in initially and will be kept.\n\n\u201cWe also undertaking more archaeological excavations, and whatever we find will be kept in the pavilion.\n\n\u201cWe have a national museum that currently exists. And that\u2019s going to be refurbished, then we have the main Edo Museum of West African Arts. And the construction for that will take another one or two years to begin.\u201d\n\nOba Ewuare is, however, resisting the private trust, being promoted and led by Phillip Ihenacho, said to be Obaseki\u2019s business partner in Afrinvest, with Victor Ehikhamenor, Enotie Ogbebor, Eric Idiahi and Babatunde Adebiyi as trustees with renowned Ghanaian architect, David Adjaye as architectural consultant.\n\nTHISDAY learnt the monarch had reached out to the presidency and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, who appear to be sympathetic to the cause of having the looted artefacts returned to the palace from where they were stolen.\n\nFG Demands Unconditional Repatriation from Germany\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has urged Germany to ensure an unconditional return of the 1,130 Benin artefacts that were looted from Nigeria in the 19th century and domiciled in German museums.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, at meetings, held on Wednesday in Berlin with German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Monika Grutters, and Foreign Minister, Mr. Heiko Maas, said the return should be whole rather than substantial on the heel of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u201csubstantial return\u201d of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nHe added that the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the artworks.\n\n\u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin),\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, the minister reiterated that no conditions should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the artefacts, in addition to concluding all negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe said the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the artworks were not the end of an era but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy, between both countries.\n\nHe thanked Germany for taking the lead\n\nin the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts looted from Nigeria and the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead,\u201d he said Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum was being built-in Benin City to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nHe said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the federal government, the (Benin) royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nOn his part, the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar, said the issue of the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes should be seen as an opportunity to take the cooperation between Nigeria and Germany to a greater height.\n\nHe commended Germany for taking the lead in the repatriation process.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, had said: \u201cThe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the Nigerian delegation that the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from next year.\n\nShe stated that the fact that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, adding that all the museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani, and Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare, who was invited by the German government.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace-turned-museum in the heart of Berlin that houses art works from around the world.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

If you don't stop fighting the Akwa Ibom state government, Governor Udom Emmanuel and Deputy Governor Pa Moses Ekpo, we will kill your entire family while you are in prison and your friend, Godswill Akpabio, will not do anything.\n\n\"We transferred you from Ikot Ekpene prison to Uyo prison for you to suffer and your friend, Godswill Akpabio, could not help you.\"\n\nSee Also Politics Akwa Ibom Governor Recalls Varsity Student Expelled For Insulting Him On Facebook\n\nUmoh, after that, narrated his ordeal for months in the hands of the police.\n\nHe said, \"I came to Nigeria from America in the first week of December 2020 towards my wedding that took place on December 19, 2020, at CKC Barracks Road. After my wedding on December 19, I was invited by the police on December 22 that there was a petition against me by the state government.\n\n\"I was told that I supported the EndSARS protest by inciting the youths and making a video in Dallas, Texas, back in October 2020. I was held at the police cell from 22 to December 24, 2020, and was released on bail.\n\n\"On December 28, 2020, the police called me to come back to the station with a promise that the Deputy Governor who wrote the petition against me wanted to squash the case and allow me to be, so I went to the station again while on bail and was arrested again and taken to court where they obtained a court order to remand me in prison custody.\n\n\"My charges were \"Threat to Life and Conspiracy,\" although there was no case to show that I conspired with someone. I spent a month and a half in custody with \"Threat to Life and Conspiracy\" charges.\n\n\"After a month and a half, I was about to be given bail but the police came and dropped the \"Threat to life/Conspiracy\" charges and my bail application was revoked immediately, which kept me in jail for almost two months before I was granted a bail with a new charge of \"terrorism\" which means that I was held in prison for over a month with two wrong charges of \"threat to life and conspiracy.\"\n\n\"I was released from prison and now facing the trial with the state government, while the Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State as the petitioner has not for once appeared at the court.\n\n\"The trial was scheduled for the first week of June 2020 and appeared at the court but the trial was now shifted to 27th, 28th and 29th July and we all know that this is just a delay tactic from Akwa Ibom State to keep me here in Nigeria away from my wife and kids.\n\n\"I am a US citizen by birth but I am being held hostage in Akwa Ibom State by the Akwa Ibom State Government. They have no right to hold a US passport which is a US government property but they are holding it just because they feel that they are above the law.\n\n\" Someone at the US Consulate in Nigeria by the name Kevin reached out to Akwa Ibom State Attorney General when I was in prison with two wrong charges of \"Threat to Life and Conspiracy,\" and he took time and explained to the US Consulate why I was given those charges and he assured him that those were the right charges although they couldn't provide or mentioned someone that I conspired with.\"\n\nUmoh noted that the state government had refused to explain to the US Consulate and US Government why he was imprisoned for more than a month on two false charges.\n\n\"My gold necklace and my gold bracelet were taken from me by the police officers on December 24, 2020, and till today, they say they can't find those items, and they have refused to tender them to me.\n\n\"A threat letter was also pasted on my gate while I was in prison and since then, I have been hiding from one place to another because my house is not safe,\" Umoh added.",

          "text": "The Federal Inland Reve\u00adnue Service (FIRS) says it sealed the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) corporate headquarters in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, on Thursday over tax debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuhammed Nami, FIRS chairman, said this in an interview with NTA on Friday.\n\nAlthough, Nami did not state the specific amount, he said NDDC owes an \u201coutstanding tax of N26 billion\u201d.\n\nThis is not the first time the tax agency is carrying out the act. In 2018, the Rivers Inland Revenue Service (RIRS) sealed off the NDDC headquarters in the state due to withholding tax estimated at over N600 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a year, the same was done over unpaid withholding tax to the tune of N50 billion.\n\nIn April 2021, the FIRS directed all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to remit all outstanding tax liabilities to the service within 60 days.\n\nIt said failure to do will lead to the deduction of unremitted taxes from the budgetary allocation of the defaulting MDAs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNami said: \u201cTax debt is a priority all over the world. We\u2019ve sent a signal to ministries, departments and agencies of government that business is not going to be usual in this country.\n\n\u201cYou cannot keep government money and force the government, whether at local, state and federal level, to continue to borrow\u2026because these monies (taxes) are used by the government to fund their budgetary requirement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed (FIRS and NDDC), even with some cabinet members, and we\u2019ve reached an agreement which will be made known to Nigerians between now (Friday) and Monday.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ibitoye Abosede, NDDC director of corporate affairs, said the development was due to a gap in communication between NDDC and the new management of FIRS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is an ongoing thing. In 2018, this same happened. It is unremitted withholding tax for some years up to 2013. It is not a recent thing,\u201d Abosede said.\n\n\u201cWe have done reconciliation and they came with that amount.

In 2018, the Rivers Inland Revenue Service (RIRS) sealed off the NDDC headquarters in the state due to withholding tax estimated at over N600 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a year, the same was done over unpaid withholding tax to the tune of N50 billion.\n\nIn April 2021, the FIRS directed all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to remit all outstanding tax liabilities to the service within 60 days.\n\nIt said failure to do will lead to the deduction of unremitted taxes from the budgetary allocation of the defaulting MDAs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNami said: \u201cTax debt is a priority all over the world.

          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, increased the popularity of mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The shortage in talent began compounding into increased workload and mounting pressure for remaining IT employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect the source\u2019s identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Existing investors like Khosla Impact, ValueStream Ventures, Beta.Ventures, 500 Startups, and Story Ventures participated. New VCs like LocalGlobe, Intercept Ventures, and Future Africa also took part in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, Smile Identity has raised $11 million from investors with this latest funding round. In 2019, it raised $4 million in seed funding.\n\nWhat does Smile Identity do? Founded by Mark Straub and Willliam Bares in 2017, Smile Identity provides identity verification and KYC compliance tools to help African banks, telecom companies, financial service providers, and ride-sharing businesses better engage their customers.\n\nExpansion so far? Following the co-founders\u2019 arrival in Africa, the business has made key strides in its activities, such as the establishment of a local presence in six African countries: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, the company claims to connect to over 15 different identity authorities, while its ID validation covers over 250 million identities on the continent.\n\nThe new investment will allow the company to offer even better services and grow in new markets. It will also support more ID types and hire more engineers and staff on the continent.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nSafaricom increases the cost of airtime\n\nKenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has accepted the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s additional taxes proposal.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recent call for new taxes on airtime and data service prices. Finally, the bill has been passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of recent changes to the taxation of telephone and Internet data services, Safaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s top telecom companies, has adjusted the pricing of its products and services.\n\nWhat does this mean for Safaricom\u2019s subscribers? Calls made between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. will now cost Sh4.87 per minute, while calls made between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. will only cost Sh2.50 per minute.\n\nThe cost of Safaricom home fibre for the lowest package will rise to Sh2,999 from Sh2,900, while the silver package increases to Sh4,100 from Sh3,999.\n\nThe gold and diamond packages \u2014 up from Sh5,699 and Sh11,499 \u2014 will now cost Sh6,299 and Sh12,499, respectively.\n\nAdditional fees were also introduced for roaming and international calls. The cost to send a single short message is now Sh1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of browsing via airtime (without bundles) will increase at a similar rate to voice calls.\n\nSimilar? Mobile network operators, including Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya, have also adjusted their calling charges. The two telecom companies have raised the rate of calls to Sh2.78 per minute. Also, the price of Telkom Kenya\u2019s SMS message has increased to Sh1.15.\n\nMarketForce raises $2 million pre-Series A round\n\nFeatured Image Credit: TechCrunch\n\nAnother funding? Yes. Kenyan B2B retail platform, MarketForce, has raised $2 million pre-Series A to focus on its business-to-business (B2B) retail marketplace, RajeRaje.\n\nWho participated in the round? P1 Ventures, Y Combinator, Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and other unnamed investors.\n\nBefore now, the retail distribution platform raised $350,000 in seed round and a $150,000 cheque from Y Combinator as part of the accelerator\u2019s Summer 2020 batch. This round brings the funds raised by the company to $2.5 million.\n\nThe retail distribution platform got into Y Combinator accelerator\u2019s Summer batch 2020, and upon graduation, they decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRajeRaje is a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants and was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nWith RejaReja, it\u2019s interesting to see MarketForce joining other supply chain revamp startups like TradeDepot and Sokowatch to fix Africa\u2019s unorganised retail supply chains.\n\nRejaReja has more than 15,000 retail customers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania who use the platform to process thousands of orders daily.\n\nExpansion plans? It\u2019s planning on expanding to Nigeria with the new funds and expanding its product across East Africa.\n\nIncredibly, the founders \u2014 Tesh Mbaabu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Mesongo Sibuti, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) \u2014 are computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nNigeria to block MultiChoice Nigeria and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts\n\nDStv dish.

Yesterday, Thursday, July 8, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) announced that it had directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA) in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nWhy did it happen? Abdullahi Ahmad, the Director of Communications and Liaison Department, said the company has continuously violated all contracts and agreements with the tax agency.\n\nBesides, MultiChoice allegedly denied the FIRS access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMuhammed Nami, Executive Chairman, FIRS, said that the companies have failed to provide relevant and timely responses to correspondences, and their records are not accurate and accessible.\n\nSo, the banks that handle business for MultiChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria were instructed to perform a balanced search on their accounts before undertaking any other transaction on their behalf.\n\nNonetheless, MultiChoice believes that the case is based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d because they were not formally notified on the matter. Also, they said they had not given authorities full access to their subscribers\u2019 information.\n\nMultichoice told Reuters that they had previously engaged in an open, transparent, and constructive dialogue with FIRS, and they hoped that issue could be resolved amicably.\n\nSimilar? In 2018, MTN Nigeria Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes on imports and other payments from 2007 to 2017. However, the demand was later withdrawn.\n\nIf this controversy isn\u2019t resolved soon, it could have an adverse effect on DStv\u2019s operations in Nigeria.

They did not promptly respond to correspondences and lacked data integrity and transparency. It also added that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferring to the group\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary, the tax authority said MCN \u201chas avoided giving FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mohammed Nami, Executive Chairman FIRS, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nHowever, per TechCabal, MultiChoice\u2019s results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nAccording to Reuters, MultiChoice Group makes a third of its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. From the company\u2019s annual report, Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment.\n\nInterestingly, at the close of business yesterday, MultiChoice stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were down 7.38% from the previous day. The fall reached levels that have not been seen since October 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax to GDP ratio has steadily declined between 2001 to 2020, reaching a record low of 6.1% in July 2020\n\nWith such an abysmal tax to GDP ratio \u2014 one of the lowest in the world \u2014 the country has tried to increase its tax base. In 2017, it introduced the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), from which the government claimed to have raised \u20a670 billion\n\nIn 2019, it also increased its Value Added Tax from 5% to 7.5%, generating \u20a61.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiChoice becomes the second South African company to face a crackdown from Nigerian authorities. MTN has been the subject of several penalties, the most recent which occurred in 2018 involved a $2 billion tax bill for payments to foreign suppliers. The bill was later withdrawn.\n\nIn an official reply, MCN said it had not received any notification from FIRS yet. It has however indicated that it is willing to engage the tax authority transparently and constructively. It also said its operations in Nigeria are continuing.\n\nThe company says it has been and is currently discussing with FIRS regarding their concerns and believes they can resolve the matter amicably.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these words will ring true in the coming days.",

He said this in the wake of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u2018substantial return\u2019 of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nMohammed said the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the art works, noting, \u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes, which is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin).\u201d\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, Mohammed also reiterated that no condition should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the Benin Bronzes in addition to concluding all necessary negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe added that the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the artworks was not the end of an era, but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy between both countries.\n\nThe Minister thanked Germany for taking the lead in the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts that were looted from Nigeria and the African continent, adding \u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead.\u201d\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation, said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum is to be built in Benin City, to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nThe governor said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the Federal Government of Nigeria, the (Benin) Royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, said \u201cthe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from the beginning of 2022, noting that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation. She said such a move indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, saying all the Museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar and Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace turned museum in the heart of Berlin that houses artworks from around the world.\n\n...",

It could only resuscitate two years later, after a payment dispute involving farmers.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to process enough quantity of tomato to make our operations successful,\u201d Managing Director Abdulkarim Kaita was quoted as saying. \u201cAt the moment, we are counting losses.\u201d\n\nTomato farming provides jobs to around 200,000 persons in Nigeria, and lenders largely do not see giving loans to farmers as bankable even though the government is giving domestic production priority.\n\nSuch policy slips, deep-seated graft and ethnic conflict are keeping investors away, worsening the labour crisis in an economy that has one of the worst unemployment rates in the world.\n\nThe Dangote factory intends to help Nigeria slash 300,000 tonnes of tomato paste imports from China. Yet 900,000 tonnes of tomato are lost each year to absence of enough storage and processing facilities.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that our production demand has not been met so far and we need to increase the volume of supply from the farmers,\u201d Mr Kaita said.\n\nA majority of the farmers live far away in the villages, making it hard for vehicles to convey tomatoes to the factory.",

          "text": "Golden Agri Inputs Ltd. a subsidiary under the Agro-Allied Division of Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) has launched a Maize and Soybean Value Chain Development Programme for farmers called YALWA (Abundance) in Kaduna State.\n\nThe \u201cYALWA\u201d program established to aggressively double maize and soybean output in Nigeria through greater yields and volume, improved quality, and competitive pricing, is hinged on a well-defined Backward Integration strategy of FMN that is implemented through the use of strategic partnerships, input loans, agricultural extension, agronomy training, farm-gate participation, and out-grower schemes.\n\nWith the formal signing ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Kaduna State government recently, the program which has a national outlook, is set to commence implementation from the state.\n\nOther focus states captured in the programme include Niger, Gombe, and Kwara. Impact is projected to reach over 25,000 farmers and touch 100,000 individuals through farmer household empowerment and job creation over the next 5 years.\n\nThe drivers of the programme disclosed that Kaduna was picked as the starting point for having evolved into the northern hub of enterprise for agri-centric innovation, with strong crop output for the most reliable crops, especially maize.\n\nLead farmers in the state were each presented with input loans, 8 bags Pioneer hybrid seed corn, 60 bags of 50kg 20:10:10 NPK Golden Fertilizer 40 bags of Urea and 2 bags of 25kg Soybean seed and requisite chemicals to kick start the initiative.\n\nSpeaking at the MoU signing, Falade Olusegun Isaac, General Manager, Golden Agri Inputs said: \u201cWe are happy to officially kick start the YALWA project, and particularly delighted to partner with the good people of Kaduna State. In line with our purpose of feeding the nation, every day, FMN is committed to creating linkages between agriculture and industry, while also enhancing the food system in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cInitiatives such as YALWA will surely influence the development of raw materials availability in the country, enhance food security, and alleviate the strain of FOREX. To achieve this, we will be working closely with farmers via well-structured and well-defined out-grower schemes, assisting them by providing improved inputs as loans, providing good agronomic support, extension services, and ultimately off-take of their harvest \u2013 thus providing a ready market at a competitive price.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe program\u2019s lead, Mr. Olushola Fashedemi, Head of Commercial, Golden Agri Input, highlighted the importance of collaborating with Corteva Agricscience, which is one of the world\u2019s best performing hybrid seed companies and the owner of some of agriculture\u2019s most famous brands, such as Pioneer.\n\n\u201cThis is of course in addition to Golden Penny Fertilizer, which is widely recognized as one of the top fertilizers in the country. Essentially, our goal with the YALWA program is to improve farmers\u2019 livelihoods, and as such, we will be monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on our efforts in conjunction with the CBN and several other state governments,\u201d he said.\n\nFashedemi also commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its invaluable role in ensuring that the program at the national level kicks off with no issues.\n\nHe added that the focus on market linkage, access to market and financial inclusion was topmost in the CBN intervention.\n\n\u201cMore importantly CBN has partnered on this program to ensure a stable and steady supply of raw materials to the factories.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are currently working with 1,000 farmers in 10 LGAs across the state, with the goal of doubling yield potential in these focus value chains by the end of the program. We envisage that maize will increase from 2.5mt to 5mt per hectare and soybean from 1mt to 2mt per hectare, all while optimizing local content for our feeds and protein downstream investments,\u201d he added.\n\nHonorable Hajiya Halima Lawal, Kaduna State Commissioner for Agriculture, commended the Project YALWA initiative and urged farmers to take advantage of the opportunity it avails them.",

          "title": "As TB Joshua Is Buried, Intrigues That Shaped Pastor\u2019s Last Crusade In Nazareth",
          "text": "Tears flowed in torrents amidst tributes yesterday at the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, as the remains of its late founder, Prophet T.B. Joshua, were buried in the church premises.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend reports that his remains were interred in the headquarters of Synagogue Church of All Nations located at Ikotun-Egbe area of Lagos at exactly 2:40pm.\n\nAs earlier announced by the church, the burial ceremony was performed privately by members of his family including his widow, Evelyn Joshua, his children, loved ones and senior members of the church. The renowned clergyman, who was born on June 12, 1963, died on June 5, 2021.\n\nOndo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, said during the internment ceremony that the late Prophet was not buried in his hometown in Ondo State because he was a world citizen.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu explained that the late televangelist was from Ondo State and a Nigerian but his activities while alive made him a world citizen that cannot be claimed by any particular jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the governor, he was contacted by the monarch of Arigidi Akoko, the hometown of TB Joshua, Oba Yisa Olanipekun, to convince the family and the church to bring the remains to the hometown as the final resting place.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen the Zaki of Arigidi-Akoko called me, he was crying on phone, he begged me to talk to the family. I told him there was nothing I could do because the man of God has a family and his final resting place can only be decided by them, \u201cYes, he was from us, from Ondo State, he was a Nigerian but he remained a world citizen,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the late prophet as a rare gem, adding that the renowned man of God was a blessing to humanity and a great Ambassador of the Sunshine State whose Ministry was noted for charity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGovernor Akeredolu while harping on the good deeds of the late Prophet TB Joshua said his philanthropic gestures when he was alive were unequalled.\n\nHis Last Crusade In Nazareth\n\nMeanwhile in Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, in the northern district of Israel is a city steeped in history. Every landscape-the hills, the valleys, the fields, the wells, the water, the ancient buildings are all landmarks that captures an aspect of this rugged ancient city\u2019s rich history. The city is metaphor of Christianity.\n\nThe ancient city is used to visits of historical figures due to its significance to Christianity, but probably of recent, no individual\u2019s visit had attracted so much passion and reactions like the late Prophet T.B. Joshua\u2019s in June 2019.\n\nThe visit was tagged \u2018Nazareth Meeting with T.B. Joshua\u2019. For a man who was used to attracting extreme emotive reactions from people, the 2019 Nazareth crusade was no different. It was tagged \u2018meeting\u2019 because the Israeli\u2019s government was trying to avoid offending the sensibilities of the Orthodox Judaism religion adherents who are in the majority in Israel.\n\nWhen this reporter arrived at Nazareth few days to the event, from Ramada Olivie Hotel in Nazareth Illit, he could feel a tensed atmosphere. This was not helped by a frenzy of media stories both in the local newspapers and online in which the late cleric was labeled with different names. Further still, the undercurrent of the local politics of Nazareth between the Mayor, Ali Salam, and his opponents did not help matter. His political opponents accused him of bringing a shaman to Nazareth; some Christian religious groups in Nazareth were also lukewarm towards the meeting, although some equally decided to partner with him for the crusade.\n\nHowever, Mayor Salam insisted the meeting had economic values to the city as the Nigerian prophet was going to attract thousands of tourists, bringing in the much needed business.\n\nThe Israeli government was a little apprehensive about the meeting but had no reason to stop it as Prophet Joshua had followed all the laws and guidelines they had places before him to fulfill.\n\nHowever, a few days to the event which was to start on June 23, Nazareth came to life. Thousands of people from about 50 countries had arrived the city taking up almost all the hotels. Hundreds of luxury buses filled with religious tourists were being ferried from the Ben Gurion International Airport, to Nazareth. The hotels in Nazareth and other nearby towns were having off-season boon. It was obvious that the decision to bring the Nigerian cleric, from business perspective, was a wise one, but the city was still sitting on edge, not knowing what to expect at the crusade ground. It could all dissolve into violence and protests. The city was sitting on edge.\n\nThe last Christian clergy to hold such a programme on Mount Precipice in Nazareth was Pope John Paul 11 on Saturday, March 25, 2000. But the late Roman Catholic Pope was not dogged by controversy like T.B. Joshua. All attention was on Mount Precipice which was close to the entrance to the city of Nazareth.\n\nFrom Mount Precipice, located outside the southern edge, the ancient city of Nazareth spreads out like a painting on canvas. At night, the picturesque view transforms into thousands of tiny shiny light like stars in the sky. Mountain Precipice, other mountains and hills of Nazareth have made history and have also seen history being made. It was here, on Mount Precipice, according to the Bible, an irate mob attempted to throw Jesus Christ down the cliff.\n\nOn Sunday, June 23, 2019, the ancient town of Nazareth, with majority Muslim population, was agog as people from more than 50 countries of the world stormed the birth place of Jesus for the Christian religious programme.\n\nMore than 50 luxury and sprinter buses were put to use, conveying people to and fro the mountain. Tens of police personnel and private security providers were also on hand to ensure there was no breakdown of order. Vehicles were parked kilometres away from Mount Precipice, while every visit assessed the mountain using the bus shuttle. Due to well organized logistics, there was no breach whatsoever.\n\nAlthough it was a 4pm to 8pm programme, as early as 11 am, many were already at the entrance of amphitheatre at the mountain top waiting for the gate to open.\n\nThe Mount Precipice amphitheatre, built and donated to Nazareth by Prophet TB Joshua and his Emmanuel TV partners, has a capacity of 40,000. It was filled with equally thousands sitting on the plastic chairs provided at the overflow.\n\nProphet TB Joshua\u2019s message was titled: We Are Known By Our Love. He urged the congregation to love one another irrespective of religion or race and that love comes from God.\n\nHis words: \u201cGod measures our love for Him and for our neigbour. Any one who does not love his fellow man cannot love God whom he has not seen. This is His command: whoever loves God must also love his fellow man.\n\n\u201cHow do you access love, by the practical things in our lives? We assess our love for God by the number of times we lovingly think of Him daily, by the degree of hunger we have to read His word. The more we love Him, the more precious His word will become.\u201d\n\nThe climax of each day\u2019s programme was the prayer line where thousands of people from different continents with different diseases were prayed upon.\n\nThe stories and testimonies from the crusade on Mount Precipice quickly spread into the town. Some had watched the crusade through EmmanuelTV and on the net.\n\nThe well organized programme with very tight security and excellent crowd management also saw many natives of Nazareth among the crowd. The natives and tourists trooping to the town to see the birth place of Jesus, were confessing seeing the manifestation of the power in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nOne of the natives at the event, Roger Wakim, a Christian Arab and a member of the Mother Church of the Holy Spirit in Nazareth Illit summed up the experience. \u201cThis is the experience when Jesus was on earth in Israel. He was sent to start ministering at the age of 30. For three and half years he was casting out demons and healing the sick. Deliverance and healing go side by side. Whenever there is deliverance, there will healing.\u201d\n\nOnce of those who testified receiving their healing was Pastor Gregory Englert, an Indian based missionary. He said: \u201cI was hit by a car. From then on, I started to have headache; my neck would go out of place and my back would go out of place, things like that. I started treating the ailment, but the treatments only give me temporary relief. It would periodically come back. It would leave and then come back. So, that was the problem. I also had some breathing problem, allergies and so on. It was glorious to come here.\u201d\n\nAsked why he decided to travel to Israel, he said: \u201cI have read testimonies; I have equally seen people that go to Prophet T. Joshua crusades. They get the results that they\u2019ve been looking for, or they will get the answers and reasons for certain things in their lives and the solutions. Whatever the problem, it will come to a grinding halt. So, I wanted to come here. I have attended many prayer conferences without getting the solution, but if there was any chance, I would have gone to Lagos, Nigeria because thousands go weekly in and out. I had to get a letter of invitation. So, this opportunity came. Just a week ago, I was there in the United Kingdom and I told God I would love to attend this event. And he made this a reality.\u201d\n\nThe Mayor of Nazareth, Mr. Ali Salam, said the visit and meeting of Prophet T.B. Joshua supports the city economically. His words: \u201cThis visit supports the city economically and some defeated politicians in the recent electoral battle, who are trying in vain for relevance, are now working to impede my work on peace. In order to support their weak position, they claim I receive and praise those who claim prophecy.\n\n\u201cIf you want to fight for peace, fight with funds not lies and fabrications. The people of the city will not fall into the trap you are trying to build. They love the mayor who works day and night to raise the city economically, culturally, ethnically and educationally.\u201d\n\nThroughout the two-day meeting on Mount Precipice, there was no protest, no security breach and no accident. The mountain has made history, and has also watched history being made. It was on this mountain, the Bible recorded, that mob attempted to throw Jesus Christ from the cliff.\n\nAfter the first day of the crusade, many indigenes of Nazareth, once the see black Africans would beckon to them calling \u2018TB Joshua!, TB Joshua!!\u2019 It became a name most Africans, including this writer, had to bear until departure from the city.",

          "text": "Tears flowed in torrents amidst tributes yesterday at the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, as the remains of its late founder, Prophet T.B. Joshua, were buried in the church premises.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend reports that his remains were interred in the headquarters of Synagogue Church of All Nations located at Ikotun-Egbe area of Lagos at exactly 2:40pm.\n\nAs earlier announced by the church, the burial ceremony was performed privately by members of his family including his widow, Evelyn Joshua, his children, loved ones and senior members of the church. The renowned clergyman, who was born on June 12, 1963, died on June 5, 2021.\n\nOndo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, said during the internment ceremony that the late Prophet was not buried in his hometown in Ondo State because he was a world citizen.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu explained that the late televangelist was from Ondo State and a Nigerian but his activities while alive made him a world citizen that cannot be claimed by any particular jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the governor, he was contacted by the monarch of Arigidi Akoko, the hometown of TB Joshua, Oba Yisa Olanipekun, to convince the family and the church to bring the remains to the hometown as the final resting place.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen the Zaki of Arigidi-Akoko called me, he was crying on phone, he begged me to talk to the family. I told him there was nothing I could do because the man of God has a family and his final resting place can only be decided by them, \u201cYes, he was from us, from Ondo State, he was a Nigerian but he remained a world citizen,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the late prophet as a rare gem, adding that the renowned man of God was a blessing to humanity and a great Ambassador of the Sunshine State whose Ministry was noted for charity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGovernor Akeredolu while harping on the good deeds of the late Prophet TB Joshua said his philanthropic gestures when he was alive were unequalled.\n\nHis Last Crusade In Nazareth\n\nMeanwhile in Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, in the northern district of Israel is a city steeped in history. Every landscape-the hills, the valleys, the fields, the wells, the water, the ancient buildings are all landmarks that captures an aspect of this rugged ancient city\u2019s rich history. The city is metaphor of Christianity.\n\nThe ancient city is used to visits of historical figures due to its significance to Christianity, but probably of recent, no individual\u2019s visit had attracted so much passion and reactions like the late Prophet T.B. Joshua\u2019s in June 2019.\n\nThe visit was tagged \u2018Nazareth Meeting with T.B. Joshua\u2019. For a man who was used to attracting extreme emotive reactions from people, the 2019 Nazareth crusade was no different. It was tagged \u2018meeting\u2019 because the Israeli\u2019s government was trying to avoid offending the sensibilities of the Orthodox Judaism religion adherents who are in the majority in Israel.\n\nWhen this reporter arrived at Nazareth few days to the event, from Ramada Olivie Hotel in Nazareth Illit, he could feel a tensed atmosphere. This was not helped by a frenzy of media stories both in the local newspapers and online in which the late cleric was labeled with different names. Further still, the undercurrent of the local politics of Nazareth between the Mayor, Ali Salam, and his opponents did not help matter. His political opponents accused him of bringing a shaman to Nazareth; some Christian religious groups in Nazareth were also lukewarm towards the meeting, although some equally decided to partner with him for the crusade.\n\nHowever, Mayor Salam insisted the meeting had economic values to the city as the Nigerian prophet was going to attract thousands of tourists, bringing in the much needed business.\n\nThe Israeli government was a little apprehensive about the meeting but had no reason to stop it as Prophet Joshua had followed all the laws and guidelines they had places before him to fulfill.\n\nHowever, a few days to the event which was to start on June 23, Nazareth came to life. Thousands of people from about 50 countries had arrived the city taking up almost all the hotels. Hundreds of luxury buses filled with religious tourists were being ferried from the Ben Gurion International Airport, to Nazareth. The hotels in Nazareth and other nearby towns were having off-season boon. It was obvious that the decision to bring the Nigerian cleric, from business perspective, was a wise one, but the city was still sitting on edge, not knowing what to expect at the crusade ground. It could all dissolve into violence and protests. The city was sitting on edge.\n\nThe last Christian clergy to hold such a programme on Mount Precipice in Nazareth was Pope John Paul 11 on Saturday, March 25, 2000. But the late Roman Catholic Pope was not dogged by controversy like T.B. Joshua.

          "title": "Kaduna kidnap: Baptist Church calls for emergency prayer in over 100 countries",
          "text": "Following the abduction of 121 students of Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State, the Nigerian Baptist Convention said it had started organising prayers in all Baptist churches in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nThe President, Nigerian Baptist Convention, Revd Israel Akanji, said this in an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Friday, which he said was the last day of the Baptist World Alliance.\n\nAkanji said the alliance comprised 127 countries of the world and that the event held via Zoom, a virtual meeting platform.\n\nThe clergy said at the event hosted by Brazil, the 127 countries that make up the Baptist World Alliance were informed of the abduction of students of the Bethel Baptist High School.\n\nAsked what efforts the Baptist Church had made so far, the clergy said, \u201cYou know that we are a church and once we are in any difficulty, the first point of call is to God in prayer. Therefore, we have been organising prayer all over the Baptist Church in Nigeria and all over the world.\n\n\u201cIn terms of publicity (of the abduction), all over Nigeria, it is known. Every state is aware and the Baptist World Alliance is also aware.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Elijah Brown, the General Secretary of the Baptist World Alliance, has made a kind of press statement in which he spoke about the abduction of the students in Nigeria. He condemned this act that has been going on in Nigeria and especially the kidnapping of the students of our Baptist High School.\u201d\n\nDespite the attack, Akanji said the Baptist Church would not be intimidated, noting that the Church would continue to provide quality education. According to him, the Baptist Church has for the past 166 years operated secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cOne thing we have been letting everybody know is that the Baptist denomination has given education to Nigeria since 1855. For 166 years now, the Nigerian Baptist Convention has been providing education.\n\n\u201cOur first institution is the Baptist Academy in Lagos, which is still an institution to reckon with today and has produced great men and women for Nigeria. And the Baptist Boys High School in Abeokuta, Ogun State, produced Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Chief MKO Abiola. These are people who greatly impacted Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNow, in our history, this is the first time in 166 years that a Baptist school would be raided and the students kidnapped. It had never happened. So we believe in the strength of our history. By calling the Almighty God, our students shall be returned to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we are thinking that having called on God and on our track record as a denomination providing education for this nation without ceasing for 166 years, we deserve that our students should be brought back,\u201d he added.\n\nAkanji said he had spoken with the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, who he said promised to do everything possible to secure the students\u2019 release.\n\nAsked if the Baptist Church would engage Islamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi in leading mediation talks with the bandits to free the kidnapped students, Akanji said the church would not stop parents from seeking Gumi\u2019s help.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the issue of talking to Sheikh Gumi, well, you know that when people are desperate, when people are in trouble because you are talking of a school where 121 students cannot be accounted for\u2026 These 121 students have parents and family members who are very concerned.\n\n\u201cIn fact, some parents slept in the school compound, praying all night that the children should be back. The parents can do what they like.

          "text": "Following the abduction of 121 students of Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State, the Nigerian Baptist Convention said it had started organising prayers in all Baptist churches in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nThe President, Nigerian Baptist Convention, Revd Israel Akanji, said this in an interview with Saturday PUNCH on Friday, which he said was the last day of the Baptist World Alliance.\n\nAkanji said the alliance comprised 127 countries of the world and that the event held via Zoom, a virtual meeting platform.\n\nThe clergy said at the event hosted by Brazil, the 127 countries that make up the Baptist World Alliance were informed of the abduction of students of the Bethel Baptist High School.\n\nAsked what efforts the Baptist Church had made so far, the clergy said, \u201cYou know that we are a church and once we are in any difficulty, the first point of call is to God in prayer. Therefore, we have been organising prayer all over the Baptist Church in Nigeria and all over the world.\n\n\u201cIn terms of publicity (of the abduction), all over Nigeria, it is known. Every state is aware and the Baptist World Alliance is also aware.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Elijah Brown, the General Secretary of the Baptist World Alliance, has made a kind of press statement in which he spoke about the abduction of the students in Nigeria. He condemned this act that has been going on in Nigeria and especially the kidnapping of the students of our Baptist High School.\u201d\n\nDespite the attack, Akanji said the Baptist Church would not be intimidated, noting that the Church would continue to provide quality education. According to him, the Baptist Church has for the past 166 years operated secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cOne thing we have been letting everybody know is that the Baptist denomination has given education to Nigeria since 1855. For 166 years now, the Nigerian Baptist Convention has been providing education.\n\n\u201cOur first institution is the Baptist Academy in Lagos, which is still an institution to reckon with today and has produced great men and women for Nigeria. And the Baptist Boys High School in Abeokuta, Ogun State, produced Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Chief MKO Abiola. These are people who greatly impacted Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNow, in our history, this is the first time in 166 years that a Baptist school would be raided and the students kidnapped. It had never happened. So we believe in the strength of our history. By calling the Almighty God, our students shall be returned to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we are thinking that having called on God and on our track record as a denomination providing education for this nation without ceasing for 166 years, we deserve that our students should be brought back,\u201d he added.\n\nAkanji said he had spoken with the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, who he said promised to do everything possible to secure the students\u2019 release.\n\nAsked if the Baptist Church would engage Islamic cleric Sheikh Ahmad Gumi in leading mediation talks with the bandits to free the kidnapped students, Akanji said the church would not stop parents from seeking Gumi\u2019s help.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the issue of talking to Sheikh Gumi, well, you know that when people are desperate, when people are in trouble because you are talking of a school where 121 students cannot be accounted for\u2026 These 121 students have parents and family members who are very concerned.\n\n\u201cIn fact, some parents slept in the school compound, praying all night that the children should be back. The parents can do what they like. And if they have been going round looking for one kind of assistance or the other, we will not know the extent but as a church, we have only been speaking to the government and insisting that the government should bring our children back because the security of lives is in the hands of the government.\n\n\u201cI cannot stop anybody who goes to anybody to look for help because as I said, these children have parents, and we cannot stop them. They are at liberty to go wherever they want. But you are asking me as a church and I am saying that in our church, we have not taken that decision that we are going to Gumi.

ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE in this report x-ray the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and the dark clouds over the leading opposition party.\n\nGovernor of Ebonyi state Dave Umahi left the party last year; the governor of Cross River state, Ben Ayade, also defected to the APC not long ago and only last week, a PDP senator, Peter Nwaoboshi, followed the same route. On June 29, 2021, the Zamfara state governor, Bello Muhammad Matawalle, left the PDP for the APC. Also, all the 24 members of the House of Assembly as well as the three senators and six out of the seven members of the House of Representatives defected to the APC.\n\nNot long ago, the senator representing Delta North Federal Constituency, Peter Nwaoboshi, defected from the leading opposition party to the APC. In Cross River state, thousands of PDP members in Abi local government area, which is the constituency of former Governor Liyel Imoke, defected to the APC. Significantly, after dumping their umbrella for the broom, the crowd proceeded to conduct a symbolic burial of the PDP by setting ablaze a coffin draped in the party\u2019s colours.\n\nOn Wednesday, the last and only PDP member in the House, Jonathan Gaza, who represents Keffi/Karu/Kokona federal constituency of Nasarawa state, also dumped the party for the APC.\n\nAs these defections continue, especially from the opposition to the ruling party, it has brought about a sense of panic in the opposition ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nPDP\u2019s excuses\n\nIn his reaction, the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, said those who left were intimidated by the instrument of the APC-led federal government. Addressing journalists at a meeting of party leaders recently, Secondus, however, said the PDP would win the presidential election in 2023 \u201cbecause the masses are with the party.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me also emphasise that APC governors and the government of APC are overbearing on the system and moving to poach our governors and this to them is regarded as an achievement. I have never seen where you have an economic crisis, insecurity crisis, then the ruling party poaching governors.\n\n\u201cThey are going after our governors, but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote each, but we are after the people, the masses. The masses are solidly behind us; the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form this new government coming in 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame for all the governors that left the PDP for fear. They were intimi\u00addated by the instrument of this government, but I\u2019m hap\u00adpy that the masses in their states especially in Zamfara have not left.\u201d\n\nBuhari gives reasons\n\nOn his part, President Muhammadu Buhari who congratulated Governor Matawalle on his defection to the APC, governors and other politicians for joining the ruling party, saying it\u2019s \u201cbecoming more popular and because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.\u201d\n\nIn a message delivered on his behalf by the secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, at the defection ceremony in Gusau, President Buhari said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to re-build Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nA statement by his presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, further quoted the president as urging APC governors and elected lawmakers across the country \u201cto continue to work harder to ensure our party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.\u201d\n\nHe reminded all elected party officials that their \u201cperformance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party,\u201d adding that \u201cparty leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.\u201d\n\nGombe gov\u2019s take\n\nReacting, the Gombe state governor, Inuwa Yahaya, who ruled out the possibility of the country heading to a one-party system, said PDP members were moving in droves to APC \u201cbecause the ruling party is more transparent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with one of our reporters, the governor said Nigerians should expect more political parties coming up to join the existing ones as soon as they meet INEC\u2019s requirements and constitutional provisions.\n\nHe said, \u201cA party that is in control necessarily has to attract people that are ready to give their support and they are coming because they realise that APC is more solid, more on the ground and more transparent and open in terms of how it deals with everybody; the high and the low. That is why they are coming; so, we welcome them and anybody that says no should have a re-think because the party is about people and all politicians are invited and welcome to any party that they think belongs to the right track. That is what APC is.\u201d\n\nEx-Edo commissioner\u2019s view\n\nIn his view, a one-time Commissioner for Information in Edo state, Prince Kassim Afegbua, said the continuous defection of governors from PDP to APC was a testimony to the leadership \u201ctactlessness and spinelessness of the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC.\u201d\n\nAfegbua, therefore, called for the sack of Secondus, warning that the \u201cugly trend if not addressed portends doom and could lead to the collapse of the party.\u201d He, in a recent statement, said, \u201cWhen I raised the alarm two months ago about the gradual decimation of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the Uche Secondus leadership, many had thought I was raising dust over nothing.\n\n\u201cThe events of the last one month and the continuing defection of major PDP stakeholders to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is a further testimony to the leadership tactlessness and spinelessness of the Secondus-led NWC of the party.\u201d\n\nThe statement partly read \u201cIt should be of urgent concern to all stakeholders and organs of the party, including the Governors\u2019 Forum, to arrest this obvious drift which has left our dear party naked before Nigerians, home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThere is a more compelling need to urgently call for a stakeholders\u2019 meeting to mitigate, amongst other things, this obvious decimation of the PDP by a leadership that is utterly bereft of ideas, confused, intellectually hollow, phlegmatic and absentminded in the affairs of the nation and the party.\n\n\u201cAn opposition party that should be gaining momentum because of the leadership failures of the ruling APC is at best losing some of her best hands across the nation and losing the much-needed momentum.\n\n\u201cAll these defections portend bad omen for an opposition party that should gain maximum mileage under a system that has been run aground by the menacing incompetence of the APC-led federal government. On a regular basis, critical stakeholders are defecting to the APC, such bile in the dish.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s opinion\n\nA public affairs analyst, Samuel James, said with the gale of defections, the chances of the PDP to win the 2023 elections \u201care becoming slimmer.\u201d\n\nIn a phone chat with Blueprint, James said, \u201cWe all know that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is still evolving. In most cases, it is difficult for a ruling party to lose a state that it\u2019s in control of. So, the more states a party controls, the better chances they are to get to win the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAPC has more governors and more states; out of the 36 States, PDP is in control of 13 while the APC is in control of 22. It simply means that APC is already leading PDP with nine states, from where they can use their governors to make a big difference in the 2023 general elections. So, with all these, the 2023 chances of the party are becoming slimmer.\u201d\n\nPDP scribe\u2019s assurances\n\nDefiantly, the PDP deputy national publicity secretary, Diran Odeyemi, said the party was not losing sleep over the defections of its members.\n\nOdeyemi, in an interview with Blueprint Weekend, said PDP would win the 2023 elections \u201cbecause of the suffering, corruption and the level of insecurity Nigerians are experiencing under the APC administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not losing sleep. We are not, because a political party generally is like an open door and nobody closes it. People can come in and people can go. Since the election will be taking place in 2023, we believe a lot of repairs would have been done for us to win the presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win the election based on three advocacies: Number 1, virtually all Nigerians have joined PDP in opposing the government of APC. With the suffering, inflation, corruption and with insecurity, everybody has become opposed to this government. So, we believe that Nigeria can not afford to continue suffering. As a result, they are going to vote for the PDP.\n\n\u201cNumber 2, PDP as a political party is going to present a candidate whose performances would have won about 50 per cent of the votes. We are seriously working on this and as soon as we come up with our candidate, Nigerians will clap for us. Finally, we believe as a party we don\u2019t have an internal crisis that will warrant anybody defecting. So, we hope and anticipate that we will reap from their crisis very soon.\u201d\n\nAn expert\u2019s outburst\n\nStating reasons for the defection of PDP governors, a political analyst, Jide Ojo, said \u201cnemesis is catching up with the party for its 16 years of misrule.\u201d\n\nOjo, in a phone chat with our reporter, lamented that, \u201cWe are gravitating towards a one-party state. That is the irony of this whole thing, because we were hoping we are having a de facto two-party system as you have in other democracies like in the UK, where you have the conservative and the labour parties; in the US where you have the republicans and the democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen people have a desire, they will go after it. Yes, about the argument that Uche Secondus needs to go for peace to reign, there are allegations of corruption and embezzlement against him by some members. But then PDP is not new to such controversies.\n\n\u201cThe defections are a nemesis that is catching up with PDP. 16 years in the government; recall how PDP also poached the governors of the opposition to strengthen its hold on power. So, it\u2019s now being treated the way they treated other parties in the past.\u201d\n\nAny way out?\n\nOn the way out for the party to militate against consistent detections, Ojo said, \u201cIt must show beyond just parroting; it must show that it is a born again party. You know part of the problems of the PDP was the imposition of candidates as well as the lack of internal democracy. Look at what happened in their governorship primary election in Anmabra state. Also, remember the South-west zonal congress held in Osun state, it was fraught with vote-padding and other corrupt practices. One wouldn\u2019t have expected that to be happening in the PDP, especially with Secondus apologising for their 16-year misrule, pledging that they had turned a new leaf.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s left for them to do some house-keeping, pursue the rule of law, pursue pro- people policy, and let their governors, senators and representatives be seen to be different.\n\n\u201cThey need to review the party; the chances of the party to win 2023 elections are getting slimmer. They can review their activities as a party and re-build the party; they should make sure their congresses from ward to local government, state and ultimately to the national convention are credible; that will throw up credible candidates.\n\n\u201cIf they can re-build and follow rule of law, if credible candidates emerge from their primaries and they shun money politics, then the party will become attractive to politicians of note.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s view, BMO\u2019s expose\n\nAn analyst, Musa Ilallah, writing from Maitama, Abuja, noted that the recent defections of top-notch PDP members point to the fact that PDP is gradually losing its grip as a leading opposition party in the country, having failed to provide a mature, foresighted approach as a credible opposition.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) in a signed statement by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, \u201cAnd just like that exodus signposted PDP\u2019s loss at the centre in 2015, the latest one is a harbinger of what the opposition party should expect in 2023, especially as APC is evolving into a truly ideological political powerhouse built on integrity.\u201d\n\nIlallah noted further that, \u201cThe high-profile defections and other massive defections of middle and low-level PDP members to the ruling APC explains in unambiguous terms that PDP has failed as a ruling party up to May 29, 2015, and now as an opposition party.\n\n\u201cNon-performance, massive looting and inability of the PDP to deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigerians while in power, despite the enormous funds at its disposal, and lacking the capacity to be a good opposition party have further confirmed that PDP is a sinking ship.\n\n\u201cToday, there is a twist in the narration as opposition members of the PDP are moving massively into the fold of the ruling APC. We are really and truly living in interesting political times.\n\n\u201cThe greater secret about the mass exodus of PDP members to APC is largely attributable to the integrity, maturity and selflessness of the President that he has brought to bear on governance and party politics in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cAll hope is not lost for PDP to reclaim its leadership role as Africa\u2019s largest opposition party and perhaps return to power in 2023, if it sits up and does the needful. Time is certainly not on its side.\u201d",

          "text": "President Joe Biden has told President Vladimir Putin the US will take \u201cany necessary action\u201d to stop cyber-attacks from Russia, the White House says.\n\nA reporter asked Mr Biden after the hour-long phone call if Russia would face consequences, and he said: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBut Moscow denied US claims they had contacted the Russians repeatedly about the cyber-attacks in the past month.\n\nFriday\u2019s call between Mr Putin and Mr Biden follows their meeting last month in Geneva.\n\nIt also comes amid an increase in attacks, including one that disabled 1,500 companies this month.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear to him that the United States expects when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it\u2019s not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is,\u201d Mr Biden told media after the phone call.\n\nWhen a journalist asked whether the US could attack the servers used by the hackers, the Democratic president said: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBut after Friday\u2019s call, the Kremlin said the US had not contacted Moscow about the cyber-attacks.\n\n\u201cDespite readiness from the Russian side to jointly clamp down on criminal activity in the informational sphere, over the past month no requests have been received from the relevant US departments,\u201d said a statement from Mr Putin\u2019s office.\n\nAn unnamed senior US official denied Russia\u2019s claim, telling AFP news agency the Biden administration had made \u201cmultiple, specific requests for action\u201d.\n\nThe Kremlin statement added that both sides supported further co-operation on cyber-security, which Russia said \u201cmust be permanent, professional and non-politicised and should be conducted via special communication channels\u2026 and with respect to international law\u201d.\n\nA White House readout of the call states that both sides agreed to a deal that will see more humanitarian aid for Syria, signifying that the two leaders see opportunities for co-operation, despite tensions over cyberspace.\n\nRansomware attacks \u2013 where criminal syndicates hijack companies\u2019 data and demand payment for its return \u2013 have exploded in recent years.\n\nAccording to the US, many of the worst attackers come from Russia, and often operate with tacit knowledge, an even approval, from Russian security services.\n\nMr Biden said on Friday that the call came as part of a new, \u201cmore direct means of communication\u201d.\n\nThe new connection, Mr Biden said, allows each side to \u201ccommunicate to one another when each of us thinks something\u2019s happening in the other country.\n\n\u201cIt affects the home country. And so it went well. I\u2019m optimistic.\u201d\n\nThe message Mr Biden said he had delivered on Friday was similar to the message that he brought when the two leaders held their first face-to-face meeting last month in Switzerland.\n\nSince then, the Russian or Eastern European based REvil hacking group unleashed a massive attack that caused outages across the globe.\n\nThe hacking placed increased pressure on Mr Biden to do something to counter the threats.\n\nDuring Mr Biden\u2019s meeting in Geneva last month, he provided the Russians with a list of 16 sectors that must not be attacked.",

          "title": "\u2018We Need Help\u2019: Haiti\u2019s Interim Leader Requests US Troops",
          "text": "Haiti\u2019s interim government said it asked the U.S. to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare the way for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination.\n\n\u201cWe definitely need assistance and we\u2019ve asked our international partners for help,\u201d Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. \u201cWe believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.\u201d\n\nThe stunning request for U.S. military support recalled the tumult following Haiti\u2019s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation \u2014 which lasted nearly two decades \u2014 as a way to avert anarchy.\n\nBut the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to assist with the ongoing investigation into a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff.\n\nOn Friday, a group of lawmakers declared loyalty and recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti\u2019s dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government\u2019s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Mo\u00efse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government.\n\nJoseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder for political gain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in a power struggle,\u201d said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that\u2019s through elections.\u201d\n\nJoseph spoke as more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of murky, international conspiracy involving a Hollywood actor, a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy and a private security firm operating out of a cavernous warehouse in Miami.\n\nAmong those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed what they described as more than a dozen \u201cmercenaries\u201d who were former members of Colombia\u2019s military.\n\nSome of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan\u2019s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief L\u00e9on Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought.\n\nThe attack, which took place at Mo\u00efse\u2019s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. Joseph said he has spoken to the first lady but out of respect for her mourning has not inquired about the attack.\n\nColombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are heavily sought after by private security firms and mercenary armies in global conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and powerful drug cartels.\n\nIn an unexplainable twist would\u2019ve surely outed any highly sensitive mission, some of the men posted on Facebook photos of themselves visiting the presidential palace and other tourist spots in the Dominican Republic, which shares Hispaniola Island with Haiti.\n\nThe sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday \u2014 hours after Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder \u2014 when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.\n\n\u201cHe told me not to tell our mother, so she wouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears.\n\nIt\u2019s not known who masterminded the attack. And numerous questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president\u2019s residence posing as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president.\n\nCapador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti.\n\nCapador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security \u2014 a previously unknown company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants.\n\nThe wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia\u2019s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month \u2014 a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, non-commissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their retirement pensions.\n\nUribe is under investigation for his alleged role in the murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 that he tried to present as someone killed in combat, part of a spate of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia\u2019s U.S.-trained army more than a decade ago.\n\nCTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some of them since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp.\n\nCTU\u2019s website lists two addresses, one of which was a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other was a small suite under a different company\u2019s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist at the office said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother\u2019s reputation does not remain like it is,\u201d said Capador. \u201cHe was a humble, hard-working man. He had honours and decorations.\u201d\n\nBesides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans.\n\nInvestigative Judge Cl\u00e9ment No\u00ebl told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Mo\u00efse, not kill him. No\u00ebl said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday.\n\nSolages, 35, described himself as a \u201ccertified diplomatic agent,\u201d an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his home town of Jacmel, on Haiti\u2019s southern coast.\n\nHe worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His Facebook page, which was also taken down following news of his arrest, features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.\n\nCalls to the charity and Solages\u2019 associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn\u2019t have any military training and doesn\u2019t believe he was involved in the killing.\n\n\u201cI feel like my son killed my brother because I love my president and I love James Solages,\u201d Schubert Dorisme, whose wife is Solages\u2019 aunt, told WPLG in Miami.\n\nJoseph refused to finger any attackers but said that Mo\u00efse had earned numerous enemies while attacking powerful oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts.\n\nSome of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and well-known businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate president Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors early next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged.\n\nAnalysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. Even before Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder, Port-au-Prince already had been on edge due to the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.\n\nProsecutors also want to interrogate members of Mo\u00efse\u2019s security detail, including the president\u2019s security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri H\u00e9rard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.\n\n\u201cIf you are responsible for the president\u2019s security, where have you been?,\u201d Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. \u201cWhat did you do to avoid this fate for the president?\u201d",

We won\u2019t move forward if we don\u2019t have a clear date on signing and return,\u201d he told participants at the round-table. \u201dFull return should be completed in a year, not beyond August 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said Nigerians were eagerly awaiting the return of the 1,130 Benin Bronzes, which are being held by various museums in Germany.\n\nThe German government is coordinating the return of the Benin Bronzes, which are mostly held by state and private museums.

          "title": "\u2018We Won\u2019t Hand Over Our Artefacts\u2019: Oba of Benin Says No To Third Parties Using Benin Bronzes for Financial Gain",
          "text": "As the nation awaits the return of hundreds of artefacts looted from the Bini Kingdom in 1897 from Germany, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, on Friday alleged that some unscrupulous people were moving to hand over the artefacts to unauthorised private entities or third parties and that it would be resisted.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of the August 2022 deadline set by the federal government for the German government to ensure full return of hundreds of artefacts looted from the Bini Kingdom in 1897.\n\nObaseki had told THISDAY last Thursday that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\nBut Oba Ewuare II, who addressed a press conference on Friday said he had agreed with the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki to house the artefacts in a palace museum and that the controversy around it was absolutely unnecessary.\n\nHe said: \u201cI had a discussion with the governor about the need to return them to the palace. If he is here, I will ask him if that was not what we agreed upon. The international community must also know this.\n\n\u201cI will ask for prayer for the governor because it seems there are some unscrupulous people behind this arrangement, who might be doing it for financial gain.\u201d\n\nThe Oba said he discussed with the Minister of Information and Culture on the direct repatriation of the artefacts to Benin Kingdom from where they were stolen.\n\nHe added that the federal government should take custody of the artefacts and not to hand it over to a private company or the state government, until the Benin Royal Palace Museum was built.\n\nAccording to the Oba, \u201cThankfully just yesterday I spoke with the Hon. Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed who is presently in Germany over the negotiation with the German Government over the plans for the repatriation of our artefacts. He assured me that the federal government remains committed to unconditional return of our artefacts and will guarantee their full custody for their onward transmission to Benin Kingdom to the exclusion of any unauthorised private entities or third parties.\n\n\u201cWe once again thank the federal government for this commitment. It now behoves on the federal government to be the only level of government that can take custody of the artefacts with a view to transferring them to their original owner and their original place of abode, more so that there exist international treaties and laws guiding these processes.\u201d\n\nThe Oba said he also discussed the destination of the expected artefacts with Obaseki, stating that they reached an understanding that the Palace would be in charge, but that he was surprised by his recent position.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that shortly after my ascension to the throne, I had several discussions with the governor on the plan for the Benin Royal Museum and he expressed his readiness to work with the Palace to actualise this laudable wish of my father. I made efforts and acquired additional plots of land from different families within the Adesogbe area near the present day palace for this purpose.\n\n\u201cI was, however, surprised to read from the Governor\u2019s letter to the Palace where reference was being made to the fact that a new Museum to be known as EMOWAA is now being proposed, which will be funded and executed through the vehicle of another body now referred to as Legacy Restoration Trust.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Godwin Obaseki informed me in his correspondence of another implementation framework using the so-called Legacy Restoration Trust and the Edo Museum of West Africa Arts (EMOWAA), my response was that the setting up of another organisation or legal entity in whatever form or guise will not be necessary or acceptable.\n\n\u201cI informed him that Oba Ewuare II Foundation has been registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and has worked out a framework for not only receiving the artefacts but also building a modern structure \u2013 The Benin Royal Museum \u2013 within the precincts of the Palace and that land has been secured for the building of the Benin Royal Museum under the supervision of the traditional institution. But for reasons best known to him the Governor has gone against the understanding, given recent events.\n\nThe Oba, who addressed Palace Chiefs, Enigies (Dukes) on the repatriation of the looted Benin artefacts, the Benin monarch strongly advised that anyone, group, organisation, or government \u2013 national and international that is dealing with any organisation or artificial group in the process of returning the artefacts looted from the Benin Kingdom would be doing so at their own risk and against the will of the people of the Benin Kingdom.\n\nThe Oba of Benin\u2019s press conference was in reaction to a report yesterday by THISDAY that hinted at a possible showdown between him and the Edo State governor on the final destination of the looted artefacts.\n\nObaseki had told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City",
          "summary": "As the nation awaits the return of hundreds of artefacts looted from the Bini Kingdom in 1897 from Germany, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, on Friday alleged that some unscrupulous people were moving to hand over the artefacts to unauthorised private entities or third parties and that it would be resisted.\nBut Oba Ewuare II, who addressed a press conference on Friday said he had agreed with the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki to house the artefacts in a palace museum and that the controversy around it was absolutely unnecessary.\nHe said: \u201cI had a discussion with the governor about the need to return them to the palace.\nHe added that the federal government should take custody of the artefacts and not to hand it over to a private company or the state government, until the Benin Royal Palace Museum was built.\nThe Oba of Benin\u2019s press conference was in reaction to a report yesterday by THISDAY that hinted at a possible showdown between him and the Edo State governor on the final destination of the looted artefacts.",

          "text": "Bandits killed 42 farmers on Thursday evening in five communities in Faru, Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State. Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle hails from the Local government.\n\nThe affected communities are Tsauni, Gudan-Baushi, Gidan-Adamu, Wari and Gudan-Maidawa.\n\nAn indigene of the area, Malam Buba Faru, said the bandits, who rode over 100 motorcycles, stormed the communities located few kilometres on the eastern part of Faru town.\n\nBuba said the bandits shot indiscriminately at the people and burnt their houses and food stores.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting sporadically at people they came across in the five communities. They also attacked farmers who were in their farmlands cultivating their crops. So far, 42 dead bodies have been recovered by the security and volunteer groups in the area.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of the village, Ahmed Lawali, also confirmed the deadly invasion to THISDAY yesterday in a telephone interview, and said the bandits, numbering up to 70, stormed the village at about 4.30pm when most of the victims were working on their farmers.\n\nHe explained that the marauding bandits who were on reprisal mission to the village, trailed the farmers to their respective farms and started shooting sporadically, \u201cin the process, 39 persons mainly men, were massacred on the spot.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bandits raided the village following the arrest and killing of two of their members along Mafara- Faru road by the group of vigilantes popularly known as Yan\u2019sakai who nabbed them with two AK-47 riffles last Wednesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday (Thursday) at about 4:30pm bandits armed with sophisticated weapons attacked Faru Village when some of us were still working on our farms. They (bandits) killed 39 people on their farms and injured many others.\n\n\u201cThey (bandits) attacked the village because last Wednesday, Yan\u2019sakai arrested and killed two bandits along Mafara- Faru road who were nabbed with two AK-47 riffles. It was a reprisal mission.\n\n\u201dWe buried all the dead bodies this morning (Friday) according to Islamic rights after Friday prayer. We are calling on security agencies to come to our rescue so that we can return to our farms because farming is our main occupation here (in Faru).\u201d\n\nHowever, the Zamfara State Police Public Relations Officer SP. Muhammad Shehu, while confirming the incident, said 35 people lost their lives as a result of the attack by the bandits in the village.\n\nHe added that, a joint security task force comprising military, police, NSCDC had been deployed to the area \u201cand normalcy has been restored right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, their corpses were taken to Faru town where they were buried.\n\nShehu stated that the police could not reach the affected communities on time when they were informed of the bandits\u2019 attack due to the road network.\n\n\u201cThe police personnel tried their best to reach the affected communities on receiving the information that the bandits were there but unfortunately they could not reach the places because of the bad roads,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the \u201cpolice are currently working tirelessly\u201d to arrest the bandits.\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina",
