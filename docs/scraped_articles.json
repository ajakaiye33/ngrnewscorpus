          "text": "Nigerian workers on Sunday demanded a better deal from governments at all levels as they joined their counterparts across the world to celebrate this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nIn Oyo State, the Academic Staff Union of Universities flayed the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for the corruption in the country, its disposition to the plight of workers and insecurity.\n\nThe Chairman of ASUU, University of Ibadan branch, Prof. Ayoola Akinwole, in a statement to commemorate May Day described the political elite in the country as a group of ravaging bandits looting the treasury in the name of politics.\n\nThe union said it was unfortunate those in government were concerned only about how to remain in power rather than seeking an end to the issues which caused ASUU strike and others that had turned workers to slaves in their fatherland.\n\nAkinwole said, \u201cWorkers\u2019 Day in Nigeria had turned into a day of lamentation when dirges are sung to fallen workers who have died in their numbers from poverty; as a result of unpaid wages, kidnapping for ransom, and unsustainable remuneration.\n\n\u201cThe human development index in Nigeria bears no repetition. Ours has become a story of no and never (to workers\u2019 demands); failure and fear (in genuine legal business transactions); death and disasters (using public utilities and infrastructures).\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State chapter of the Nigerian Labour Congress said it will only support governorship candidates that will agree to resolve it demands as contained in a five-point charter.\n\nThe chairperson of NLC in the state, Sunny James, said the union would invite all governorship candidates to the Labour House after their primaries to deliberate on items that will bring good governance to Akwa Ibom people.\n\nHe listed the items on the charter to include; living wage and prioritisation of workers welfare, education, healthcare, industrialisation of the state economy and physical security, social protection and good governance.\n\nThe state governor, Udom Emmanuel, in his remarks, commended workers for their support and resilience to enhance the development of the state.\n\nEmmanuel, who was represented by the deputy governor, Mr Moses Ekpo, said without the collaboration of workers, the state government would not have achieved giant strides so far.\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives lamented that Nigerian workers are observing the Labour Day \u201cin pain, agony and despair, given the suffocating working condition and general economic hardship occasioned by the insensitive, corrupt and overtly inept All Progressives Congress administration.\u201d\n\nGombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, assured workers that his administration will continue to sustain and deepen the existing friendly working environment and industrial harmony in the state.\n\nHe said this was aimed at increasing productivity of the workforce in particular and improving good governance in general.\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Mr Douye Diri, acceded to some of the demands of the state NLC and TUC bordering on welfare to motivate the government\u2019s workforce.\n\nHe gave approval for the implementation of the requests while responding to \u2018a shopping list\u2019 contained in the joint address presented by the state chairman of the NLC, John Ndiomu, at the May Day event which was held at the Peace Park, Yenagoa, on Sunday.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission hailed Nigerian workers for their contribution to the nation\u2019s stability and economic development over the years despite challenges.\n\nThe chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said these in his message to Nigerian workers on the occasion of the international workers day celebrated every May 1.\n\nSpeaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ibrahim Abdullahi, has commended Governor Abdullahi Sule for keeping to his promise to pay six months outstanding salary arrears to the newly recruited 496 teachers in the state.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2026as pensioners protest over unpaid gratuities\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Sunday, announced the upward review of the state workers\u2019 minimum wage from N30,000 to N40,000 in commemoration of the 2022 Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nObaseki made the announcement in Benin while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 Day speech at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium.\n\nObaseki, who stated that his government was the first to take this initiative after the COVID-19 pandemic, said, \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend that we do not know that our workers are suffering.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum (wage) for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000 a month. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\n\nObaseki, who said his government would have loved to pay more, noted that, \u201cwe hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government.\n\n\u201cBut as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nThe governor reiterated the minimum wage review in a series of tweets on his Twitter page, @GovernorObaseki.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cI announced that we have reviewed the minimum wage for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000 a month. Although we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment will enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with.\n\n\u201cTo our workers; your welfare is our number one priority. As a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices, so that our workers can live a better life. Happy Workers\u2019 Day.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some pensioners in the state who retired in 2012 stormed the venue of the event protesting the non-payment of their gratuities.\n\nThe pensioners, who wore black attires and carried placards, appealed to Obaseki to rescue them by paying their gratuities.\n\nOne of them, Irene Aiguobarueghian, said since their retirement, they were only being paid their monthly pay but yet to get their gratuities.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe have come here to beg the governor to pay us our gratuity. Since 2012, he has collected our money and he has not paid us. He has not said anything about our gratuity, we are begging him to pay us. We have been receiving monthly pay but he has not said anything about our gratuity.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the hardship experienced by pensioners and other senior citizens in the state owing to the inflation rate in the country, Obaseki said, \u201cI am particularly interested in our senior citizens because they are one of the most vulnerable in our society. We took interest in payments of outstanding pensions to our pensioners although these pensions were held by the previous administration.\n\n\u201cIn view of the prevailing economic circumstances, I have now approved, effective this May, the agreement we reached with the Union of Pensioners that the harmonised amount would be paid from May 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by the pensioners due to the non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge, and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cWe are not a government that runs away from responsibilities. We will look for a way out to clear all the gratuities. We have cleared all the pension arrears and we will now focus on all the adjustments. I have directed that all the harmonised amounts we have agreed upon, we will begin payment this month.\n\n\u201cThe purchasing power of an average worker continues to decrease. I want to appeal to the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency on food security; if this is not done, we cannot predict what will happen next.\n\n\u201cFor optimum performance of our workers, we have resolved to do an upward review of the salary of workers of Edo State. The minimum wage will now be N40,000 per month as against the previous payment of N30,000.\u201d\n\nEarlier in their speeches, the two workers\u2019 unions, the Nigerian Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress, applauded the governor on the development of infrastructure in the state.\n\nThe Acting State Chairman of NLC, Comrade Odion Olaye, called on the state government to equip members of the vigilante who have been providing security and called for proper funding of the state-owned tertiary institutions by reviewing the subvention.\n\nHe also appealed to the State House of Assembly to vote for Local Government Autonomy and autonomy to Judicial workers in the on-going review of the 1999 Constitution, while also appealing for the reconstruction of dilapidated public schools.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari led Federal Government over the failure to protect the rights to life, security, and dignity of the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack as well as the failure to secure the safe release of those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nTerrorists had on March 28 attacked the AK9 Abuja\u2013Kaduna train, killing at least nine people, wounding several others, and abducting an unknown number of passengers.\n\nThe victims have remained with the terrorists for a month, despite repeated appeals for the government to free them from captivity.\n\nThe suit followed reports that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) failed to approve funds for surveillance equipment that could have helped to prevent the train attack.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNIN-SIM: SERAP drags Buhari to court over 72m blocked lines\n\nIn the suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, last week, before the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja, the organization, sought for \u201ca declaration that the train attack, abductions and killings of passengers by terrorists amount to a failure by the government to protect Nigerians and to prevent these grave human rights violations.\n\n\u201cAn order directing the Buhari government to protect, promote, and fulfil the human rights of Nigerians, including travellers across the country, by ensuring adequate security and taking measures to prevent attacks.\n\n\u201cAn order directing the Buhari government to urgently find and identify all the passengers, victims and their families, and to pay adequate monetary compensation of N50 million to each of the passengers and victims and their families.\n\nIn the suit filed together with an application for an expedited hearing, SERAP posited that \u201cThe Buhari government has a legal duty to protect individuals from real and immediate risks to their lives and security caused by actions of third-parties such as terrorists.\n\nIt also argued that \u201cA fundamental notion of contemporary human rights law is that victims of violations such as the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack enjoy an independent right to effective remedies. Rights without remedies are ineffectual, rendering illusory the government\u2019s duty to protect such rights.\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari government has failed to protect the constitutionally and internationally guaranteed rights of the victims of the train attack to life, dignity and security, and their right to an effective remedy.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi read in part: \u201cThe Buhari government is under a legal obligation to protect the life of every citizen in the country.\n\n\u201cRemedies logically should be proportionate to the gravity of the harm or violations caused by the government and its agents or by terrorists or unknown perpetrators.\n\n\u201cHuman life has a special value and dignity which requires legal protection. It is the principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation.\n\n\u201cThe officials of the Buhari government have publicly stated that they knew or had information that an attack on the train was imminent but the government failed and/or neglected to take measures to prevent the train attack.\n\n\u201cThe government will still be held accountable for failing or neglecting to guarantee and protect human rights regardless of whether such violations are directly or indirectly attributable to the government or its officials.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari government has an obligation to promote and protect the rights to life, security and dignity. This obligation means that the government must create an enabling environment that facilitates the enjoyment of these rights by the people.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the Buhari government to protect and guarantee the rights to life, security, liberty and dignity of the passengers and victims of the train attack violates the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari government and the Nigeria Railway Corporation had ignored several warnings in the past to take preventive measures to provide adequate security for the train services, and to suspend late rail services to prevent attack by terrorists and to ensure the security and safety of passengers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, no date has been fixed for the hearing the application for an expedited hearing, and the substantive suit.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Once insecurity infests the land, a number of things happen. Career politicians have devised a means to mislead the youths.\n\n\u201cThey use them to do the misdeeds during electioneering campaigns; we have to put a stop to that madness. We need to re-orientate our youths. They are way better than that.

Why are we not exploring the ICT? A Benue youth is a very intelligent person and I think there is more we can do to get them back on the job.\n\n\u201cWe need to get them to understand that as an Agrarian state, there is so much they can do to get themselves enriched.\u201d\n\nHe also said that he is the most qualified and accepted aspirant as a result of the integrity which I have built over the last 32 years.\n\n\u201cI am the top contender in the state who is to beat for the post of the governor. The last time I checked at this very minute that I am checking, I am the most popular and it is not just because of the popular influence.\n\n\u201cMy folks know I have the integrity and am a very responsible person. In the last 32 years, I have been in public service and I have managed people\u2019s lives. Governance is about prioritisation.

year\u2019s Workers Day celebration.\n\nThey called on the state government to review the salaries of the workforce, complaining that they can no longer sustain their households with their salaries following the present economic realities in the country.\n\nThe State Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Leonard Nkah and the State Chairman of Nigeria Union of local government Employees (NULGE), Stanley Ewah made the call in separate addresses to the State Governor, David Umahi.\n\nMr Ewah in his address urged the Umahi to ensure speedy passage of the bill on local government autonomy as passed by the National Assembly and transmitted to the State Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn response to the yearnings of our members, we are pleading for espeditious financial implementation of the promotion arrears as graciously approved and full implementation of the new minimum wage\u201d, he added.\n\nMr Nkah while appreciating the recent promotion released and the regular payment of their salaries, however, noted that \u201cthe take-home from their salaries, can no longer take care of their home,\u201d.\n\nHe therefore, requested \u201ca salary review to enable the workers to cope with the present economic realities in the country.\u201d\n\nThe Ebonyi workers, according to the NLC Chairman also appealed to Governor Umahi to increase the workforce of the State since the interview recruitment exercise for the civil servants has been conducted to reduce the rate of unemployment in the state.\n\n\u201dWith a due sense of humility, Your Excellency, we kindly request for your consideration and approval of the outcome of the already conducted interview and exams of the applicants for the state civil service because it will help to reduce the rate of unemployment facing the state and country in general.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the governor that since the recruitment interview has been conducted that we expect the workforce should be increased on time so that the next governor will not say the action was targeted to heap wage bill on the administration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe workers recalled that \u201cin the public service, in the authorized establishment in the budget of every year, vacancies are created, for conversion and promotion of the workforce and if not implemented, the vacancies created will continue to affect the wheel of service.\u201d\n\nThey, therefore, urged Governor Umahi to complement his efforts in keeping the service alive, for optimal productivity, saying that \u201cthere is a need for immediate approval of conversion and advancement of workers who are due and qualified with the requisite credentials to fill the vacancies created in the authorized establishment of 2022.\u201d\n\nOn the suspension of some senior staff of some senior staff for alleged extortion of some civil servants during the recent promotion exercise Mr Nkah pleaded with the governor to rescind the decision of stopping their salary to avoid heaping unjust injuries on their families as their love ones depend on their salaries to survive.\n\nHe said the suspended staff had to collect some fee in other to be able to process the documents as most of the equipments for the issuance o grey documents had broken down.\n\n\u201cFrom the available investigation on our table, we found out that almost 90 per cent of the manual typewriters of the offices in charge on the issuance of the G-35 are either dysfunctional or not available.\u201d\n\nThe NLC Chairman lamentee the difficult working condition of workers at the Ochudo Secretariat describing their experience as pitiable.\n\nHe expressed concern about how the workers trek to their offices and homes every day, even under the hectic sun and rain due to inadequate transport provisionto the secretariat.\n\nHe therefore requested that a mini-transport scheme be provided by the state government to be taking the workers to their various blocks and back to their residential locations at the close of work to give their best.\n\nMr Nkah stated that Ebonyi State is not lagging in her commitment to putting smiles on the faces of its senior citizens.\n\nHe however called for the review of the pension in line with Section 210(3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which stipulates taht pension review be carried out every five years.\n\nThe organized labour while appreciating Governor Umahi for the payment of pensions in the stat, requested that the outstanding gratuities due to the pensioners be paid to enable them to cope with the current economic realities.\n\nThe workers commended the governor for his tireless efforts in combatting communal crises in Ebonyi State but noted that the arrears of the previously suspended salaries of the public servants from Effium and Ezza Effium in Ohaukwu LGA should be paid to them, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe got to know that they have received the April 2022 salary but the arrears of the other months are still hanging,\u201d he observed\u201d, Mr Nkah said.

Disagreement and debate have always been part of the relationship between labour and the government. Even as we disagree today, we must not do so as mortal adversaries but as members of the same progressive family. We both want the same thing \u2013 a country that works for all and offers each citizen a fair deal \u2013 even if occasionally we differ on how to achieve this goal. But at all times, we have through dialogue found a path forward.\n\n\u201cIt in this spirit that I call on ASUU to embrace dialogue with the Government and I call on the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress to help facilitate a resolution of this dispute through dialogue. I believe that we can find a path forward in good faith. And this is what we will do\u201d, Osinbajo stated.\n\nHe revealed that the Buhari administration has pursued various progressive agenda for inclusion and social protection in a period of global turbulence.\n\n\u201cWe have not had the benefit of record-high oil prices to work with; instead we have had to contend with recessions, the collapse of international oil prices, the COVID-19 pandemic which stalled the global economy and even now, we must deal with the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine which is having a disruptive impact on global commodity markets. Regardless of all these challenges, this administration has been steadfast in tackling the issues facing Nigerian workers.\n\n\u201cThis is why President Buhari implemented an increase in the national minimum wage in 2019.\n\nThe outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 practically brought the world to a standstill. As we battled to contain the spread of the corona virus here in Nigeria, almost all economic activity was grounded. But we understood the dangers that portended to our citizens and to our general economy. That is why during the pandemic, the Federal Government placed Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSME) employees on payroll support to get them through the period, as part of its Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\nWe introduced the food for jobs agricultural programme. Providing support for over 4 million farmers. We started the most ambitious social housing programme in our nations history , 300,000 homes at N2m. As part of the same Economic Sustainability Plan we started the solar Naija programme to connect 5million homes with solar power.\n\n\u201cWe set up the MSME Survival Fund which disbursed over N56.8 billion to over 800, 000 people. The Fund also provided grants, free business registration and payroll support to over 1 million artisans, micro and small business owners.\n\n\u201cWe have increased the retirement age of teachers so that they can spend more years in service educating our children. Recently, we implemented an upward review of the salaries and wages of the men and women of the Nigeria Police Force as part of our broader commitment to improving the welfare and service conditions of those charged with safeguarding the rest of us\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nAs pressure continue to mount on former President Goodluck Jonathan to contest the 2023 presidential election, two renown lawyers in the country have sharply disagreed on his eligibility to run for the presidency.\n\nWhile human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN) is of the opinion that Jonathan is legally hamstrung to contest for the highest position in the country, his colleague of other inner bar and an activist lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), argued otherwise insisting that the former president is eligible to return to Aso Rock.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nFemi Falana, in his submission on the subject matter argued that former President Goodluck Jonathan cannot contest in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nWhile citing constitutional provisions barring the ex-president from seeking re-election, Falana said Jonathan, who was Nigerian president between 2010 and 2015, would breach constitutional term limits of two terms of eight years if he runs for the presidency and wins again.\n\nHe recalled that Mr Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umaru Yar\u2019adua, Yaradua and later contested and won the 2011 presidential election.\n\nMr Jonathan spent five years in office as President which would make it nine years in office if he contests and wins again, Mr Falana said.\n\n\u201cDr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. The reason is that if he wins the election he will spend an additional term of four years.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cIt means that he would spend a cumulative period of nine years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years,\u201d Mr Falana said.\n\nHe further stated that by virtue of section 137 (3) of the Nigerian constitution, Mr Jonathan cannot seek a re-election to the office of the president having completed the tenure of the late President Yar\u2019adua and sworn in again for a full four-year term in 2011 upon winning the presidential election in his own name.\n\nSection 137 (3) of the Constitution in reference reads: \u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as President shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\u201d\n\nBut faulting this line of argument, Ozekhome said: \u201cThe truth of the matter is that the antagonists of Jonathan running in 2022, in their strange line of argument, are mainly relying on the above section 137(3). They have probably not adverted their minds to sections 141 of the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended, and section 285(13) of the same Fourth Alteration to the 1999 Constitution, as amended, which they are relying on. More revealing is that these antagonists are probably not aware of an extant and subsisting Court of Appeal decision where Jonathan was frontally confronted and challenged before the 2015 presidential election, on the same ground of being ineligible to contest the said 2015 election, having allegedly been elected for two previous terms of office. The section 137(3) being relied upon by the antagonists was signed into law in 2018, three years after Jonathan had left office. Can he be caught in its web retrospectively?\n\nThe case in question is CYRIACUS NJOKU V GOODLUCK EBELE JONATHAN (2015) LPELR-244496 (CA). In that case, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, held that President Goodluck Jonathan had only taken the oath of office once and therefore upheld his eligibility to contest the then Nigeria\u2019s presidential election slated for March 28, 2015.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe intermediate court held that the oath of office President Jonathan took in 2010 was merely to complete the \u201cunexpired tenure\u201d of late President Umar Yar\u2019Adua, who died while in office as President.\n\nThe appeal had been brought before the court by one Cyriacus Njoku, who was challenging the ruling of the High Court of Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, which on March 1, 2013, had dismissed the suit he filed to stop President Jonathan from contesting the 2015 polls.\n\nIn a lead judgement delivered by Justice Abubakar Yahaya, the full panel of the court unanimously held that President Jonathan had only spent one term in office as President, going by the provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nPresident Jonathan had been empowered as acting President on February 9, 2010, following a motion for operation of the \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d by the Senate, owing to the protracted stay of late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua in Saudi Arabia on medical grounds.\n\nWhen President Yar\u2019Adua eventually died on May 5, 2010, Jonathan was sworn in as president to serve the unexpired residue of office of Yar\u2019Adua. Jonathan was later elected President in 2011 for the first time, on his own merit.\n\nHowever, the court ruled that the oath that Jonathan took in 2010 was merely to complete the unexpired tenure of late Yar\u2019Adua; adding that by virtue of Section 135 (2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution, Jonathan only took his first oath in May, 2011. The Court of Appeal further held that disqualification is through election, not oath taking.\n\nis therefore clear that section 137(3) of the Fourth Alteration to the Constitution took effect from 11th June, 2018, when President Muhammadu Buhari assented to it. Section 137(3) is subject to section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution which provides that, \u201cthe Interpretation Act shall apply for the purposes of interpreting (its) provisions\u201d.\n\nSection 137(3) is one piece of legislation that can be termed retrospective or retroactive legislation.\n\nOn retrospectivity of legislation, the apex court, coram Justice Kekere-Ekun, J.S.C, held in the case of SPDC V. ANARO & ORS (2015) LPELR-24750(SC) at (Pp. 64 paras. B), thus:\n\n\u201cThere is a general presumption against retrospective legislation. It is presumed that the legislature does not intend injustice or absurdity. Courts therefore lean against giving certain statutes retrospective operation. Generally, statutes are construed as operating only in cases or on facts, which come into existence after the statutes were passed unless a retrospective effect is clearly intended. It was held inter alia, in: Ojokolobo Vs Alamu (1987) 3 NWLR (Pt.61) 377 @ 402 F-H that it is a fundamental rule of Nigerian law that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation unless such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Act or Law; or arises by necessary and distinct implication. See also: Udoh Vs O.H.M.B. (1993) 7 NWLR (Pt.304) 39 @ 149 F \u2013 G; Adegbenro Vs Akintola (1963) All NLR 305 @ 308.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*Ruling party\u2019s position careless, ill-considered, says PANDEF\n\n*APC\u2019s claim, an invitation to anarchy, South-south Elders\u2019 Forum warns*Withdraw statement on zoning, Arewa youths tell Adamu\n\n*APC must zone presidency to South-east, Ohanaeze insists\n\nDeji Elumoye, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Segun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nCondemnations have trailed the claim by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday that it had not decided on where to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had before the party\u2019s March 26 National Convention, stated that even though the ruling party had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Senator Abdullahi Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of Adamu from the North is a strong indication that the presidential candidate of the party will automatically come from the South.\n\n\n\nBut Adamu, who spoke on the controversial zoning issue after presenting the party\u2019s candidate in the forthcoming Ekiti State governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, on Friday, said the party had not taken any zoning decision.\n\n\n\nHe said such a decision would be the job of the entire party, which he said was bigger than himself as chairman.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am today privileged to be the Chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Arewa Consultative Youth Forum (ACYF), and the South-South Elders\u2019 Forum (SSEF) have condemned the indecision of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday said he would support President Muhammadu Buhari and APC\u2019s preferred candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nIn its reaction to APC\u2019s indecision on zoning, PANDEF described Adamu\u2019s claim as careless and ill-considered.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on the issue, PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, noted that with the swapping of positions between the North and South, the understanding was that the presidential candidate of the party would come from the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can he (Adamu) make such a remark? Do they mean well for this country at all? This is a man who emerged as National Chairman of the party through the instrumentality of zoning,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nHe noted that all the positions in the party had been switched between the South and North.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is an established political stratagem of political parties in the country that any time the national chairmanship position of a party goes to the South, the presidency goes to the North and the other way round. In 2014, the APC zoned its national chairmanship position to the South, and the presidency went to the North; therefore, in 2023, the presidency of the APC, and indeed, any serious political party in Nigeria must go to the South. Anything otherwise would be more than an overture to undesirable cataclysms in the country,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlso reacting, the SSEF warned that any attempt to deny the South the position of the presidential candidate of the APC would be an invitation to anarchy.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Leader of the SSEF, Chief Anabs Sara-Igbe, such a decision will give ethnic nationalities in the South a sense that they are not wanted in the country.\n\n\n\nSara-Igbe expressed the fear that any attempt to jettison the unwritten gentlemen\u2019s agreement between the North and the South would lead to a catastrophic reaction, the end of which nobody can predict.\n\nOn its part, the ACYF has called on the National Chairman of APC, Adamu, to withdraw his statement that the party had not taken a position on zoning.\n\n\n\nThe ACYF, in a statement yesterday, said the statement credited to Adamu was capable of heating the polity and spelling doom for the party if not quickly withdrawn.\n\n\n\nThe group said it was worrisome that the party chairman could come up with such an inflammable statement when all critical stakeholders are already on the same page on the need for the presidency to return to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate statement credited to Senator Adamu is regrettable just as it is demeaning of his status as the chairman of a ruling party.\n\n\u201cEven a political novice is aware that the consensus from critical political stakeholders is that the presidency must return to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis statement that no agreement had been reached on zoning is not in the best interest of the party.\n\n\u201cThe statement is capable of leading to electoral defeat for our great party if not quickly withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a statement that can confuse, overheat the polity and eventually lead to electoral defeat.\n\n\u201cLeaders must learn to weigh their words and also feel the pulse of the people when making statements on issues as important as this,\u201d AYCF explained.\n\n\n\nIn its reaction, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate strong courage and leadership by prevailing on his party to zone the 2023 presidency to the South-east.\n\n\n\nSpeaking through its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the organisation said those who came up with the issue of dividing the country along zonal structures were not wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome patriots tried to create six zones for the country and this was done to ensure equity, justice and fairness. That singular action has helped to stabilise the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the same wisdom that made President Olusegun Obasanjo to ensure the emergence of a northerner in 2007 even when the odds strongly favoured the then Governor Peter Odili. Since then, power has been moving from North to South.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time around, Buhari has to decide and ensure that nothing truncates this process to maintain peace, unity and corporate existence of Nigeria. As the leader of the country and the leader of the APC, President Buhari must demonstrate strong courage by ensuring that power is moved to South-east after him,\u201d the organisation noted.\n\n\n\nThe organisation, however, warned that anything outside zoning the presidency to the South-east zone would not only boomerang but threaten the nation\u2019s very existence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way APC prevaricates over this issue of zoning is troubling. We however believe that the onus lies on the president; but if he chooses to play the ostrich, he should also bear in mind that history will not be kind to him. He must sail this ship to safe harbour.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they fail to do the needful, let them bear in mind that restiveness, insecurity and cries of marginalisation will never cease and those championing such will be right. The President must write his name in gold by doing the right thing,\u201d Ogbonnia explained.\n\nI will Support Whoever is Buhari, APC\u2019s Choice, Says Amaechi\n\nIn another development, the Minister of Transportation, Amaechi, yesterday said he would support President Buhari and APC\u2019s chosen candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nAmaechi expressed his loyalty to President Buhari and the APC.\n\nAmaechi, in a statement, said this at a consultative meeting with executives, delegates and another party faithful at the Rivers APC Secretariat at the weekend.\n\n\n\nThe minister indicated that in his bid to become the President of Nigeria, which he is thoroughly qualified for, he was neither desperate nor disloyal.\n\n\n\nThe two terms governor of Rivers said it was sad that many politicians do not understand the concept of loyalty.\n\n\u201cLoyalty is not when you are not chosen, you become disloyal, loyalty means you follow the man that leads you, that you have surrendered to his leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t follow, it means you are not loyal, you are only benefitting from the man politically and economically. The day he\u2019s not able to give you that economic reality, is the day you become disloyal.\n\n\u201cI am a very loyal person, and those who are disloyal, I wish them well, those who want to do whatever they want to do, I wish them well,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the opportunity will be given to everybody and all will run in this presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe will run and I am loyal to the President and I am loyal to the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the party says it is me, thank God. If the party says it is not me, whoever the party chooses, I will support it.\n\n\u201cIf the party and President choose anybody, I will support the person, if the party chooses me, I will be glad and say thank God,\u201d Amaechi explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had, just before the party\u2019s National Convention, said even though the APC had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nResponding to the issue of when political appointees who intend to contest in the election are expected to resign, especially in the light of the party\u2019s recently issued guidelines for people in that category, Adamu declined comment, saying \u201cthe matter is currently in court.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cOur luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it will be subjudice for me to discuss it at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the cost of the party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, which many considered rather high, the Chairman said the party had no regret setting the prices at the current rate, citing the need to protect the party from unserious aspirants, moles, as well as the need to generate money to run the election processes.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through presidential campaigns, go through election for the President. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contest, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheap by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, they will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from. If, God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million, it\u2019s no news.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression (of interest). When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it cost him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue begging.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election. Some protests may be well founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume \u2018it\u2019s the ruling party\u2019, is quick\u2026 in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI will not quarrel with that, everyone of us has the right to express himself, and I\u2019m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where it pinches us the most.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn reports that the process of settling for a presidential candidate could tear the party apart, if not carefully handled, Adamu said: \u201cGod will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out, by the grace of God, at the appropriate time, our great party will choose the candidate at the convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not want to speculate, but my duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes and I\u2019ve always found it easier and more noble to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not there yet.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s Presidential Aspirants Lengthen to 13\n\n\n\nThe number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC jumped to 13 yesterday as the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, sent out a notice that he would formally declare for president next Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nFayemi joins a long list that includes Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu; ex-governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former president of the Senate, Ken Nnamani; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nFive of the presidential aspirants have so far paid N100 million and picked up their forms. Those who did were Tinubu, Umahi, Bello, Nwajiuba and Okorocha.\n\n\n\nNnamani, while declaring his intention to run for president yesterday, promised to improve on the legacy of President Buhari, while also demanding for the reduction of the cost of interest and nomination forms for aspirants seeking elective posts under the APC.\n\n\n\nHe said compared with other aspirants, he was the most suited for the job of the President.\n\nNnamani said his pedigree as the President of the Senate and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Constitutional and Electoral Reform make him the right candidate.\n\n\n\nOkorocha picked his presidential expression of interest and nomination forms yesterday, insisting that Nigeria\u2019s biggest challenge remains the inability to create wealth.\n\nOkorocha, who was presented the documents by \u201cThe New Nigeria Team\u201d, in his Unity House office in Abuja, maintained that he remained the right candidate to take over from Buhari, promising that his government would be pro-people.\n\nTinubu Support Groups (TSG) yesterday picked the N100 million Expression of Interest and nomination forms on behalf of Tinubu.\n\n\n\nThe TSG team was led by a member representing Ikeja Federal constituency in the House of Representatives and the Chairman House Committee on Finance, Hon. James Faleke.\n\nFaleke said Tinubu paid for his form personally but asked them to pick it up on his behalf because he was out of the country.\n\nThe lawmaker stressed that Tinubu was the candidate to beat, no matter the mode of primaries adopted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\n\u201cAsiwaju at the appropriate time will deliver his address to us, but I know that this country under Tinubu will be better off. Economy will be better off because he is an economist, he is not a lawyer, he is an economist. He will deal with the economic situation of this country. He did it in Lagos, the security challenges in Lagos were solved by him. He will solve the same security challenges. He is a man who rewards loyalty, who ensures that people who work are also taken care of.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal said Tinubu is a branded product, adding that every Nigerian knows that he is the man to beat.\n\n\n\nOn his chances, he noted, \u201cIf we were not sure we have chances to win this election we would not waste our N100 million. Everybody\u2019s free to buy the forms if he has N100 million. The choice is his own. He has the money. But as far as we are concerned, we are only fulfilling the constitutional requirement of campaigning and going for election. We don\u2019t foresee any opposition in the contest.\u201d\n\nPDP Screens Presidential Aspirants\n\n\n\nThe PDP yesterday screened all its presidential aspirants ahead of its National Convention slated for May 30.\n\nFormer senate president, David Mark headed the presidential screening committee.\n\nAll the presidential aspirants like the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, former secretary to the government of federation Anyim Pius Anyim, Chief Dele Momodu, Peter Obi, Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, Governor Emmanuel Udom, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Mohammed Hayatu-deen and Ayo Fayose, were at the screening.\n\n\n\nThe committee at the end of the sitting disqualified two aspirants.\n\nMark confirmed this after the conclusion of the exercise at Legacy House, Abuja, at 7pm yesterday.\n\nHe, however, refused to disclose the identities of the disqualified aspirants or the reasons for their disqualification.\n\nMark simply noted that the aspirants did not meet the requirements.\n\n\n\nBut sources told THISDAY that the likely disqualified aspirants were Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Cosmas Ndukwe. Ndukwe took the party to court over zoning.\n\nMark also affirmed that the report of the screening will be transmitted to the PDP National Working Committee for consideration Friday night.\n\n\n\nAnyim, who spoke to reporters after screening, described the process as simple, explaining that they were asked about their financial capabilities for campaigns, when they became members of the party and their tax papers.\n\nAlso speaking after screening, former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose warned the party against jettisoning zoning \u201cas it will hurt the PDP in the future.\u201d\n\nBut Governor Emmanuel disagreed saying, \u201cany decision taken by the PDP on zoning is supreme and must be obeyed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso Peter Obi who described the screening exercise as perfect said that he would respect the position of the party on zoning.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Germany to return 1,130 looted Benin bronzes to Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday backed the planned ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum that would house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts being returned to Nigeria, for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\n\n\nThe President announced his support while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, H.R.M. Omo N\u2019Oba Uku Akpolokpolo Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at the State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Museum, to be housed in the palace of the Oba of Benin, is in conjunction with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).\n\n\n\nThe Oba of Benin told the President: \u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin Bronzes and artefacts, not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u201cwe hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, the President declared that the federal government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of Nigeria\u2019s looted artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta/bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the returned artefacts, Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom, as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\n\n\n\nHe noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\n\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works were records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria would not permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration had made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts.\n\n\n\nThe President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the federal Government would continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIn furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, \u201cNigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts to their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the NCMM currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes.\n\n\n\nHe expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria could generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the NCMM are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on travelling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\n\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Discloses Ife terracotta, bronze heads due from Netherlands, US *Says repatriated antiquities potential revenue earners\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Friday declared that the Federal Government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of looted Nigeria\u2019s artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta and bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums. The President gave the assurance while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\nSpeaking on the return of the artefacts, President Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin. He noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works are records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria cannot permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration has made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts. The President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the Federal Government will continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018In furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.\n\nThe legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York\u201d. President Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, Nigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts back to their countries of origin.\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes. He expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria can generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nAccording to him: \u2018\u2018We look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\u2018\u2018I am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on traveling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\u2018\u2018This can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times\u201d\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Oba of Benin informed the President that his Royal Court had concluded plans with the NCMM to establish an ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum to house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\nHe said:\u2018\u2018We want to reassure Mr President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin bronzes and artefacts not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u2018\u2018we hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u2019\u2019Also speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Right Of Nigerian Workers To Participate In Politics, By Femi Falana",
          "text": "The official history of Nigeria claims that the Independence of Nigeria was won by nationalist politicians on the platter of gold. But contrary to such dubious claim the Nigerian workers, women and the youths who fought for the nation's independence suffered casualties in the hands of the British colonial police. Apart from killing women who demanded for cancellation of double taxation and workers who demanded better conditions of service the colonial regime jailed young activists who demanded for a socialist reconstruction of Nigeria. In fact, it was for this reason that the British government entered into a class alliance with the nationalist politicians with a view to retaining the status quo in order to protect the interests of imperialism. Hence, flag independence was packaged and bequeathed to the nationalist politicians in October 1960.\n\nWhen the civilian regime was sacked in 1966 by military officers who later led the nation to fight a civil war and installed a regime of repression and corruption it was the working class and other progressive forces that fought against unending military dictatorship. However, successive military and civilian regimes ensured, through draconian laws and backward civil service rules that Nigerian workers are completely ostracised from the political terrain. It is on record that majority of the politicians who formed the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) in May 1994 had served military regimes in various capacities. They were therefore involved in the struggle against military dictatorship after the annulment of the results of the June 12, 1993 presidential election won by Bashorun MKO Abiola, only for restoration back to power and preservation of class interests.\n\nAt the end of military rule the political class who took over the reins of power have made a complete mockery of constitutional rule and endangered the democratic process. Happily, the Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress have resolved to reposition the Labour Party to contest political power with members of the ruling class. In order to achieve the historic objective the labour movement should proceed to mobilise Nigerian workers and allies to embark on mass registration of the members of the Labour Party. This has become a daunting task in view of the undeniable fact that the members of the political class have virtually collapsed the neocolonial State through the implementation of anti people's political and economic programmes for the past 23 years.\n\n\n\nThe dividend of democracy promised by the ruling class parties has turned out to be worsening insecurity, gross economic mismanagement and grand corruption. Since the resolution of the labour movement to mobilise the oppressed people of Nigeria to get organised and participate in the electoral politics of the country is going to be questioned by the ruling class it is pertinent to point out that the fundamental right of workers to belong to the Labour Party is recognized by section 40 of the Nigerian Constitution which provides that \"every person shall be entitled to assembly freely and associate with other persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any association for the protection of his interests.\"\n\nLike other citizens, workers are equally entitled, by virtue of section 39 of the Constitution, to freedom of expression, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart ideas and information without interference. In Inspector-General of Police v All Nigeria Peoples Party (2008) 12(WRN 65 the Court of Appeal annulled the issuance of police permit for rallies and other public meetings on the grounds that it was a breach of the fundamental rights of citizens to freedom of expression and association guaranteed by sections 39 and 40 of the Constitution. In line with the judgment, section 83 of the Police Establishment Act 2020 has imposed a duty on the police to provide adequate security for participants in peaceful rallies and public meetings.\n\nIn addition to constitutional provisions the Government of Nigeria has ratified the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)5 both of 1966 as well the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) 1981 which guarantee freedom of association and freedom of expression. Indeed, the right of workers to associate and organise is enshrined in the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948 (No. 87)6 and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention 1949 (No. 98) of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Section 254C(2) of the Constitution has conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the National Industrial Court to enforce provisions of all ILO Conventions that have been ratified by Nigeria.\n\nIn the case of Independent National Electoral Commission v Balarabe Musa & Ors (2003) 10 WRN 1 the Supreme Court faulted the civil service rules which restrict the participation of civil servants and other public servants in the politics of the county. In the leading judgment of the apex court, the Honourable Justice Ayoola JSC held that \"There is nothing reasonably justifiable in a democratic society in the interest of defense, public safety, public order, public morality or public health in prohibiting a member of the public service or civil service \u2026 from eligibility to be registered as a member of a political party. The submission that the restriction is a valid derogation from section 40 by virtue of section 45 (1)(a) of the Constitution was erroneous.\"\n\nIn his concurring judgment, Mr. Justice Uwais, the then Chief Justice of Nigeria said that \"The provisions of section 40 of the 1999 Constitution are clear. Their import is to allow 'every person,' including public office holders and civil servants, the freedom to assemble freely and associate with other persons to form or belong to any political party, or trade union or any other association for the protection of his interests. The section has made no exception and there is no proviso therein limiting its application to civil servants or public officers.\"\n\nEven though the civil service rules were not set aside as its legal validity was not challenged in the case, it has been held by the Court in several cases that sections 7, 66 (1); 107 (1) (f); 137 (1) (g); 142(2); 182 and 187(2) of the 1999 Constitution permit civil servants and other public officers who wish to contest elections to resign their positions 30 days to the date of elections for all the various positions of the President and Vice President, Governors and Deputy Governors, Federal and State Legislators as well as Chairmen and Councillors. See FAYEMI v. ONI & ORS (2019) LPELR-46623(CA); PPA v. PDP & ORS (2009) LPELR-4865;(CA); ADAMU V. TAKORI (2010) ALL FWLR (P. 540) 1387 (C.A)\n\nNotwithstanding that the Constitution is silent on the right of workers in the private sector to participate in politics it is submitted that they are equally entitled to contest elections without any legal entanglement. However, like civil servants, private sector workers who wish to contest elections are advised, subject to agreements reached with their employers, and/or the applicable conditions of service, to resign their positions or ask for leave of absence. It is therefore incumbent on workers in the private and public sectors to stop agonising about the problems confronting the country. This is the time to get organised with other pro-labour, radical and human rights forces and insist that a new Nigeria is possible.\n\nFemi Falana SAN,\n\nInterim Chair,\n\nAlliance on Surviving Covid 19 and Beyond (ASCAB)\n\nMay Day, 2022.\n\n\n\n",
          "summary": "However, successive military and civilian regimes ensured, through draconian laws and backward civil service rules that Nigerian workers are completely ostracised from the political terrain.\nAt the end of military rule the political class who took over the reins of power have made a complete mockery of constitutional rule and endangered the democratic process.\nHappily, the Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress have resolved to reposition the Labour Party to contest political power with members of the ruling class.\nIn order to achieve the historic objective the labour movement should proceed to mobilise Nigerian workers and allies to embark on mass registration of the members of the Labour Party.\nIt is therefore incumbent on workers in the private and public sectors to stop agonising about the problems confronting the country.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, I watched The Smart Money Woman, and I believe there are many Zuris out there, regardless of gender, race, religion, or employment.\n\nFirst off, who is Zuri? The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate. Since its launch, Eden Life has provided over 150,000 services in Nigeria.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Prosper Otemuyiwa, and Silm Momoh co-founded the company in Nigeria in 2019. It connects busy professionals with concierge services, and a subscription service that delivers high-quality chef-prepared meals, laundry services, and house cleaning.\n\nComing in with a twist: Unlike Lagos, Nairobi users get an additional service: a beauty and wellness service.\n\nWhat you should know about Lynk: The platform was launched in 2015, and it facilitated over 150,000 jobs, transferring $4.5 million to over 2,000 workers across four major verticals: beauty & wellness, cleaning & care, installation, repair & maintenance, and furniture & decor.\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePort 365, an African digital freight forwarding company, has raised $5 million in seed funding to drive end-to-end digitisation of freight management in Africa and support its expansion into new markets.\n\nLed by Mobility 54 \u2014 VC arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group \u2014 SBI Investment, Flexport, ODX, a Singaporean syndicate fund, Samurai Incubate, and other angel investors participated.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do? Launched in 2019 by Hio Sola-Usidame (CEO), the platform covers air freight, ocean freight, inland haulage (trucking, barge, and rail), and Pay-As-You-Go warehousing, marine insurance, customs brokerage, and more.\n\nCurrently, OnePort 365 is creating an operating system for African cross-border trade, assisting traders in managing their freight processes via a digital platform that enables seamless freight forwarding and other value-added services.\n\nAccording to OnePort 365, traders no longer have to wait up to two weeks to compare the best rates from various service providers. They can explore competitive offers on the platform and book freights in 30 seconds or less using pre-negotiated rates.\n\nIt currently operates in Nigeria and Ghana, and is exploring other markets. The platform also makes use of advancements in payment technology and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to enable instant payments.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve efficiency and lower overheads in cross-border trading across the continent, and to launch several new services that will boost overall profitability.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry.

But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain awareness and user education is a background check that must be done to foster blockchain adoption. Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey?

          "text": "With 3.1 percent of the 2022 budget, $1.3 billion, Nigeria could acquire complete doses of the RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine for the current generation of children under five, ending the scourge of a disease that kills 95,000 children yearly.\n\nThis is if the government foots 100 percent of the financial cost of the full vaccination per child estimated at $42.6 in Ghana, $45.77 in Malawi and $56.73 in Kenya, according to a 2021 analysis on the \u2018costs of continuing RTS, S/ASO1E malaria vaccination in the three malaria vaccine pilot implementation countries\u2019.\n\nGoing by the lowest cost of about $43 in Ghana, it will cost Nigeria N540.3 billion (N1.3 billion) to vaccinate 31 million children aged five and below, a vulnerable group that has the highest child mortality caused by malaria in the world.\n\nThe 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey estimated the rate of malaria in children under five at 23 percent. But while their peers in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have been set on the path to build immunity against the Plasmodium parasite, Nigerian children are waiting, surviving on other preventive tools such as insecticide-treated nets, insecticide sprays or seasonal malaria chemoprevention.\n\nThe vaccine has a 30 percent efficacy rate, according to the World Health Organization, and more than 2.3 million doses have been administered in these countries.\n\nAshley Birkett, head of malaria vaccine development at Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), said the ultimate goal is to hit 80 or 90 percent efficacy and achieve a rate that can last several years, according to a statement by Gavi.\n\nWhat FG plans\n\nFor now, the federal government says it expects the supply and administration of the vaccine for children to begin by the end of the first quarter of 2023. This is expected from the initial batch of donor commitment to distribute the vaccine to other African countries.\n\nPerpetua Uhomoibhi, national coordinator of the National Malaria Elimination Programme told BusinessDay that the government had already set all processes in place to ensure that Nigeria would be among the first to receive the supply, which is expected to be limited due to initial high demand.\n\nAccording to her, the government is already working with development partners to develop a framework that will guide the introduction of the vaccine.\n\nRead also: World Malaria Day: Is malaria elimination achievable in Nigeria?\n\nShe said the vaccine would be integrated into the current childhood immunisation programme and administered to children from six months of age.\n\n\u201cWe are already working with the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency and other key stakeholders like the World Health Organization to ensure that Nigeria has a roadmap. The processes have started. We are about to start the assessment of the readiness of the country with our external partners and then draw a framework for the introduction of the vaccine,\u201d Uhomoibhi said.\n\nJohn Bawa, Africa lead, vaccine implementation at PATH, disclosed recently at a webinar, organised by the African Media and Malaria Research Network, that the Gavi application window for the vaccine may close in September 2022.\n\nHe said the patent transfer had been made between GSK and Biotech of India, which is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world for prompt manufacturing of the vaccine, to meet the demand.\n\nThe Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has also secured more than $155 million to support the introduction, procurement and delivery of the malaria vaccine for Gavi-eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa. At least four countries have officially expressed interest in vaccines including Nigeria.\n\nBased on the WHO\u2019s estimate, the malaria vaccine can significantly reduce child illness and death from malaria, and save an additional 80 000 African children annually.",

(FMN) commenced a 71.69 percent stake acquisition of Honeywell Group Limited (HGL) worth N80 billion in November 2021 which has been approved by regulatory agencies.\n\nSimilarly, Moroccan mattress maker Dolidol, backed by African private equity firm Development Partners International (DPI) signed a deal to acquire Mouka, a Nigerian manufacturer of mattresses and pillows for $60 million.\n\nIn April 2022, Suntory Beverage & Food Asia Pacific (SBFAP) announced that it agreed to sell its Nigerian subsidiary \u2013 Suntory Beverage & Food Nigeria (SBFN), to Africa FMCG Distribution Ltd (AFDL) in a transaction said to be worth about $14million is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nMuda Yusuf, Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE) said already the outlook for manufacturing performance is not very bright due to numerous challenges especially the high energy cost which has had intense impact on businesses with diesel cost surging by almost 92 percent while the supply gap has widened due to the limited access to market since the Russia-Ukraine crisis started.\n\nHe added that the impact of this will be more profound on the Small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs), who are much more susceptible to shocks than larger companies.",

          "text": "\u2026Approves payment of harmonized pension from May 2022\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has approved #40,000 as the new minimum wage for workers in the state, in commemoration of this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nThe governor, who made the announcement while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 day speech, said his government will continue to prioritize the welfare of Edo workers, equipping them with the capacity and environment to deliver efficient and quality service to the people.\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend that we do not know that our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000 a month. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government.\n\n\u201cBut as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nReassuring his government\u2019s relentless support to senior citizens in the state, Obaseki lamented the hardship experienced by pensioners and other senior citizens as a result of rising cost of food and other items.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am particularly interested in our senior citizens because they are one of the most vulnerable in our society. We took interest in payments of outstanding pensions to our pensioners in spite of the fact that these pensions were held by the previous administration.\n\n\u201cIn view of the prevailing economic circumstances, I have now approved, effective this May, the agreement we reached with the Union of Pensioners that the harmonized amount would be paid from May 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by the pensioners due to the non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges,\u201d the governor added.\n\nObaseki however urged workers in the state to take advantage of opportunities offered by his administration in the agricultural sector to increase food production in the country.\n\nEarlier in his address, the state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye, charged the federal government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment and hunger in the country.",

Adelere Oriolowo on Saturday, at Iwo, organised a special prayer session for Governor Gboyega Oyetola\u2019s reelection bid ahead of the state\u2019s July 16 governorship election.\n\nThe senator used the occasion to condemn rumours making the round that he is not in good terms with the governor.\n\nThe Iwo born politician said, \u201call those saying the Governor and myself are fighting each other are blackmailers. It is not true.\n\n\u201cThere was never be any disagreement or misunderstanding between me and Governor Oyetola, we are always together.\n\n\u201cThose spreading false information about my relationship with Governor Oyetola are merely looking for cheap publicity and make a living out of falsehood.\n\n\u201cMyself and Mr Governor have been together for long and I have not seen anything that will affect our good relationship.\n\n\u201cToday we decided to have a special prayer for the second term bid of our amiable governor, Alhaji Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola who is contesting for a second term in office.\u201d\n\nSenator Oriolowo, who used the prayer session to declare his intention to run for another term, boasted that he would never be afraid of anyone who may wish to contest the Senatorial seat against him.\n\nHe said he had contested many positions in life and God has given them to him.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that I rose from the position of Pupil Engineer to Permanent Secretary, the highest position in the civil service. This (second term senatorial bid) is not going to be different. I am not afraid because I have done well.\n\n\u201cI am going to say, as it has been said severally that, \u2018no Senator in the history of this state \u2013 I am not saying in the West alone \u2013 has performed as God has helped me to. Be it first timers or otherwise.\n\n\u201cAll these have been achieved through the good office of Mr Governor. And that\u2019s why I am part of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u2019s performance, so if I have performed, he has performed wonderfully too\u201d he said.\n\nWhile speaking at the well attended programme, the Akire of Ikire Ile in Olaoluwa local government area of Osun State, Oba AbdulAzeez Olatunbosun Adebamiji, Ogunkojo II, Ilufemiloye, commended Senator Oriolowo for his transformation programmes to the entire people of the Senatorial District.\n\nThe Akire said, \u201cpropaganda is the dissemination of information of misleading and biased nature to influence public opinions.\n\n\u201cThis is why lies, rumours, half-truths, blackmailing and character assassination are used to dent image of people.\n\n\u201cPoliticians should however, be refined and moderate in their approach.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Alhaji Liadi Tella, who is the Chairman of the prayer session and Council, Federal College of Education, Iwo reaffirmed his assertion that Governor Oyetola deserves second term, while commending Senatorial Oriolowo for organising such a prayer which he described as a timely one.\n\nAlhaji Tella who described Oyetola as an excellent manager of man and materials, added that Oyetola is a great manager of finances and development-oriented.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola took the state out of depts of half-salary to the glory of comfort to the betterment of workers and retirees. Hospital rehabilitations are going on, and the economy is booming in spite of no bigger resources available to the state.\n\n\u201cOsun State is number 6 from the bottom in the national allocation, but we are number 4 in terms of performance in the country. Oyetola deserves a second term in office.\u201d Alhaji Tella said.\n\nThe programmes witnessed Imaams and Alfas from across the Iwo land as well as royal fathers and politicians.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), has dragged the Federal Government of Nigeria before the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja over the failure of the government to rescue the kidnapped victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack.\n\nSERAP urged the regional court to declare that the train attack, abduction and killing of passengers by terrorist amounts to a failure by the government to protect Nigerians and to prevent the grave human rights violations.\n\nThe civil society organisation is also seeking an order directing the government to protect, promote, and fulfil the human rights of Nigerians, including travellers across the country, by ensuring adequate security and taking measures to prevent attacks.\n\nThe CSO further asked the court for an order directing the government to urgently find and identify all the passengers, victims and their families, and to pay adequate monetary compensation of N50million to each to the passengers and victims and their families.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the suit filed together with an application for expedited hearing, SERAP argued that, \u201cThe Buhari government has a legal duty to protect individuals from real and immediate risks to their lives and security caused by actions of third-parties such as terrorists.\n\n\u201cA fundamental notion of contemporary human rights law is that victims of violations such as the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack enjoy an independent right to effective remedies. Rights without remedies are ineffectual, rendering illusory the government\u2019s duty to protect such rights.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari government has failed to protect the constitutionally and internationally guaranteed rights of the victims of the train attack to life, dignity and security, and their right to an effective remedy.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari government is under a legal obligation to protect the life of every citizen in the country.\n\n\u201cRemedies logically should be proportionate to the gravity of the harm or violations caused by the government and its agents or by terrorists or unknown perpetrators.\n\n\u201cHuman life has a special value and dignity which requires legal protection. It is the principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation.\n\n\u201cThe officials of the Buhari government have publicly stated that they knew or had information that an attack on the train was imminent but the government failed and/or neglected to take measures to prevent the train attack.\n\n\u201cThe government will still be held accountable for failing or neglecting to guarantee and protect human rights regardless of whether such violations are directly or indirectly attributable to the government or its officials.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari government has an obligation to promote and protect the rights to life, security and dignity. This obligation means that the government must create an enabling environment that facilitates the enjoyment of these rights by the people.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the Buhari government to protect and guarantee the rights to life, security, liberty and dignity of the passengers and victims of the train attack violates the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari government and the Nigeria Railway Corporation had ignored several warnings in the past to take preventive measures to provide adequate security for the train services, and to suspend late rail services to prevent attack by terrorists and to ensure the security and safety of passengers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFew days before the train attack, some terrorists had gained control of and entered the Kaduna airport in a daring attack. The Buhari government failed or refused to take preventive measures to ensure adequate security in the airport and its surrounding, and to prevent the attack on the train.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the application for expedited hearing, and the substantive suit.",

We have been living at the mercy of God. Nothing is safe here. Not even the roofing sheets.\n\n\u201cThe church lost newly fixed roofing sheets worth millions of Naira. We have lost too many plastic chairs and seats worth hundreds of thousands of naira.\n\n\u201cThe last one that happened which shocked everyone was a very big goat which was used by a church member for thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cAnd the goat valued at about N150,000 was tied up in the church compound but was stolen the next day. Can you imagine the guts?\n\n\u201cWe discovered the thief pulled down some blocks while jumping into the church compound to do his thing.\n\n\u201cI am not happy about his death. I would have loved it if he was alive to repent, but this should be a lesson to others out there.\n\nHis corpse was discovered this morning (Sunday) and had been reported at the Central Police Station, Aba.\n\n\u201cIt is really a pity.

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has extolled the virtue of the Nigerian workers whom he said sacrificed their \u2018sweat and zeal\u2019 to nurture the nation from birth till date.\n\nHe spoke Sunday during this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day Rally themed \u2018Labour, Politics, and the Quest for Good Governance and Development\u2019 in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe labour movement is a foundational movement in the making of our nation. You are heirs of a movement that was involved in literally building modern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOver a century ago, the Nigerian working class laid the railway tracks and erected telegraph poles connecting the vast reaches of a country that was about to be born. Indeed, it is impossible to tell the story of our nation\u2019s liberation from colonial rule without dwelling at length on the heroic contributions of the labour movement to that struggle.\n\n\u201cThe struggle for fairness and equity in relations between the employer and the worker and the campaign for the dignity of the Nigerian worker in the colonial era were closely bound up with the quest for independence. Some would say that both struggles were two sides of the same coin. For just as the Nigerian worker sought to be accorded equal rights in his own land, the nationalist movement sought to break the yoke of colonialism and transform our people from subjects to citizens.\n\n\u201cIn this epic struggle, the Nigerian working class was the army of the nationalist movement. We remember the 1945 General Strike and the Iva Valley Massacre in 1949 in which striking miners seeking their rights were killed by colonial authorities.\n\n\u201cThese are watershed events in the evolution of our nation. Names such as those of Pa Michael Imoudu, Mallam Aminu Kano, Nduka Eze, F.O. Coker, E.E. Esua and M.A. Bankole among others are seared into the national memory \u2013 they belong to iconic figures in the labour movement who played critical roles in our quest for liberation from colonial rule.\n\n\u201cWhen we sing our National Anthem and proclaim that the \u201cthe labours of our heroes past shall never be in vain\u201d, we are invoking the memory of legions of patriotic agitators among whom were leading lights of the labour movement. Therefore, the Nigerian worker in every real sense laid the foundations of our sovereignty and freedom with their blood and tears and nurture it till this day with their sweat and zeal.\n\n\u201cSo the 1st of May is a day laden with historical significance and the importance of this occasion is further underscored by the fact that it is the last May Day celebration before a national election. In commemorating this event, there is much to reflect upon and the theme you have chosen for this occasion invites us to ponder on \u201cLabour, Politics and the Quest for Good Governance and Development.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

This personal philosophy has greatly influenced and channelled my thoughts and actions.\n\n\u201cMy vision and commitment in this endeavour is for the people. Beyond politics, it is my passion to feel and understand the pulse of the people \u2014our thoughts, expectations and understanding of the course set before us and the way forward.\n\n\u201cWe have endured governance that has for too long been less than capable of delivering its promises or meeting the desires of the people for basic development. We have groped in the dark for far too long. I am Nwanyi bu Ihe, ihe ga adi na Arochukwu-Ohafia Constituency come 2023.

          "text": "\u2026Gross profit hits N48.8bn, rising by 122.3%\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and the London Stock Exchange, announces its unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7bn from N10.6bn year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4bn from N1.7bn year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6bn from N57.9bn year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8bn from N20.1bn year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nIn its operations, Seplat Energy demonstrated a strong safety record, which extended to 26.1 million hours without LTI from operated assets (2.0 million hours in Q1 2022).\n\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis. The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\n\n\u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote has said on Wednesday that women entrepreneurs in the Nigerian oil and gas industry should break barriers by taking advantage of the $40m fund created specifically for them under the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund, NCI Fund.\n\nWabote spoke at the annual general meeting of the Oil and Gas Trainers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, OGTAN, held in Abuja with the theme \u201cDiversity & Inclusiveness in Human Capital development for the Energy Sector.\u201d\n\nNoting that that unavailability of funds was one of the key challenges that often hinder the participation of women in the oil and gas activities, the Executive Secretary stated that the Board had addressed the issue through the NCI Fund.\n\n\u201cTo provide a fair chance for women in the oil and gas industry, the Board partnered with the NEXIM Bank to establish a $20 million fund that was matched with an additional $20 million fund by NEXIM bank, making the total pool of funds available to women in oil and gas to be $40 million,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the Board and its partners have introduced and implemented several initiatives that promote diversity in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSome of those gender-focused interventions were being implemented in partnership with the Bank of Industry, BoI, while others were facilitated by the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, he added.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary, another step taken by the Board to drive diversity in oil and gas activities was the setting up of the Diversity Sectorial Group in the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Board has also organized events that were targeted at women and community activities to promote inclusiveness.\n\nHe mentioned that NCDMB\u2019s efforts to lead the womenfolk into the mainstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry was recognized at the 5th Nigerian International Energy Summit this year when the agency was bestowed with an award of the \u201cBest Gender Support Company in the Energy Space\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Human Capacity Development, the NCDMB boss explained that it adds significant value to the energy sector, and contributes to developing local content in the energy sector.\n\nHe also confirmed that the Board\u2019s Human Capacity Development model has no gender bias as it was inclusive and provides equal opportunities to all applicants and beneficiaries.\n\nHe hinted that NCDMB had put in place the 60-20-20 training model in which 60 percent of the training resources provided by the Board and the industry are devoted to providing young Nigerians with specialized skills they need to secure employment.\n\nHe stated that \u201cunder this component of the model, beneficiaries are provided with qualitative skills and international certifications that will position them for employment within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that 20 percent of the training spend was geared towards improvement in the productivity of already employed personnel while another 20 percent of spend on training is used for trainings on soft skills.\n\nThe Executive Secretary assured that the Board will continue to develop female members of staff to occupy key positions in preparation for higher leadership roles as well as continue to promote Human Capacity Development across various spheres of the energy sector, including skill development and entrepreneurship programs and STEM development across secondary and tertiary institutions to prepare youths for the future.",

Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings order, which he obtained under questionable circumstances.\n\nRecall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation owe the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried all reasonable and peaceful resolution strategies to recover the debt from Jimoh Ibrahim to no avail.\n\nAs a responsible debt recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, AMCON approached the Federal High Court (FHC) in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 to seek justice, and accordingly received an order of the trial court to take over the businesses of Jimoh Ibrahim. AMCON further received the backing of the trial court to appoint a Receiver/Manager to oversee the businesses on behalf of AMCON.\n\nFollowing the trial court\u2019s ruling, Jimoh Ibrahim, claimed that he was directed by the court on March 9, 2022, to commence contempt proceedings against the Executive Management of AMCON, which led AMCON to challenge the said ruling by filling Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeal on March 14, 2022.\n\nThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the outstanding N69.4billion debt owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.",

The study is expected to be concluded between April and July, 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the NCC\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 forum recently organised in Lagos on the commencement of the study, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economy Analysis, PCEA, at NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, who represented the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the forum was hosted to intimate operators in the CIS segment of the telecom market on the study and to secure their buy-in and cooperation with the consultants undertaking the study.\n\nAkinloye reasoned that, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services, the NCC periodically conducts studies to assess the level of competition in the industry.\n\n\u201cHaving successfully conducted competition assessment studies in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the Commission had issued determinations based on the findings of the studies while outcome of such studies has also enabled the Commission to come up with various regulatory interventions and initiatives to continuously provide a level-playing field for the interplay of market forces. These procedures are emplaced by the Commission to ensure fair, efficient and sustainable competition in the Nigerian telecom industry.\u201d\n\nDespite the measurable progress made by the Commission, Akinloye stated that, since the successful completion of the 2013 study, there had been significant development and activities in some market segments of the industry that had necessitated the conduct of another competition study.\n\nFor instance, at the time the 2013 study was conducted, the CIS market segment was still at embryonic stage and as such, much emphasis was not placed on it. However, \u201cThe CIS segment has recorded significant growth and transformation over the years having about 80 licensees, operating in the segment while its performance and activities continue to impact significantly on other segments of the Nigerian industry. The Director PCEA also informed that activities in the CIS market have also attained the targets set out in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025)\u201d.\n\nAkinloye further declared that the overarching objective of the study is to provide current insights into the level of competition in the CIS market segment and articulate strategies to enhance opportunities in the market, as well as ensure the deepening of competition which will ultimately support the provision of innovative services for the benefits of both market players and the consumers at large.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with NCC\u2019s participatory approach to regulation, this initial stakeholders forum has been convened to formally introduce the project and the appointed consultants to the industry\u201d. Akinloye informed participants and asserted that the forum provides opportunities for stakeholders to gain an understanding into the objective, scope and methodology of the study, as well as to ensure that questionnaire or Request for Information (RFI) developed by the consultants to access the level of competition in the market are well understood.\n\nThus, Akinloye rallied the stakeholders to see the forum as an opportunity \u201cto seek and receive clarification based on presentation delivered by the consultant and to make comments on issues relating to the study. She urged all participants to \u201ccommit to the objectives of the study, by providing complete, timely feedback to questionnaires.\u201d\n\nDirector, Technical Standards and Network Integrity at NCC, Bako Wakil, also joined Akinloye in seeking the full cooperation of licensees in the CIS segment of the telecom market whenever they are approached by the consultants for relevant information either through the instrumentality of the RFI or through one-on-one sessions with consultants in the course of the implementation of the study.\n\nAccording to Wakil, the study is in the interest of the CIS licensees, other players and the consumers. It will also provide the Commission with useful and evidenced-based insights necessary to ensure healthy competition and a level-playing ground in the CIS segment and ensure sustainability in the growth of the telecommunication industry.\n\n\u201cAlso, rest assured of the confidentiality of any information provided to the Commission in the course of this study, no matter how sensitive,\u201d Bako said to the enthusiastic audience.\n\nEarlier in her presentation to telecom stakeholders at the event, Partner at PwC, Mary Iwelumo, amplified the voice of the Commission on the objectives of the study and urged them to cooperate with the firm in providing accurate, timely and adequate responses to the RFI or the questionnaire that would be administered. This will ensure that appropriate information are to obtained to address the challenges in the sector.",

S. A, where workers led a protest to insist on working for eight hours instead of the 12 hours a day, besides other welfare issues.\n\nHere in Nigeria, led by the labour unions, workers are holding rallies across the country to mark the event and advocate for better welfare.\n\nAnd following a pre-May day rally by the Nigeria Labour Congress, a major focus of this year\u2019s celebration will centre around a call on Nigerian workers to get their PVCs and make their voices and votes count ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nRead Also: [Labour Day] Lawan Seeks \u2018Speedy\u2019 End To ASUU Strike\n\nWhat Leaders Are Saying:\n\nNASS\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan has assured workers that the National Assembly will continue to partner with the Organised Labour to address issues relating to them.\n\nHe made gave the assurance in a statement celebrating Nigerian workers on the occasion of this year\u2019s May Day, while calling for a speedy and amicable resolution to the months-old Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers deserve our appreciation and respect for their contributions to the development of our country,\u201d Lawan said.\n\n\u201cI also salute them for their patriotic cooperation with the government and other institutions in the collective efforts to address societal challenges.\u201d\n\nTinubu\n\nChieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, also charged Nigerians to work in harmony to produce a better country for themselves and future generations.\n\n\u201cLabour is the backbone of a nation. Our nation\u2019s labourers are the daily unsung heroes of society. The work they performed helps define our nation. The goods and services their efforts provide are the basis of our collective well-being, he said.\n\n\u201cToday is Workers\u2019 Day. It is a day for us to fully celebrate the Nigerian worker\u201d.\n\nGovernors\n\nState governors have also joined in celebrating workers.\n\nBabajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State urged workers in the state to remain productive and committed to carrying out their duties, while his Edo State counterpart Godwin Obaseki, assured workers in the state that his administration will continue to prioritise their welfare.\n\nIn Ogun State, Governor Dapo Abiodun joined workers to commemorate the day at the Moshood Abiola stadium in the state capital where a match past was held.\n\nAddressing the state workers at the occasion, Governor Abiodun appreciated them for their loyalty, professionalism and perseverance in the face of the global socio-economic challenges.\n\nThe governor, however, seized the auspicious occasion to promise better years ahead as he promised to settle all outstanding deductions, gratuities and other welfare packages.\n\nIn the north, the Kaduna State Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by Ayuba Suleiman, has lamented that the productivity and safety of workers in the state have been largely affected by banditry and terrorism.\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the Federal Government to rise up to its responsibility of protecting the lives and property of citizens.\n\nGombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya in a goodwill message, described workers as partners in progress, assuring that his administration will continue to sustain and deepen the existing friendly working environment and industrial harmony in the state.",

It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend that we do not know that our workers are suffering,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000 a month. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\n\n\u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government.\n\n\u201cBut as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nWhile reassuring his government\u2019s relentless support to senior citizens in the state, Obaseki lamented the hardship experienced by pensioners and other senior citizens because of the rising cost of food and other items.\n\n\u201cI am particularly interested in our senior citizens because they are one of the most vulnerable in our society. We took interest in payments of outstanding pensions to our pensioners although these pensions were held by the previous administration.\n\n\u201cIn view of the prevailing economic circumstances, I have now approved, effective this May, the agreement we reached with the Union of Pensioners that the harmonized amount would be paid from May 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by the pensioners due to the non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge, and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges,\u201d the governor added.\n\nObaseki however urged workers in the state to take advantage of opportunities offered by his administration in the agricultural sector to increase food production in the country.\n\nEarlier in his address, the state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye, charged the Federal Government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment, and hunger in the country.",

The final victory is within sight. Boko Haram and its offshoots\u2019 final embers are now fading.\n\n\u201cLast month, the leader of ISWAP was killed in an airstrike. Since the New Year, thousands of fighters have surrendered to enter rehabilitation programmes. The territories they used to occupy are now seeing the return of those who were forced to flee their barbarity. Normality is finally beginning to return to the Northeast. It is a long process. Yet it is one we are, together, now embarking upon.\u201d\n\nOn crude oil theft and illegal bunkering in the South-South region, the President said his administration is equally getting impressive reports of the special operations to curb the menace.\n\nOne of such commendable reports is the impounding of millions of illegally refined products with several illegal refineries being destroyed.\n\nHe also gave the approval for the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta, Imo State to tackle the security challenges in the South-East zone.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile we are making progress cleaning the environment, some evil people are busy causing more pollution and destruction.\n\n\u2018\u2018In response to the disturbing rise in criminal attacks targeting law enforcement and public facilities in the South-East, concerted military operations to rid the region of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN) elements have, in recent weeks, led to the overrunning of IPOB/ESN bases, the seizure of weapons and the arrest of a large number of suspects.\n\n\u201cThe reinvigoration of the war against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking is also showing positive results as shown by the arrest of over 12, 300 offenders including seven drug barons: the conviction of 1,400, counseling and rehabilitation of about 8,000 drug users.\n\n\u201cThe seizure of over 3.4 million kilograms of drugs and cash worth over N130 billion, all in 2021 has been recorded while the first Quarter of this year has seen the arrest of no fewer than 3,536 offenders including security personnel and a well-known billionaire drug baron. The seizure of more than 65,000 tons of assorted drugs in this period sets a record for the nation.\u201d\n\nOn the efforts made to boost the personnel of security operatives, President Buhari granted approvals for the promotion of more than 3,500 officers, the procurement of operational equipment, and training for personnel, and buildings for residential barracks.\n\nThis is even as he directed increased coordination and cooperation among security agencies, saying that an end has been brought to a silo approach among the agencies, assuring that there will be no shortage of funds to provide security for the citizens.",

          "text": "The leader of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, on Saturday, led thousands of South East youths in a solidarity march in support of the candidacy of the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe youths, who started the procession from the MASSOB leader\u2019s House in Owerri, marched through the streets, carrying different placards, with inscriptions such as \u201cPower to the Youths, Support Yahaya Bello\u201d, \u201cYouths Can Also Lead\u201d, and \u201cYahaya Bello for the Youths\u201d, among others.\n\nThey made it clear that the only solution to Nigeria\u2019s political quagmire was for power to go to the youths.\n\nAccording to them, in this regard, Governor Bello is the right fit for the position of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nRecall that Bello picked his Expression of Interest and Nomination forms at the All Progressives Congress national secretarial on Wednesday.\n\nBello, who was the first to pay the N100million required for the forms, was received by a mammoth crowd of party faithful and support groups from across the country, who have been urging him to run for President.\n\nChief Uwazuruike, who advised Nigerians and party leaders to shun zoning, saying it had no place in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, said his MASSOB/BIM would support Governor Bello to become the next president of Nigeria because he had the leadership qualities to lead Nigeria effectively.\n\nHe noted that power should go to the best in the race, adding that the Kogi State Governor was the best for the job.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians should rally round the youthful Governor, Yahaya Bello. Today, April 30, 2022 is all about Nigerian youths. We are supporting Yahaya Bello for this and no one else. That he has the capacity to solve the problem of insecurity and a host of others facing the nation is not in doubt.\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of the country. We must give youths a chance, especially one that has demonstrated uncommon capacity, in the person of Yahaya Bello,\u201d he said.\n\nUwazuruike, who is also the Founder of Biafran Independent Movement, said that he does not believe in a president of Igbo extraction, insisting that the contest should be thrown open.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd that had come to welcome him at the APC Secretariat last Wednesday, Bello had said, \u201cRight now, what we have ahead of us is a task of canvassing and consulting all party faithfuls, leaders, delegates and stalwarts, members and all Nigerians, at home and even in the diaspora to support us so that we become the flagbearer of this great party come 30 and 31 of May 2022. And by the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Member of the Federal House of Representatives, Dr. Dakuku Adol Peterside, has issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for the immediate and unconditional release of the Member representing Bonny/Degema Federal Constituency, Hon. Doctor Farah Dagogo, from detention.Peterside, who said Hon. Dagogo\u2019s arrest has no locus standi in any known Nigerian Law or Statue, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act, described Wike as a neo-fascist and dictator desperate to gag free speech and democratic rights of Rivers citizens.\n\nHe challenged the governor to justify his reasons for the arrest of the lawmaker other than his quest to remain a political alpha and omega who would not brood any fair contest. While insisting that the police also erred in executing the arrest without a known court warrant of arrest, Peterside vowed that Rivers State would not allow Wike to prosper in his quest to turn the state into an Italy of Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism held sway until the world rallied democracy against them. \u201cRivers State cannot become an Italy of Benito Mussolini, or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism and dictatorship contracted an evil marriage of convenience that bestrode and muzzled free speech and fundamental rights of citizens. What Wike is working at is to annex every independent mind and cow every Rivers citizen into sheepish acquiescence. But what he plays ignorant of is that from the times of Dappa Biriye, Melford Okilo, Obi Wali, TImothy Birabi, all nationalists and Democrats, Rivers had never suffered fools to muzzle them. So, we shall keep to that historic attitude and would never surrender to Wike and his goons.\u201d\n\nPeterside, who is the immediate past Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, queried Gov. Wike on how he obtained evidence linking the lawmaker to an alleged disruption of proceedings at the Rivers State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. \u201cWike had lied at several times such that these days his claims must be subjected to forensic investigation before believed. So, Rivers people need know how he proved Dagogo\u2019s link to whatever happened at their party Secretariat\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile calling on lovers of democracy and free speech to condemn Wike and his fascist style of governance, Peterside reiterated his 48-hour ultimatum to Gov. Wike to order the release of the detailed lawmaker. \u201cWike has 48 hours to ensure that Honourable Farah is set free and allowed to continue to pursue his political aspiration. Nothing short of that shall avail. Wike cannot be junketing in pursuit of his presidential ambition using Rivers State resources while wickedly gagging another\u2019s on the altar of ego. He must let Dagogo go\u201d, , Peterside averted.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Jonathan\u2019s Rumoured Ambition Poses No Threat, Say Osinbajo, Tinubu\u2019s Support Groups",
          "text": "The support groups of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu have declared that the rumoured presidential ambition of former President Goodluck Jonathan on the platform of the APC poses no threat to their principals.\n\nJonathan had recently revealed that he was still considering the call on him to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHowever, the support groups of the various presidential aspirants contesting on the platform of APC have insisted that the purported entrants of Jonathan into the race would not scuttle the chances of their principals ahead of the presidential primary of the party slated for May 30 and June 1, 2022.\n\nReacting, the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) said that it remained unperturbed about the speculation that Jonathan would contest on the platform of APC.\n\nTSG Head of Media, Mr. Tosin Adeyanju noted that Tinubu was already focused on the presidential primary and has been reaching out to delegates.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe more the merrier. We welcome everyone to the race. Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu is a democrat that believes in a democratic context. We are focused on the primaries, which is what the party constitution stipulates. We are equally reaching out to all delegates coming for the primaries.\n\n\u201cOther aspirants before him have equally dropped the president\u2019s name as the anointed one. \u201cTherefore, he will not be the last to say so moving towards primaries. The party must choose the most popular aspirant at the primaries in other for APC to be able to win the general election and our principal fit into this.\n\nAdeyanju thought that the purported coming of Jonathan to APC would not jeopardise the chances of the former Governor of Lagos state.\n\nHe added: \u201cHe will not (scuttle Tinubu\u2019s chances) because he would have to submit his credentials and records to the party delegates for scrutiny. Asiwaju\u2019s record speaks for him and that is why he is running on his record and his democratic credentials.\u201d\n\nAlso, Osinbajo Support Movement, said it has no reason to be jittery over the purported coming of Jonathan.\n\nThe Convener, Mr. Badmus Olawale, said the law signed by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018 forbids Jonathan from contesting in 2023.\n\nThe Act intends to ensure that where a Vice President succeeds that president and where a deputy governor succeeds a governor, he can no more contest for that office more than once more.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have no reason to (be jittery). First, the law signed by Mr. President about a sitting Vice President completing the tenure of his/her principal has stipulated that such a person can only contest once more \u2013 which means he cannot swear an oath for the office of the President more than twice. GEJ has completed the tenure of late Umar Yar\u2019Adua and he has equally contested on his own and won in 2011.\u201d\n\nOn the speculation that Jonathan might be anointed by Buhari, Olawale insisted that every aspirant contesting on the platform of APC needs the blessings of the President, adding that Jonathan is not a member of the APC.\n\nHe noted that it was laughable to abhor the thought that Jonathan\u2019s entrants into the race would scuttle Osinbajo\u2019s chances.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt will be laughable to even think such. How do we market him to the delegates, party members, and Nigerians in general despite our campaigns against him in 2015? Is the APC going to say, oh! we are sorry it was an error removing Jonathan and we want to bring him back?\u201d\n\nOn her part, the Head of Media, Governor Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, Ms. Yemi Kolapo said the former President was welcomed to the race just like other aspirants.\n\nShe added that regardless of the number of people that showed interest, Bello would be on the ballot.\n\nKolapo said: \u201cJonathan is welcome to APC just like others. The space is enough for all to fly. However, regardless of the number of people who show interest in the APC presidential ticket, Governor Yahaya Bello will be on the ballot.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the Personal Assistant/ Head of Media to the former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, Dr. Ebere Nzewuji said Okorocha stands out among all the aspirants given the mood of the nation now and his antecedents.\n\nHe said the ruling party knows Okorocha\u2019s credentials, adding that it doesn\u2019t matter if former President Jonathan joins the race.\n\nNzewuji noted that while the nation was threatened by people agitating for separation, insecurity, and a dwindling economy, Okorocha has his signature in all the nooks and crannies of the nation.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "OPEC Signs Deal to Fund Feasibility Study of $25bn Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline",
          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund has announced that it will contribute $14.3 million to Phase II of the feasibility study for the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline estimated at $25 billion.\n\nThis is coming as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has offset its cash call debts to International Oil Companies (IOCs) to the tune of $3.717 billion in the last six years, a new report by the national oil company has indicated.\n\nHowever, as the NNPC is reducing the debts owed the IOCs, rising petrol subsidy claims incurred by the company have continued to take tolls on the economy with analysts projecting that it will raise Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit to N10 trillion at the end of the year.\n\nTo be directly financed by the OPEC Fund for International Development (IFID), the intervention, OPEC said, is meant to support the Moroccan government\u2019s national development strategy aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon energy system.\n\nAccording to OPEC, it will further diversify the country\u2019s energy mix and help it in achieving its renewable energy commitments.\n\nThe study will carry out detailed evaluations of the implementation and design process for the eventual construction of the gas pipeline, thus facilitating the final investment decision.\n\nOPEC Fund\u2019s contribution, the organisation added, will specifically co-finance the survey works for the North Area (Senegal \u2013 Mauritania \u2013 Morocco) of the NMGP.\n\nMorocco and the OPEC Fund signed an agreement at the weekend to jointly fund the feasibility study ahead of the construction of the world\u2019s longest offshore pipeline connecting Nigeria to Morocco.\n\nThe gas pipeline project would cover 7,000 kilometres through 13 West African countries, and extend to Europe, according to Worley, the company handling the current phase of the project.\n\nIt was further learnt that the London team of the Australian energy firm will deliver the onshore part of the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study, including the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and Land Acquisition Studies (LAS), on the proposed pipeline from Nigeria to Morocco.\n\nMorocco\u2019s Economy and Finance Minister, Nadia Fettah, signed the agreement alongside the Director-General of the OPEC Fund, Abdulhamid Al khalifa, and Managing Director of Morocco\u2019s National Office for Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONYHM), Amina Benkhadra.\n\nCo-financed with the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the study comprises a body of research on the execution of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline, including the technical, financial, and legal aspects, a statement after the event indicated.\n\nLaunched through a joint initiative in 2017, the pipeline is set to boost local economies\u2019 competitiveness by providing secure access to an energy source and aims to deliver gas from Nigeria to Europe as well as supply countries along the way. In December 2021, Morocco and Nigeria signed an agreement to fund the FEED after the project was approved by the IDB. Morocco and Nigeria agreed to provide joint funding for the mega project. The FEED study is projected to cost $90.1 million in total.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in 2021, held a phone call with Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI, where the Nigerian leader expressed his country\u2019s determination to bring the pipeline online as soon as possible, according to a report by Morocco World News.\n\nBased on the 25-year estimate given in 2017, the construction of the $25 billion projects is expected to be completed by 2046.\n\nThe pipeline would connect Nigerian gas to every coastal country in West Africa (Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania), ending at Tangiers, Morocco, and C\u00e1diz, Spain.\n\nNNPC Slashes Cash Call Arrears by $3.717bn in Six Years\n\nMeanwhile, NNPC Limited has offset its cash call debts to the IOCs to the tune of $3.717 billion in the last six years, a new report by the national oil company has indicated.\n\nData from the NNPC showed that $3.717 billion has been paid in the last six years out of the $4.689 billion debts owed to the five joint venture partners.\n\nOut of the $3.717 billion paid during the period under review, about $40 million was paid in March 2022, leaving a balance of $971,817,730.\n\nIn its presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) in April, the NNPC indicated that it has reduced the 2016 renegotiated debt to less than $1 billion.\n\nThe five oil majors initially owed by the national oil company were: Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Mobil Producing, Nigeria, Chevron Nigeria Limited, Total Exploration as well as Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC). However, the debts owed Mobil and Chevron have been fully paid by the NNPC\n\nMobil and Chevron had a renegotiated debt of $833.751 million and $1.097 billion respectively. Shell\u2019s initial $1.372 billion has been reduced to $595.1 million.\n\nSimilarly, Total\u2019s $610.9 million has been reduced to $152.06 million, while NAOC has a balance of $224 million from the initial $774.66 million in 2016.\n\nCash calls are requests sent by JV operators to non-operating partners for payment in the light of anticipated future capital, operating expenditures or as additional capital contributions.\n\nThe NNPC had in 2016, signed a cash call repayment agreement with its JV partners to defray cash-call arrears within five years after many years of its indebtedness to its partners.\n\nBefore then, it had consistently for years failed to meet its indebtedness to the IOCs, a situation the operators said caused a loss of new investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nPetrol Subsidy Payments to Raise Fiscal Deficit to N10tn in 2022\n\nIn another development, rising petrol subsidy claims incurred by the NNPC have continued to take tolls on the economy with analysts projecting that it will raise Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit to N10 trillion at the end of the year.\n\nThe development, according to economic analysts from Afrinvest Securities Limited, will weigh heavily on Nigeria\u2019s growing debt profile with a correspondent fall in capital expenditure.\n\nIn the April edition of the Afrinvest Monthly Market Report, which was released on Saturday, analysts from the research firm noted that a revised expenditure plan passed by the National Assembly in April brought about a 702.0 per cent surge in the provision for petrol subsidy payment for 2022 to N3.6 trillion.\n\nThis, the report said, followed the 18 months postponement of the implementation period of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, which ought to have ended the subsidy regime by February 2022.\n\nAccording to the report, the revised expenditure plan showed that the federal government\u2019s revenue projection for 2022 was lowered by N772.9billion to N9.97trillion, thus expanding the estimated fiscal deficit for the year by 15.1 per cent to N7.4trillion.\n\nThe report, however, maintained that given its weak optimism about the likely improvement in revenue from oil and gas, and the independent revenue from other sources, the actual deficit for 2022 will be in the threshold of N10trillion.\n\nThe report stated: \u201cFirst, on the domestic scene, the National Assembly in April passed the revised N17.3trillion expenditure plan for the executive in 2022, which translates to an increase of N192.5 billion over the amount earlier passed in December 2021.\n\n\u201cThe revised expenditure plan saw non-debt recurrent expenditure and debt service provisions rise by 2.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively to N7.1trillion and N4 trillion, while provisions for statutory transfers and capital expenditure were lowered by 6 per cent and 1 per cent to N800 million and N5.4 trillion respectively. The increase in the non-debt expenditure was largely due to the 702.0 per cent surge in provision for petrol subsidy payment for 2022 to N3.6 trillion, following the 18 months postponement of the implementation period of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, which ought to have ended the subsidy regime by February 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report said the increase in debt service provision is to cushion the knock-on effect of the rising interest rate environment in the external and domestic debt market amid rising inflationary pressure.\n\nIt noted however that \u201cSadly, the federal government\u2019s revenue projection for 2022 was lowered by N772.9 billion to N9.97 trillion, hence, expanding the estimated fiscal deficit for the year by 15.1 per cent to N7.4 trillion.\u201d\n\nThe report maintained that \u201cGiven our weak optimism about the likely improvement in revenue from oil and gas, independent revenue, and revenue from other sources as earlier captured in our January 2022 macroeconomic outlook report (A Mix of a Boom & Gloom), we maintain that actual deficit for 2022 may top N10 trillion.\u201d\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
