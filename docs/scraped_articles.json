          "text": "No fewer than 20 people were killed while seven others sustained varying degrees of injuries in multiple crashes that occurred on Sunday evening.\n\nThe Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corp, Bauchi State, Yusuf Abdullahi, confirmed the crashes to our correspondent late Sunday night.\n\nHe said the first crash which involved two vehicles occurred at about 7pm at Bambal Village along Kano-Jama\u2019are highway.\n\nHe added that one of the vehicles, an 18-seater Toyota Hummer bus, collided with a trailer with number plate, MAD710XA, and immediately went up in flames.\n\nAbdullahi said the crash which had 10 male adults and six female adults was caused by speed violation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere were 16 people involved in this crash comprising 10 male adults and six female adults. The crash was caused by speed violation.\n\n\u201cThe hummer bus rammed into a moving trailer and it went into flames, killing all the occupants on board. The corpses were taken and deposited at the General Hospital Kiyawa.\n\n\u201cIn fact, all the 16 passengers were burnt beyond recognition. It is sad.\u201d\n\nHe said the second crash happened at 6.30pm at Duhuwar Kura village, along Azare-Zaki road, killing four passengers and injuring seven others.\n\nHe added that the crash also involved a Volkswagen Golf car driven by one Abubakar Haruna and a Bajaj Boxer motorcycle.\n\nAccording to him, the crash was also caused by speed violation and overloading.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere were 11 people involved in the crash comprising of nine male adults, one female adult and one female child.\n\n\u201cAfter the crash, the victims were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Azare, for confirmation and treatment, where a medical doctor confirmed four male adults dead.\n\n\u201cThose injured included five male adults, one female adult and one female child.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi lamented the frequent crashes along routes across the state.\n\nHe called on drivers to avoid overloading and observe road traffic rules and regulations in order to minimise loss of lives and properties.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Senate President, Ahmad Lawan\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nABUJA-THE President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan has described the current 9th National Assembly as the most successful in law making since the return to civil rule in 1999.\n\nAccording to Lawan, the focus of the ninth National Assembly had been on legislations that are most likely to impact either on the democratic Institutions, economy, security or the livelihood of Nigerians.\n\nREAD ALSO:Bandit attack on pinau village in Plateau unwarranted-Reps\u2019 deputy speaker\n\nThe President of the Senate spoke yesterday in Abuja as a guest lecturer at the first Distinguished Parliamentarians\u2019 Lecture Series which was facilitated by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies.\n\nHe spoke on \u201cThe Legislature, Legislative Mandate and the People \u2013 The Reality and the Public Perception.\u201d\n\nLawan said, \u201cI dear say that the ninth Assembly has been the most successful in the area of lawmaking since 1999.\n\n\u201cWe have broken many \u2018jinxes\u2019 and done many \u2018firsts,\u2019 overcoming traditional obstacles through consensus building and clever political brinkmanship.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate who noted that as of November 2021, about 2,500 Bills had been introduced in the National Assembly \u2013 769 in the Senate and 1,634 in the House of Representatives, said, \u201cHowever, as I have repeatedly maintained, for us in the 9th Assembly it is not so much the number of bills as it is quality.\n\n\u201cWe have focused our energy working on legislations that have a realistic chance of being assented to as well as those that have the potential to impact most on the lives of Nigerians \u201c\n\nAccording to him, the President Muhammadu Buhari led-APC had been the most proficient in granting assent to Bills stressing that available data on gazetted Acts showed that between 2015 and 2021, President Buhari had assented to more than 84 Bills, the highest since 1999.\n\nThe President of the Senate said that the projection was that the figure would be significantly higher before the end of Buhari tenure in 2023.\n\nFrom the available data displayed by the Senate President, President Olusegun Obasanjo signed a total of 82 billed into law between 1999 and 2006, President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua signed 38 bills into law between 2007 and 2009 while President Goodluck Jonathan signed 40 bills into law between 2010 and 2915.\n\nLawan said, \u201cFor twenty years, the National Assembly had attempted reforming the petroleum industry without much success.\n\n\u201cIt was first introduced in the 6th Assembly (2007-2011) but failed to scale through. Similar efforts by the 7th Assembly failed to secure concurrence by the Senate while in the 8th Assembly, the Bill was passed but failed to secure presidential assent.\n\n\u201cIn the 9th Assembly, we prioritised the Bill in our legislative agenda and worked closely with the Executive to secure passage and assent.\n\n\u201cThis historic achievement of the National Assembly means that Nigeria now has legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal frameworks for the petroleum industry that would promote optimal utilisation of the country\u2019s abundant oil and gas resources.\n\n\u201cIt will also enhance social and economic development and promote a conducive investment climate in the industry and foster the development of host communities.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding immodest, we have equally concluded work on several other important pieces of legislations that have been signed into law, all of which have the potential to significantly enhance various aspects of our national life.\n\n\u201cThe Finance Act (2020) successfully amended 17 key aspects of the extant laws including seven existing tax laws.\n\n\u201cThe CAMA 2020 Act, also represents a landmark achievement representing the first time in thirty years that this law has been updated.\n\n\u201cThe Act introduces measures to ensure efficiency in the registration and regulation of corporate vehicles, reduce the compliance burden of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), enhance transparency and stakeholders\u2019 engagement in corporate vehicles and, overall, promote a more friendly business climate.\n\n\u201cThe Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract (Amendment) Act 2019, which we passed and was assented to by the President gives effect to fiscal incentives given to Oil and Gas companies operating in the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin areas under production sharing contracts between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) or other companies holding oil prospecting licences (OPL) or oil mining leases (OML) and various petroleum exploration and production companies.\n\n\u201cThis will significantly increase Nigeria\u2019s earnings from oil wells located deep offshore and give it a fair and equitable share of income derived from its natural resources.\n\n\u201cOther Bills of great economic significance that have been passed by the National Assembly and awaiting Presidential Assent include the Public Procurement Act 2007 (Amendment) Bill, Recovery of Public Property Bill and the Amendment of Assets Management Corporation Act, among others.\n\n\u201cOnly a few weeks ago, we concluded work on the Electoral Act (2010) Amendment Bill. Once operational, the law will strengthen our electoral process and further reinforce public confidence in democratic institutions, especially the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cThe controversy generated by the Bill points to the ever-increasing maturity of our democracy and also amply demonstrated that the National Assembly is the people\u2019s Assembly and will always listen to the voice of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe 9th Assembly has also successfully pushed for a return to the January to December budget cycle. This was made possible by a successful collaboration between the President and members of the executive who have, since 2019, ensured early preparation and presentation of the budget.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the Bills targeting the economy already discussed above, this Assembly took on the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and adopted legislative measures to cushion the effect of the pandemic on Nigerians, mitigate its consequences, limit its spread and improve the efficiency of our health system to cope with the unprecedented challenges occasioned by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe gave expeditious consideration and passage for the Revised 2020 budget to tackle COVID and only recently approved the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP).\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is working to consider the 2022 Budget Appropriation Bill within this legislative week.\u201d",

This would be dealt with by human beings and not spirits.\u201d\n\nIn addressing the challenges, the Vice President mentioned that \u201cour creativity and innovation must be first and foremost to remove the obstacles, that is what will solve Nigeria\u2019s problems, implementation of the grand policies that we have and it depends on us.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also spoke about how it has taken some young Nigerians three years to get registration numbers for their businesses. He said he was told that in some other close African nations, the same registration takes six weeks.\n\nHe said for example \u201cif you get food and drugs administration registration anywhere else, you can be in a Nigerian supermarket\u2026 and they come and compete with our own people here. This is happening in every respect, even with exports.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Amb. Mariam Katagun expressed her appreciation to the Vice President for his leadership role, and also praised the stakeholders and State governors for their collaboration and cooperation in holding MSME Clinics.\n\nPresent at the meeting were the Managing Director of Bank of Industry, Mr Olukayode Pitan; Executive Director of Nigerian Export Promotion Council, Dr Ezra Yakusak; Director-General of SMEDAN, Dr Dikko Umaru Radda; Managing Director of NEXIM Bank, Mr Abba Bello; Managing Director of Development Bank of Nigeria, Mr Tony Okpanachi; Director-General of Standards Organisation of Nigeria, Mallam Farouk Salim; Managing Director of Bank of Agriculture, Mr Alwan Ali Hassan.

          "text": "The Civil Society Organisation (CSO) in Akwa Ibom State has alleged that over 65 per cent of contracts awarded by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in the state in the last five years are fake and non-existent.\n\nAddressing a news conference in Uyo yesterday to mark the International Anti- Corruption Day 2021 with the theme: \u201cYour right , your role: Say no to corruption\u201d, the CSO Chairman in Akwa Ibom, Mr. Harry Udoh, said the NDDC had lost more than N6trillion to corruption since it was established.\n\nHe listed non-existent of such projects in Akwa Ibom to include fake water project at Okosi community in Okobo Local Government, non-existent perimeter fencing at Model School, Ikot Oboroenyin village in Ikot Abasi Council Area and another road project at Urue Offong in Oruko Local Government.\n\nUdoh said that the fake projects were discovered when the CSO decided to track down the commission\u2019s projects in the 2019 budget.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said it was a shocking revelation at Okosi community where the NDDC claimed that it had completed water project for the people, but the people were found grappling with perennial water problem.\n\n\u201cWe are just coming from an independent tracking of 2019 approved budgeted projects and programmes of the commission in Akwa Ibom State. It may interest you to note that of the 31 projects captured in the 2019 approved budget and tracked by us, about 65 per cent of them are non-existent.\n\n\u201cThey could not be located. Community members were not aware of such projects in their communities; and were actually shocked to learn that there was an approved project by the NDDC for their communities.\n\n\u201cOf the projects actually implemented, over 85 per cent of them were shoddy jobs. We saw asphalt coating that was less than an inch and there were several failed portions already.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn instances, the project description as captured in the 2019 budget was different from what we saw on the ground. For instance, at Ikot Oborenyen in Ikot Abasi, the projection description in the budget read perimeter fencing of a model primary school, but what we found was a drain constructed around an open space with no building whatsoever on it and with no sign that construction work is about to begin, \u201c Udoh said.\n\nHe alleged that the funds had been siphoned through uncompleted projects dotting the landscape of the state.\n\n\u201cAgain, huge amount of critical fund has been spent with not much to show for it. How long would we continue to allow the colossal wastage? Let\u2019s stop the corruption in NDDC now,\u201d Udoh said.",

          "text": "COVID-19 was not created to depopulate Africa, says Buhari\n\nBy Bolaji Ogundele, Frank Ikpefan, Moses Emorinken, Abuja, Segun Showunmi, Ibadan, and Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians to disregard conspiracy theories claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by foreign countries to depopulate Africa or to make money for Western pharmaceutical companies.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the warning in his \u2018get well soon\u2019 message to the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, who was recently diagnosed with the COVID-19 infection.\n\nIn a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the President also warned that refusing to heed non-pharmaceutical instructions on staying safe from the virus is capable of setting government\u2019s efforts at containing its spread back.\n\nThe President, therefore, advised Nigerians to come out fully and get vaccinated.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn the statement, he reminded Nigerians \u201cto disregard the allegation that the pandemic is a foreign creation to depopulate Africa and boost the financial interests of western pharmaceutical companies through vaccine production\u201d.\n\n\u201cLack of attention to medical advice and apathy are damaging to the government\u2019s efforts to contain the spread of this deadly viral disease,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his message to President Ramaphosa, Buhari said: \u201cMy heart and prayers are with Mr. Ramaphosa of South Africa at this difficult moment of health challenge, and I pray for his speedy and full recovery.\n\n\u201cMr. Ramaphosa is a friend of Nigeria and an important partner in our joint continental efforts to tackle Africa\u2019s social, economic and political difficulties. \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic is a reality and no respecter of persons.\u201d\n\nSouth African President Ramaphosa tests positive\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and is receiving treatment for mild symptoms, the presidency said in a statement.\n\nRamaphosa, who is fully vaccinated, began feeling unwell after leaving a state memorial service for former deputy president F W de Klerk in Cape Town earlier in the day, but was in good spirits and being monitored by doctors, it said.\n\nHe would remain in self-isolation in Cape Town for the time being and had delegated responsibilities to Deputy President David Mabuza for the next week.\n\nOn a recent visit to four West African states, the president and the entire South African delegation were tested for COVID-19 in all countries, the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe president and the delegation returned to South Africa from the Republic of Senegal last Wednesday, after obtaining negative test results.\n\n\u201cThe president also tested negative on his return to Johannesburg on December 8.\u201d\n\nThe statement quoted Ramaphosa as saying that his own infection served as a warning to all citizens of the importance of getting vaccinated and remaining vigilant against exposure.\n\nNYSC: no COVID-19 vaccine card, no orientation next year\n\nTheNational Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has made the presentation of COVID-19 vaccination card compulsory for prospective corps members to attend orientation exercise from next year.\n\nThe scheme said from the next year, incoming prospective corps members must show evidence of vaccination before they will be allowed into the camp for registration.\n\nNYSC Director-General Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim stated these in a nationwide virtual address to the 2021 Batch \u201cC\u201d Stream Two Corps Members and camp officials.\n\nIn a statement by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations at the NYSC, Emeka Mgbemena, the DG said: \u201cWe want to ensure that we adhere strictly to the non-pharmaceutical protocols of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nIbrahim advised corps members that would complete their orientation course tomorrow to add value to themselves by acquiring skills that would make them business owners, instead of seeking the scarcely available jobs.\n\nHe said the scheme had partnered several institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria, Access Bank, Bank of Industry, NYSC Foundation, Heritage Bank and others to provide soft loans to corps members with good business proposals.\n\nBut, a retired Professor of public health, Prof. Michael Asuzu and the President, Association of Residents Doctors, University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan Chapter, Dr. Zakariyah Hussain, yesterday faulted the Federal Government over its decision to ban unvaccinated prospective corps members from accessing the orientation camps to participate in the scheme.\n\nSpeaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference of UCH ARD in Ibadan, they stated that government could not force Nigerians to take the COVID-19 vaccination, but could only persuade them.\n\nProf. Asuzu noted that in medicine and health practice, people can refuse anything they don\u2019t want because it\u2019s their right, urging the government not to force Nigerians, but appealed to them to know the importance of the vaccination.\n\nEFCC bars unvaccinated officials from entering office\n\nIlorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday barred members of staff that were yet to vaccinate from the office premises in Ilorin, the state capital.\n\nThe anti-graft commission took the step to comply with the directive of the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19.\n\nThe committee had mandated Federal civil servants to be vaccinated or have evidence of negative PCR test for COVID-19, effective from December 1, to access government offices.\n\nAccordingly, EFCC Chair Abdulrasheed Bawa directed that the Federal Government\u2019s directive be complied with, in all the commands of the commission, including its Head Office, Abuja. Deputy zonal commander of the command Mrs. Atinuke Akinroyeje led the enforcement.\n\nWHO makes case for health fund\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has urged the Federal Government to increase its investment in the health sector, especially now that the country is battling COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks.\n\nIt noted that aside from the COVID-19 pandemic, the country is faced with high burdens of HIV, Tuberculosis, Malaria, and respiratory tract infections; increasing cases of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including hypertension, diabetes and cancers and frequent disease outbreaks such as cholera, Lassa fever, yellow fever, meningitis, etc.\n\nWHO Country Representative Dr Walter Mulombo stated these to commemorate this year\u2019s global Universal Health Coverage Day.\n\nFirst Omicron death confirmed in UK\n\nUnited Kingdom (UK) Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed the death of one person from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\n\nHe warned of a looming \u201ctidal wave\u201d of Omicron infections, with cases doubling every two to three days across Britain.\n\nAs the Delta variant continues to drive up coronavirus infections in the United States, Britain has now shifted its focus to Omicron, which officials warn is spreading at a \u201cphenomenal rate\u201d. The UK re-imposed some restrictions yesterday in a bid to slow Omicron\u2019s spread and give scientists time to find out just how much more transmissible it is, how successful it will be at evading current vaccines, and whether it is any more severe than previous variants.\n\nGhana\u2019s airport to fine airlines carrying unvaccinated passengers\n\nThe operator of Ghana\u2019s main international airport will fine airlines 3,500 dollars for every passenger they bring in that is not vaccinated against the COVID-19 or that tests positive for the coronavirus on arrival.\n\nThe rules, announced by Ghana Airports yesterday, follow others introduced last week by the health ministry that require people entering Ghana to be vaccinated.\n\nThey come into effect for the Kotoka International Airport in the capital Accra today.\n\nThe requirements are some of the strictest in Africa where vaccine uptake has been slow due to lack of supply and logistical challenges, and come as the new Omicron variant raises concerns about quicker transmission of the virus.\n\nGhana, one of West Africa\u2019s largest economies that runs on exports of cocoa, gold, and oil, has so far vaccinated a little over 5 per cent of its population of 30 million, data compiled by Reuters showed.\n\nIts health service has recorded 131,412 infections and 1,239 deaths from COVID-19, according to the data.\n\nOver the last two weeks, COVID-19 cases recorded at Kotoka airport accounted for about 60 per cent of total infections in the country, the health service said on Friday.",

          "text": "A North-Central governor is under probe for allegedly withdrawing N60 billion in cash in six years, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Executive Chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa has confirmed.\n\nThe fraud, according to him, was uncovered by the newly-created Department of Intelligence under his administration.\n\nHe spoke of plans to update Nigerians on the behind-the-scene investigations bordering on cybercrime and politically exposed persons (PEPs), adding that the agency has secured 1,576 convictions within 11 months.\n\nBawa\u2019s disclosures were contained in an interview published in EFCC Alert, an in-house journal of the commission.\n\nAlthough the interview was said to have been granted to Television Continental (TVC), the transcript was published in the magazine.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOnly one of the six states in the Northcentral is controlled by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The others are under the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nBawa did not however, disclose the identity of the affected governor.\n\nThere were indications that President Muhammadu Buhari has received preliminary report on the governor.\n\nBawa said: \u201cI can tell you for free that the new Department of Intelligence that we have created is working. They have come up with a lot of intelligence.\n\n\u201cIn one of them, a governor in a Northcentral state within the last six years (one individual) has withdrawn over N60 billion in cash.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at all of that, and I assure you that at the end of all of our investigations, Nigerians are going to be briefed of what we are doing behind-the-scene on cybercrime, politically exposed persons as well as engaging government agencies to ensure that we have better processes and procedures on how to do government business.\u201d\n\nBawa, who confirmed that ex-Governor Lucky Igbinedion is still under investigation after the initial conviction, tersely addressed the case.\n\nHe added: \u201cI can assure you that we are working (on them). We don\u2019t want to talk about matters that are under investigation.\n\n\u201cYes, we invited a former governor (Lucky Igbinedion) for interrogation. He was with us for two days and he has been released. Investigation is ongoing, but we are being careful and cautious. So, we won\u2019t be accused of engaging in a media trial.\u201d\n\nOn the convictions secured by the agency since he came on board, Bawa said: \u201cFrom January to November 16, 2021 we have recorded an unprecedented 1,576 convictions; it is an unprecedented number of convictions.\n\n\u201cThe highest number of convictions that the Commission secured previously was 1,282 or thereabout. So, we have beaten that record.\n\n\u201cI have said it time and again; no agency of government has contributed to the development of law in Nigeria in the last 10 years than the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWe are changing the narrative here, because I will also want to report that 122 were discharged and acquitted.\n\n\u201cNow compare that with the success that we have recorded in terms of convictions. It shows that we lost less than 10 per cent of our cases. That means when you compare by way of measurements, you will see that it is a 90 per cent success rate.\n\n\u201cWe are all over the place trying to see that we eradicate economic and financial crime through the court processes and other preventive measures that we have in place.\u201d\n\nOn the seizure of a N20 billion bailout funds, which Kogi State Government has disputed as false, Bawa said: \u201cThe records are straight. Based on what we told the court, the court agreed with us and the funds were frozen.\n\n\u201cOf course, at the end of the day, the funds have been returned to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the betterment of Nigerians that are to utilise them.\n\n\u201cWe have recovered N20 billion from the bailout fund that is given to them. So, that is the record and the evidence is there\n\n\u201cWe are not setting out to be engaging with people on the pages of newspapers or press conferences. We are working hard behind the scenes (to eradicate corruption).\n\n\u201cAnd very soon, Nigerians are going to see some of the things that we are doing.\u201d\n\nBawa restated EFCC\u2019s determination to uphold the fundamental rights of suspects, adding that all the sting operations on cybercrime suspects, popularly called Yahoo boys, were within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe described as unfortunate that some of the operations were misunderstood.\n\nThe EFCC chair said: \u201cWe are in a world of social media, where any small thing can be magnified (beyond the ordinary).\n\n\u201cIt is not in our character [to harass anybody]. That is not what we set out to do. That is not what has happened. From January to date, we have arrested nothing less than 2,000 alleged suspected cybercriminals across the country. And then you have one or two persons complaining. .\n\n\u201cBut then, look at the ratio, vis-avis people that were arrested and people that are complaining. Indeed, we look inwards to see where we are wrong, and we correct and address it. Of course, we need to be concerned about the human rights of people.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our responsibilities to investigate suspected cybercriminals. All those sting operations that we carried out came as a result of a series of surveillance activities as well as intelligence and information gathered before we moved in.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, from January to now, we have carried out in sting several locations, and if only one or two are complaining out of thousands of such sting operations, I think, it is still a pass mark.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that all of the sting operations that we carried out, we carried them out professionally, within the ambit of the law. We are a law abiding institution and we will continue to be a law-abiding institution.\u201d",

          "text": "From Uche Usim and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja Abuja\n\nIn the spirit of equivalent retaliation, Minister of Aviation, Mr Hadi Sirika, yesterday announced the temporary ban of flights from all nations that put Nigeria on their red list following the discovery of a few cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the country.\n\nThe countries affected are Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Canada and Argentina. Flights from their territories into Nigeria have been banned till further notice tomorrow.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThis is as the Federal Government locks horns with the government of the United Arab Emirates over what it described as an insulting and unacceptable letter wherein it justified the reasons it granted only one slot a week to Air Peace but expected to enjoy 21 frequencies into Nigeria every week.\n\nSirika, in an audio message made available to Daily Sun, said the sovereign interest of over 200 million Nigerians was too important for any foreign government to toy with it.\n\nHe warned that any country that rubbishes all diplomatic etiquettes and bilateral agreements to slam unfair deals on Nigerians will be resisted and served in similar measures as tit for tat remains a fair play.\n\nOn the Emirates-Air Peace impasse, Sirika said the issue leaves a sour taste in the mouth, insisting that the Federal Government would stick to its guns until UAE allows for a level playing field.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in as a government, UAE requested 21 frequencies, meaning that they will be coming to Nigeria 21 times in a week or simplified as three times a day; two in Lagos, one in Abuja. Well, even this was something that the Buhari administration gave them. They had just 14 frequencies when we came, and it was seven for Lagos and seven for Abuja. They never operated Abuja daily until when we came.\n\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019ve got an airline, a Nigerian airline, which is Air Peace that applied to get only three out of the 21 frequencies, and I approved. So, Air Peace wanted to be going into the UAE three times a week. So, UAE refused to approve the three frequencies for Air Peace. They insisted on giving them only one frequency and it was in Sharjah not Dubai. Now, we are giving them 21 frequencies from our agreement, they ought to give us 21. So, what they\u2019re supposed to do is to give Air Peace 21. And then it is up to Air Peace to operate all the 21 or do three. So, we went back and forth with them. Right here in Colombia, we had a meeting with them and we said okay, well, we are going to also look at it and give you also one frequency as against 21. So, they wrote us a very insulting letter that referred to meeting discussions and agreement \u2018bla bla bla bla\u2019, in accordance with a bilateral agreement between the two countries and having looked at our operations with great pain we\u2019re giving you or Air Peace one slot in Sharjah. And that\u2019s the best we can do in the circumstance that our airports are full.\u2019\n\nSo, this is very insulting and this is not acceptable by international treaty, convention or agreement. And therefore, I directed that they also be given one frequency and into Abuja. So, whoever, and beginning from the 12th or 13th, they will only come once into the country. So, anybody who wants to get out using Emirates should get out on the 12th maximum. And then when he wants to return he should book his return, he should make sure that that return date is on a Thursday and that is to Abuja and get his booking confirmed.\n\n\u201cI know they can be under pressure because they\u2019ve lost a lot of money in the past. Honestly, who cares? But they are not coming. They are losing a lot of money. We also in Nigeria are losing the service they provide and are also losing some economic activity as a result of that coming. But the sovereignty of 200 million people is too important for us to toy with. So, on behalf of the 200 million Nigerians, we have taken the decision that they also be given one slot. And this is just for your information. And there\u2019s nothing grandstanding, it\u2019s just the way things are in civil aviation,\u201d the Minister explained.\n\nOn the series of travel ban, Sirika said he participated in a Zoom meeting of the COVID-19 tax force, stressing that the Nigerian government would draw strength from the agreements at the meeting to shut its doors on those who also shut out Nigerians.\n\n\u201cJust for your information, we recommended that those countries, Canada, UK, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, who banned Nigerians, we also put them on the red list, just the same as they did to us.\u201d\n\n\u2022We\u2019re in regular contact with other countries \u2013UK\n\nThe United Kingdom has said it is in regular conversations with other countries about their travel policies.\n\nThis was even as the United Kingdom said it has been clear that travel abroad will be different this year and countries may impose border measures at short notice in line with their own coronavirus policies.\n\nHead of Communications, British High Commission, Abuja, Dean Hurlock, stated this in response to the continuous criticism of the travel ban slammed on Nigeria by the United Kingdom as a result of the COVID-19 Variant of Concern (VOC) Omicron.\n\nHe said the Government of the United Kingdom proposed sticking to its standard background lines on whether a particular country will put the United Kingdom on the red list and avoid getting into hypothetical situations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that travel abroad will be different this year and countries may impose border measures at short notice in line with their own coronavirus policies.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "Buhari Never Promised Tinubu Running Mate, His Boys Fire Back at Akande",
          "text": "Insist what president promised was partnership\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe last may not have been heard of some of the revelations in the newly published autobiography by a former governor of Osun State and erstwhile protem national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, who claimed in his book, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, that President Muhammadu Buhari, reneged in his promise to make a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, his running mate ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nBut many of Buhari\u2019s close allies and foot soldiers, who were privy to some of the negotiations and horse-trading that preceded the 2015 elections, dismissed the account by Akande as being twisted and far from the truth, because according to them, \u201cBuhari truly and only promised Tinubu a workable partnership, which included conceding the vice presidential slot to the South-west as a bloc, not to exactly make him his running mate.\u201d\n\nA lot of the Buhari boys , yesterday, called THISDAY with respect to its lead story last Friday, titled: \u2018Akande: Buhari Promised to Pick Tinubu as Running Mate in 2015, Then Reneged,\u2019 which was an extract from Akande\u2019s autobiography, saying they were dismayed over the report and strongly disagreed with the author\u2019s account of events.\n\nAccording to them, all that Buhari said was that he was going to partner and work with Tinubu, in the context of a partnership between the South-west and North-west , reiterating that the p resident never promised Tinubu vice president or running mate, contrary to claims by Akande in the book.\n\nThis, the sources, who often glibly referred to themselves as Buhari\u2019s boys, added was because they recognised \u201c the role Tinubu played in helping them and the role of the South-west for voting en bloc during the convention that produced Buhari, which was pivotal and he presented the vice president ial slot in the partnership.\n\n\u201c And, in all of this, what Akande did not disclose was that Buhari sent a delegation of Farouk Aliyu, Hadi Sirika and Sarki Abba, to meet Tinubu and explained to him that the Muslim-Muslim ticket would not work, but that they would be partners to work together. \u201d\n\nThe Buhari boys, have however, concluded that the former Osun governor appeared to have taken up the task of \u201c a political bull, try ing to force Buhari\u2019s hands to support Tinubu in 2023 . But that, we will not accept, even though no one is opposed to his aspiration. \u201d\n\nThey maintained that Chief Akande\u2019s account was deliberately slanted, to not only make Tinubu look good and weep up sentiment for him, but also send the president on a guilt trip and compel him to side with the former Lagos governor, who has shown keen interest, albeit clandestinely, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn the THISDAY lead report of Friday, which detailed how Akande, in his autobiography, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed that Buhari, apparently under pressure from certain interests and forces, dropped Tinubu from running with him on the party\u2019s ticket, concluded that the then candidate of APC reneged on the agreement they had even after the merger had been sealed.\n\nIn the book , launched in Lagos, Akande, who also took a swipe at some Yoruba leaders including former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Chief Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, claimed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his running mate , Buhari later faltered, saying he only wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner with him.\u201d\n\nHis account stated thus: \u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket? I thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter , when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nH e, h owever, expressed surprise that , when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari w ould pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019 Oyegun said. He apologised. I didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that .\n\n\u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes! \u201d\n\nAkande further said some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running , a move himself and former g overnor of Edo S tate, Adams Oshiomhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiomhole, then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u201c Did we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know later that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket , and that it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting , which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u201c General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership .\n\n\u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered. \u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ayu: There\u2019ll Be No APC by April 2023",
          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja, George Okoh in Makurdi and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nWith a voice of undisputed charisma, and exuding confidence born of success in previous political assignments,\n\nNational Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday, sent a strong message to the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its government, saying by March or April 2023 there may not a party called APC in the country.\n\nAyu spoke at the weekend at Government House, Makurdi, when he addressed party stakeholders. He described the ruling APC as \u201ca contraption\u201d with neither programme nor ideological position, predicting its collapse by the next general election year.\n\nIn a related development, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike urged the PDP chairman to bring his enormous political knowledge and experience to bear on his new assignment. Wike said the ultimate challenge for Ayu was the rebuilding of the main opposition party and its restoration to winning ways.\n\nWike made the assertions yesterday at an interdenominational thanksgiving church service and reception organised for the PDP national chairman by the Benue State government in conjunction with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Benue State Chapter.\n\nAyu reiterated that PDP would win at least 25 of the states in the 2023 governorship polls.\n\nThe former senate president assured the stakeholders, who included aspirants to various elective positions, that the party would not impose candidates on the people ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement from Ayu\u2019s media office said, \u201cBy March/April 2023, there will be no APC in Nigeria. APC is a contraption, a contraption to win power, but they have no programme or any ideological position on what to do with power.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we will be coming back in every state and at the federal level to take over power, with a coherent programme of action, and with which we will implement workable policies, as we were doing before.\u201d\n\nThe new PDP chairman was full of praises for the Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, saying he is following in the footsteps of the late Moses Adasu. He dismissed reports of competition between himself and former Senate President David Mark. Ayu disclosed that it was actually Mark, who advised him to go for the PDP national chairmanship.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am telling you this story, because it shows that at any one time we are united in Benue, definitely, Nigeria will not ignore us. This is not the first time we have attained victory by our collective effort. In 2019, when they said there was federal might, we said the allied forces of Benue were ready for the federal might, and we defeated that federal might.\u201d\n\nAyu emphasised the need for party unity and respect for popular decisions, stressing, \u201cI urge us to continue to work together. Don\u2019t be afraid of federal might. The allied forces of Benue are still as united as ever. And today, we are even stronger.\n\n\u201cI believe whoever emerges as a candidate for any elective position, once the list is forwarded to Abuja, I don\u2019t want Governor Ortom or his candidates to come to lobby. This is because the decision of Benue people will be respected at all times.\u201d\n\nHe bemoaned the deplorable security situation in the country, especially, the daily killings, but said Nigerians should not lose hope, as PDP was coming to rescue and rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cDo not lose hope, Nigerians,\u201d Ayu stated, adding, \u201cDo not lose hope in Nigeria just because a small group of people have come to destroy her. Let us join hands and get rid of them, and reclaim and rebuild our country.\u201d\n\nHe charged party faithful to intensify work at the ward levels so as to commence the rescue mission from bottom up, adding that the immediate task of the party is to ensure victory in Ekiti and Osun governorship elections.\n\nAyu said the party would work vigorously to regain leadership of the National Assembly, enlist more women and youths, as well as halt defection from PDP to other political parties.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the presidency, we will be fair to all aspirants. There will be no favoured aspirant. We will provide a level playing ground for everyone.\n\n\u201cThe next president will be a product of the PDP. We will come up with a strong manifesto indicating what programme will be given to our candidate to prosecute, unlike the APC that had no programme in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe urge Nigerians not to lose hope, because a small collection of people have come together to divide us. We are a productive people, who are respected across the world. Do not allow the current leadership to destroy the tenacity of this nation.\n\n\u201cPDP will be back with good policy, the economy will come back to life, and we will start exporting again. As a party, we have done the needful. We will work hard to rebuild our nation and shame the foreign detractors, who say Nigeria will break up.\n\n\u201cWe will be in the forefront of world affairs again. I\u2019m determined to follow in the footsteps of Aper Aku, JS Tarka, and Adasu. APC is using propaganda to make it look like PDP is gone. We have mapped out strategies and agenda to take the party to the height. We will work as a team, leading the army to victory. Every member of the party will be carried along. PDP will fight to win Ekiti and Osun governorship elections.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the thanksgiving service, Wike admonished the PDP national chairman to restore the party by ensuring the reconciliation of aggrieved members, who had left the party, with a view to winning the 2023 general election. The governor extolled Ayu\u2019s vast political experience, but reminded him of the enormous task ahead to rescue Nigeria from the APC federal government in 2023.\n\nWike said, \u201cToday is not a day to talk about APC. Today is the day to join the people of Benue State in thanking God for His mercies. Today is a day we shall be able to tell our National Chairman plainly what the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) expects from him and how we are going to stand by him to make sure this party is rebuilt, in order to put themselves together and to take over power in 2023.\n\n\u201cHistory is beckoning on you. Yes, they have said you are former Minister of Industry, you are former Minister of Interior, you are former Minister of Education, even Environment. And former Senate President, but you have never been saddled with the responsibility to rescue Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a former minister, you were not given the opportunity to rescue Nigeria. Nigeria was not what it is now. Therefore, the battle to rescue Nigeria, the battle to change leadership in 2023 is on you.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be easy for you. The time for work has come and that is when we will know the experiences you have gathered, how you want to put it to use and rebuild the Peoples Democratic Party. It is very, very important.\n\n\u201cWe want you to use your experiences, as people have said, to make sure even those, who have left the party, should be brought back to the party.\u201d\n\nWike urged Ayu not to be distracted by the political ambitions of party members, but focus on rebuilding PDP into a formidable party.\n\nHe told the new PDP chairman, \u201cLet me also tell you, Mr. Chairman, do not be distracted about who will be presidential aspirant, let them not disturb you. Go, focus and rebuild the party. Once the party is rebuilt, I can assure you, you have somebody that will stand in this party, and Nigerians will vote for that person. What is important for you now is to see what you can do. Be focused; let nobody distract you.\n\n\u201cI want to plead with you, let people not tell you to begin to go to one governor\u2019s place or the other in order for the governors forum to be divided. At the end of the day, the party will suffer. Your business is, if the governors are not united, unite the governors, so that they can work for the interest of the party. It is very key.\n\n\u201cToday we have lost focus in the National Assembly, and so you have to put our party together to make sure our members of National Assembly speak with one voice and be opposition party they\u2019re supposed to be.\n\n\u201cYes, I supported you, I voted for you, because I have the belief you can turn PDP to success in 2023. But if you\u2019re not doing well, Mr. Chairman, I will shout, I will say, Mr. Chairman, this is not what we expected from you.\u201d\n\nWike commended the successful election that ushered in the new leadership of the party and assured the national chairman of his commitment, along with other governors of the party, to his success in the national rescue project.\n\nMark and former Senate President Bukola Saraki, while extolling the virtues of Ayu, said he had the competence to lead the party back to power in 2023.\n\nSaraki said, \u201cWe are here to give confidence and hope to Nigerians, but I see a brighter future. PDP always gets victory from Benue. North-central assures you of total cooperation. I do not have any doubt because you are a man of character.\n\n\u201cThe new leadership will address the myriad of problems confronting the country. We re ready to rescue the country. Passion and love will guide us to achieve our goals.\u201d\n\nHe called on Ayu to be honest and frank.\n\nMeanwhile, new National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, described the APC as a party of strange bedfellows, who were power grabbers. Ologunagba alleged, \u201cAPC is a gathering of strange bedfellows. Today, it has 90 states chairmen, instead of 36, and each of them loyal to a warlord. How can they elect their national leadership?\u201d\n\nHe also said the goal of the Ayu-led PDP was to improve the economy by implementing well thought-out policies and programmes, and pay special attention to infrastructure, especially, electricity and rail transport.\n\nIn a statement, Ologunagba said the National Working Committee (NWC) of PDP appreciated the unprecedented courage displayed by Nigerians in the last six years of the APC government.\n\nHe said, \u201cUnder the APC, Nigerians continued to experience insecurity ravaging the country, unprecedented unemployment, an economy in shambles, almost collapsing, the naira failing daily, industries are packing up daily, education standards falling, health sector in comatose, infrastructure decay and stagnation, and scaring disunity and suspicion pervades the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Can Kenya get out of the supply chain crisis?",
          "text": "Q4 is coming to a close, the holiday season is upon us, and Kenya\u2019s businesses are settling their accounts for the year.\n\nIn many ways, transport and logistics, which support numerous sectors of the Kenyan economy, seem to be on an upswing. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reported a 4.4% growth in container traffic during the first eight months of the year, and Kenya\u2019s all-new port at Lamu launched in May.\n\nBut, alongside positive figures and groundbreaking infrastructure projects that point to an optimistic outlook for the logistics industry, Kenya\u2014just like the US, UK, and other countries throughout the world\u2014is also feeling the impact of a COVID-19-induced supply chain shortage.\n\nWill tech offer a solution to help the industry sustain itself?\n\nA global meltdown\n\nOn a global level, the supply chain meltdown began with a container shortage that cropped up at the end of 2020, with freight rates rising higher than 264%, compared to previous years. Prior to this, containers moved from China to Europe and North America, but COVID-19 restrictions limited air freight, creating an increased demand that prevented the flow of containers back to East Asia.\n\nFollowing that, demand for Chinese exports skyrocketed after a pandemic-induced slump. At this point, global supply chains were already out of balance, and demand for exports exceeded the supply of shipping containers.\n\nBy March 2021, shipping container rates from China to the US and Europe had increased by 300%, compared to the year before.\n\nTrade under lockdown\n\nIn Kenya, it began with a lockdown.\n\nThe start of the pandemic led to a gridlock in Kenya\u2019s transport industry that had an immediate impact on the country itself, and the region as a whole.\n\nIndustries with markets outside of the East African community were among the hardest hit. East Africa\u2019s flower industry, for example, which ships fresh flowers via air to European countries, suffered an estimated $1 billion in losses when European countries sealed their borders. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-largest flower exporter, also reported an 80% reduction in flower export volume.\n\nDue to restricted sea and air routes, imports to Kenya decreased by 23%, but the permission of select land transport that allowed goods to flow by land between borders meant that \u201cother countries in the East African community benefited,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno, Trade and Policy Manager at the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). For example, trade between Kenya, an exporter of palm oil, petroleum oil, and salt, and Uganda, an exporter of milk, tobacco, cane, and energy, increased by 11.3%.\n\nBut transport by land between the countries was still slow and prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs positive COVID cases began to increase in East Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya agreed to test all truck drivers entering and exiting the three countries. However, unequal distribution of COVID-19 resources and inadequate supply chains to get them to East Africa meant a scarce number of test kits. This led to a buildup of drivers along the border, lost goods, an overall decrease of truck inflows into Uganda, and an increase in shipping cost at around 48%.\n\nWhile the flower industry is rebounding and trucks are moving more freely, the temporary dismemberment of the supply chain industry may continue to have knock-on effects on businesses in the East African economy.\n\nShortages\n\nThe US is already feeling inflationary pressures caused by supply chain issues that have resulted in a 6.2% increase in the US Consumer Price Index\u2014a measurement used to estimate price changes in a basket of goods\u2014compared to last year.\n\nKenya is experiencing a similar phenomenon.\n\nIn April, the cost of bread in Kenya increased by $.044 for the first time in four years and is set to increase yet again. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) points to lower global wheat stocks, marine freight issues, and the rising cost of fuel to its highest levels in the past 10 years as the causes of the price increase.\n\nReliability is key\n\nKenya\u2019s potential supply chain crisis and its impact can be mitigated.\n\nA major aspect of the rise in prices caused by the current meltdowns is uncertainty, which can be costly in the logistics industry.\n\nThe market is currently highly uncertain, which can present difficulties for even the most well organised businesses.\n\n\u201cThe shipping lines are like a small mafia,\u201d said Dr. Simeon Obidairo, co-owner of BoConcept, a contemporary, Danish, luxury furniture line in the process of reopening in Nairobi.\u201cThey tell you transit times for the shipping is going to be six weeks; the shipment leaves, and they end up delivering it 12 weeks later. So, we\u2019ve seen at least double the typical transit times.\u201d\n\nA typical method of organising and tracking shipments to lessen supply chain disruptions is through the use of technology, which, when underutilised, creates major operational kinks that can be cumbersome to correct.\n\nLogi-tech\n\nA new Personal Information Protection Law out of China, for example, is preventing the provision of real-time shipping information by some China-based shipping companies, triggering fears of further shipping disruptions. As China is home to six out of 10 of the world\u2019s largest container ports, this has caused a 90% drop in terrestrial shipping data that companies use to track the arrival and departure of essential goods.\n\nEast Africa\u2019s logistics industry is still growing to a place where it is similarly tech-reliant. At present, most trade in the region happens informally. But more reliability is highly desired: \u201cWe need frameworks to support digital trade,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno. \u201cWhatever the client has ordered should be what they actually get. And if it isn\u2019t, there should be a mechanism to address these issues.\u201d\n\nDue to pandemic-induced demand shocks, transporters in the region also cut back. As consumption rises amid holiday festivities, and businesses increase capacity, those who fail to become more tech-reliant may find themselves \u201cill-positioned across the country primarily due to the low adoption of technology by the industry,\u201d said Tayo Oyegunle, COO of Moove, a logistics platform that offers on-demand solutions to both customers and businesses within East Africa.\n\nInvestor appetite for the transport and logistics sector was still high in 2021, with a total of $200 million raised by the industry as a whole in Africa during the first eight months of the year. But, much of this has been attributed to the January commencement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a 34-member-state-strong agreement that aims to introduce non-tariff barriers throughout the African continent.\n\nBut, the AfCFTA\u2019s success for Kenya and the region as a whole also necessitates more coordination on a technological level. Without it, it may be years before we see supply chain issues corrected and an environment for freer trade realised.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How African startups can build multi-million dollar deals",
          "text": "The year 2021 has set many new standards for Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. As reporter Alexander Onwukwue states, \u201cIt\u2019s the year African startups normalised $100 million rounds.\u201d It\u2019s the year francophone Africa produced its first unicorn, Wave, which raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nIt\u2019s also the year of mergers and acquisitions, with over 333 M&A deals worth $51 billion done in the first half of the year alone, a 567% increase in deal value from 2020\u2019s $8 billion. Following Stripe\u2019s acquisition of Paystack in a $200 million deal in 2020, quite a number of notable acquisitions have occurred. From Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha, MaxAB\u2019s acquisition of Morocco\u2019s WaystoCap, and even Piggyvest\u2019s acquisition of Savi, companies in the ecosystem are consolidating to solve some of the continent\u2019s taxing issues.\n\nOne of the biggest acquisition deals of 2021 is MFS Africa\u2019s deal with Capricorn. In October, MFS Africa\u2014the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa\u2014signed a deal to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies. While the amount is undisclosed, both parties confirmed that the deal is Nigeria\u2019s \u201csecond-largest\u201d fintech acquisition deal, second only to Paystack\u2019s $200 million acquisition deal with Stripe.\n\nBut how do hundred-million-dollar deals get made? And why are more startups hitching their wagons together? On December 3, TechCabal brought Dare Okoudjou, MFS Africa CEO, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn together in a live session to answer some of these questions.\n\nBig deals start out small\n\nFor Dare Okoudjou\u2014who has led MFS Africa\u2019s growth in 35 African countries\u2014big deals and acquisitions don\u2019t always start out as big deals. \u201cBig deals are done over time, and sometimes, they start off as minority investments talks which evolve into acquisition talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time Degbola and I spoke in 2014, Capricorn had just started and we\u2014MFS Africa\u2014we\u2019re trying to help him raise money. Fast forward to 2020, and we\u2019re speaking about acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn.\n\nOn Capricorn\u2019s end, Degbola Abudu and his team had been fundraising for a while, and while they weren\u2019t planning on getting acquired, the deal was a realistic next step for them. \u201cInitially, MFS Africa was supposed to be an investor. Conversations for this present deal started even before COVID, and by the end of 2020, when it became clearer, we were more open to it. There were many conversations between myself and Dare, and many more between myself and the Capricorn board.\u201d\n\nWhile Capricorn\u2019s motivation for taking the deal was geared towards sustainability, MFS Africa\u2019s was targeted at growth and expansion. \u201cMFS has agent networks in 35 SSA countries and the opportunity to merge that with what exists in Nigeria isn\u2019t easily replicated,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cWe\u2019d been eyeing Nigeria for a while, hoping that the mobile money network would kick-off, but it didn\u2019t. On the other hand, there was Capricorn which had built a strong agent network of 90,000 agents. When we realised that, it was evident what the next steps were.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust and partnerships\n\nRecognising strategic partnerships is something that can be said of MFS Africa\u2019s earlier acquisitions. Prior to Capricorn, MFS Africa had acquired two other companies. In 2020, the company acquired Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech delivering payment management solutions to SMEs. That deal also started off with several conversations on strategic partnerships between Beyonic\u2019s CEO, Luke Kyouhere.\n\nIn 2016, MFS Africa acquired Sochitel\u2014a company that specialised in international airtime transfers into Africa\u2014and the acquisition, according to MFS Africa, helped create the largest transfer payment network which focuses on Africa.\n\nThe company has also made six minority investments in companies across the continent including Maviance, Numida, Julaya, and Inclusivity solutions. One crucial thing that has helped these relationships\u2014investments and acquisitions\u2014is trust.\n\n\u201cIn considering acquisitions at MFS Africa, we start with our destination, our North star. We want to be in all 54 African countries, and we don\u2019t want borders to matter. You can be in Benin and make transactions with people in Zambia, or in Nigeria. Over time, we\u2019ve calculated what that means, infrastructure and regulation-wise for us. And when we want to invest or acquire a company, we ask ourselves how or if that investment or acquisition will bring us closer to these goals. That\u2019s usually the starting point,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cThe thing that usually makes or breaks these things is the people. Because, in the end, if you can\u2019t work with the people, it doesn\u2019t matter what the spreadsheets say.\u201d\n\nAbudu also agrees that trust is a necessary ingredient to any big deal. \u201cOther than being realistic, trust was one thing we had to show, and for that to happen, we had to be open on our end. We had to be clear what the acquisition meant for our people and it was important to be open about everything. That\u2019s what startups need to understand. Hiding things won\u2019t help you in the long run, and with trust, you can even work towards solving some of those crucial points together.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

While some startups focus on building digital consumer banks, others focus on building banks for businesses, or for both.\n\nOne startup building for both is Kenya-based Kwara, a one-stop-shop core digital banking infrastructure for Savings and Credit Co-operatives (SACCOs) to manage all their activities, and it has raised $4 million seed funding.\n\nThe new investment will be used to facilitate the launching of its neobank; further develop its existing app; double down on its marketing efforts; and increase its talent pool.\n\nThe investment was led by Breega, with participation from SoftBank Vision Fund, Emerge, FINCA Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest, Do Good Invest, Raba Capital, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity, and fintech angels.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile many people think that SACCOs are a slow, vulnerable, and outdated way of saving and accessing credit, and that the market needs new agile products that could displace this model, Kwara, founded by Cynthis Wandia (CEO) and David Hwan (CTO), wants to keep it going by enhancing its efficiency through digitising all its core functionalities.\n\nA true cooperative guardian angel\n\nWendia had just rounded up her first startup and joined Finparx, a venture builder in Germany, to work as a venture developer; there she spent most of her days staring eye-to-eye at different problems. But what struck her the most was the problem of coffee farmers not getting much value for their hard work. Wendia\u2019s grandmother was a coffee farmer in Kenya so this was nostalgic.\n\nShe became curious and started digging. Her interest started off from a trade finance angle, looking at the supply chain, to see if there was something that could be done. But the more she looked at the value chain, starting from the farmer\u2019s point of view to export, she kept coming across this institution called the credit union or the cooperative, which is effectively like a financial institution or bank, but owned by its clients.\n\n\u201cI noticed, for example, that for my grandmother, the cooperative had walked with her on her entire economic journey. The more I looked into it, the more we saw just how incredible this institution is in offering extremely affordable financial products like savings, loans and pension,\u201d Wendia told TechCabal.\n\nSo, after further research on SACCOs in Kenya and across the world, Wendia and her team realised that these cooperatives are a sort of informal bank, \u201cthe fairest bank\u201d, in Wendia\u2019s words. But they saw how far behind they were in leveraging technology that could take their efficiency from zero to 100. \u201cSo, we launched Kwara as a technology infrastructure for SACCOs,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nIn 2019, the Kwara core banking product was launched and, ever since, has become a safe haven for Kenyan cooperatives. But the ambition has expanded from just being a banking infrastructure to becoming an operating system for every growth-oriented SACCO in Kenya.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nAccording to Wendia, the platform now powers over 50 cooperatives, with over 65,000 backend users. The company is reportedly growing its credit union customer base by 40% month-on-month, and the listed credit unions are growing their membership by 19% and their loan base by 46%, annually. There are currently more than $142 million assets under management at a $40 million monthly transaction across savings, loan disbursement, pension and lots more.\n\nBecause Kenya is a big market for cooperatives, the company is going through a product expansion as opposed to market expansion. Though it\u2019s reported to be courting some credit union clients in South Africa and the Philippines, which, according to the CEO, validates their solution across multiple markets. The company wants to focus on eliminating the existing frictions in the Kenyan market, a move that will somewhat guarantee seamless replication across other markets.\n\nFor instance, in a bid to become an operating system for SACCO, it has partnered with Workpay, a human resource management and payroll processing solutions company, to enable SACCOs automate their human resource (HR) processes as a complimentary service to Kwara\u2019s products. Onboarded SACCOs will be able to carry out seamless payroll processing into SACCO accounts and enjoy access to an HR module for efficient management of their staff.\n\n\u201cWe have also partnered with Lami insurance API provider, which plugs us into about 20 underwriters in Kenya. Now, our customers [SACCOs] can negotiate or choose fantastic insurance products right from our platform,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Kwara?\n\nThere are over 300 million people currently banking within emerging markets, and that number is growing at 6% year-on-year. Kwara aims to increase that to at least 1 billion by the end of the decade, positioning itself as the platform for $500bn in transactions between credit unions and their members.\n\nDue to that, it\u2019s launching a new bank that will be powered by its existing credit unions. The play here is to turn over 65,000 backend users into early users of its neobank while onboarding more credit unions to ramp up more users.\n\nThe neobank will allow members of credit unions to deposit money directly to their credit union accounts, repay their loans, and apply for instant loans while tracking their finances and payments, all in a seamless manner. In addition, Kwara is building an open banking infrastructure via an open API that allows credit unions to integrate with payment gateways, banks, and third-party vendors, enabling a full marketplace. Also, any unbanked individual can easily join a credit union and then enjoy the whole banking benefits.\n\nSpeaking on launching a neobank and on the investment that will make it possible. Kwara CEO, Cynthia Wandia, says, \u201cWe are building a solution for people\u2014an estimated 1 billion\u2014who do not currently have access to personalised banking services. This is the result of a gap in banking-grade technology and the lack of neobank-like experiences for the end clients.\u201d\n\nShe said they [Kwara] have been thrilled to see the \u201cexcitement around the Kwara brand among credit unions and their members, which is fast becoming synonymous with a superior user experience and the future of banking. Thanks to our investors, we will now be able to offer an end-client experience that is 100 times better than what they previously had access to\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking,\u201d said Ben Marrel, Founding partner at Breega, who led the investment. \u201cKwara\u2019s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions. We are both proud and excited to be helping this outstanding team scale across Africa and other emerging markets.\u201d\n\nKwara aims\u2014without branching away from its core mission of empowering credit unions across Africa and the rest of the world\u2014to help 1 billion people benefit from credit unions through its neobank by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "GIG Mobility (GIGM, formerly GIG Motors), a Nigeria-based mobility giant, this week launched electronic wallet and bills payment features on its app, as the company looks to expand its offerings beyond road mobility.\n\nThe new features allow its more than 600,000 users to \u201cfund their e-wallet and pay bills in a matter of seconds,\u201d GIGM said in a statement. Available in only Nigeria for now, users will be able to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and internet data.\n\nOver the next few years, there are plans to launch the service in other African countries, such as Ghana, where GIGM expanded into two years ago.\n\n\u201cMobility is more versatile than it is generally perceived to be,\u201d Jude Odum, GIGM\u2019s Chief Operating Officer told TechCabal, explaining the rationale behind the company\u2019s move. \u201cIt is the ability to be moved or move freely and easily. The freedom associated with mobility is the experience we are making available to customers.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAccording to Odum, the new service was tested for about four months, during which the GIGM processed \u201cthousands of transactions valued at millions of naira\u201d.\n\nWith the launch of the e-wallet and payments features, GIGM will be competing in a space where a plethora of fintech apps already operate. But Odum is upbeat about the company\u2019s chances, riding on its reputation as a leading mobility brand, and expects its app user base to hit one million by the first half of next year.\n\n\u201cCredibility is a very critical factor for making buying decisions. Customers would rather choose to deal with reliable brands over popular ones,\u201d Odum said. \u201cWe may not be popular in the fintech space just yet [but] we are optimistic that our user base will grow rapidly in the coming months.\u201d\n\nGIGM\u2019s new bills payment and e-wallet features\n\nGIGM\u2019s transition from a traditional transport and logistics company to a technology-first business model began with an official name change in 2019. Odum tells TechCabal that the tech unit is the second-largest, after its core operations.\n\n\u201cWe have a robust tech team that has gleaned experiences from fintech and other sectors critical to the successful development and management of our products,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the capacity to play in this [tech] space.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, GIGM wants its app to become a one-stop shop that caters to the needs of its customers by leveraging its tech capability. Such a super-app would eliminate the need to use multiple apps to carry out daily tasks. Hence payments and e-wallet are the first of many non-core mobility features that the company intends to offer.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic gave insights to the unimaginable capabilities of technology and its application,\u201d Kenneth Nwanganga, GIGM\u2019s Chief Technology Officer said in the statement. \u201cAs all aspects of life become digitised, Nigerians now have more reasons and opportunities to connect with the GIGM brand, beyond transportation\u201d.\n\nAsked what other non-mobility solutions GIGM plans to launch soon, Odum said GIGM will continue to explore new offerings for its users.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s bills payment, tomorrow it could be a crowdfunding-based investment platform or a crypto wallet.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "MTN Nigeria, Mafab pay $546m to get 5G licence",
          "text": "In one night, Nigeria raised half a billion dollars as MTN Nigeria plc and Mafab Communications Limited on Monday paid $273,600 million each to acquire a 3.5GHz band licence for the deployment of 5G network in the country. This comes at a time when the struggling economy is unattractive to investors except for those looking at the numbers the telcos have been producing in the past 20 years.\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had announced MTN Nigeria, Mafab Communications Limited and Airtel Networks Limited as the three qualified bidders that have met the criteria for participation in the licensing process of 3.5Ghz spectrum, including payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM)\n\n\u201cArising from the poll the winning bid price is $273,600,00 million. The provisional license winners are expected to pay the winning bid price less the intention-to to bid deposit by the 24 February 2022, and payment should be made in naira at the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria exchange rate,\u201d Umar Danbatta, the executive vice chairman, NCC, said.\n\nThe 5G network is expected to help achieve much lower latency, higher bandwidth, greater device density, longer battery life for nodes and greater network flexibility.\n\nIsa Pantami, minister of communication and digital economy, speaking during the event, said the 5G network would serve as a catalyst for the successful implementation of the National Digital Economy Development and Strategy (NDEPS) for a Digital Nigeria, and also support the implementation of the National Broadband Plan.\n\nRead also: What to know about 5G spectrum licence\n\nPantami assured that the National 5G Policy for Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on September 8, 2021, would ensure effective deployment of 5G to cover major urban areas by 2025;\n\n\u201cIt will ensure security of 5G ecosystem and the protection of data, ensure that international best practices and globally accepted standards and specifications are entrenched in Nigeria\u2019s 5G ecosystem; and ensure that the required infrastructure needed for successful deployment of 5G networks such as data centres, power, etc, are catered for in deployment strategies of 5G networks,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThe minister, responding to concerns on the effect of the deployment of the network, assured that 5G would have no adverse effect on people\u2019s health nor compromise the security of the country.\n\n\u201cIn a report of the first set of 5G trials, critically reviewed and studied by stakeholders, with a view to understanding the health and security implications of deploying 5G in Nigeria, the review showed that 5G is safe for deployment in Nigeria and would not compromise our security as a country. This formed the basis for the development and eventual approval of the National Policy.\n\n\u201cLeading international organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), organs of the United Nations, have so far confirmed that the deployment of 5G networks does not cause any adverse health effects and are safe,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the opening of the 3.5GHz auction at the Abuja Transcorp Hotel Monday morning, Adeolu Akande, chairman, board of commissioners, Nigerian Communications Commission, had stated that auction was not just the offer of a premium frequency, but also aims to support the deployment of 5G in Nigeria, identified as a critical factor for the growth of the national digital economy.\n\nHe said the full socio- economic benefits of 5G technology are largely dependent on access to a variety of spectrum resources.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Spectrum plays a strategic role in meeting the insatiable demand for advanced mobile data services as well as a new wave of wireless broadband use cases such as remote object manipulation, industrial automation, virtual and augmented reality as well as next-generation connectivity for vehicles. These use cases will continue to increase the impact that mobile services have on societies and economies.\n\n\u201cThe impact of 5G technology on the economy of nations is unprecedented,\u201d according to the year 2020 global edition of the GSMA\u2019s flagship Mobile Economy\u2019 Report, 5G is forecasted to contribute $2.2 trillion to the global economy by 2034.\n\nAccording to Akande, these impactful contributions will drive key industries such as manufacturing, utilities, professional and financial services, noting that several other fringe sectors will benefit immensely from the new technology.\n\n\u201cThe importance of 5G technology to the economies of nations cannot be overemphasised. It is therefore with a sense of fulfilment that we acknowledge the giant leap forward that today\u2019s auction represents.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a memorable milestone that Nigeria is set to auction Spectrum in the 3.5GHz for the deployment of 5G at this material time,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From a daily average of 74 cases seen in the first week of December, Nigeria\u2019s current Covid-19 cases have shot up by 451 percent to an average of 408, in a bout of infections driven by the latest Omicron variant.\n\nA total of 2,859 cases were confirmed in the week ended December 12, compared with 520 in the preceding week. Nigeria now has 217, 481 cases confirmed and 2, 981 deaths recorded across the federation.\n\nNigeria recorded its first three cases of omicron on December 1, days after it was first discovered in South Africa and has entered a travell ban tussle with some countries.\n\nThe rise, 75 percent led by Lagos, the epicentre of the disease, has activated the reality of the fourth wave of the disease in Nigeria, reliving a similar pattern of surge that played out this time last year.\n\nIn December 2020, Nigeria was pushed into a second wave of the pandemic by a sustained rise in community infections, claiming 1,197 lives.\n\nA new variant of COVID-19, lineage B.1.1.7 (Alpha), which cancelled Christmas in the UK, was found in Nigeria but after initial discovery in the UK.\n\nAbout 5, 618 new coronavirus cases had been recorded by the middle of the month, raising the total number of infections since the start of the pandemic to 73, 175 as of December 13.\n\nA fresh record of the highest daily cases was set December 13 with 796 infections, overtaking 790 cases set July 1st during the gradual easing of the two-month-long lockdown that affected the federal capital territory (FCT), Lagos and Ogun states.\n\nWhile intensified testing and surveillance at major points of entry reflects in the current infection rate, the World Health Organization says the variant reported in more than 60 countries, poses a very high global risk, with mutations likely leading to higher transmissibility.\n\nRead also: Lagos records more than half of Saturday\u2019s 612 COVID-19 infections, continues to top chart\n\nHowever, clinical data on its severity remains limited.\n\n\u201cThe overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high for a number of reasons,\u201d the WHO said in a technical brief issued on Sunday, reiterating its first assessment of Nov. 29.\n\nIt added there were early signs that vaccinated and previously infected people would not build enough antibodies to ward off infection from Omicron, resulting in high transmission rates and severe consequences.\n\nIt remains unclear for now whether the new lineage is also inherently more contagious than the dominant Delta variant, which would fuel its spread further, WHO warned.\n\nNigeria might be in a difficult situation if the virus turns violent as the slow vaccination rate has left the country lagging behind peers.\n\nThe country has only administered slightly over 9.6 million doses, with just 6.26 percent of its population covered, according to the African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDespite having over 21 million doses of vaccine supplies including AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna, the country suffers a 54.4 percent (11.5 million) gap in uptake.\n\nIronically, the federal government began to administer COVID-19 booster doses last Friday, raising public scrutiny of the country\u2019s vaccination plans.\n\nThis, amid a stock of vaccine supplies that is nowhere near adequate, and poor capacity for genomic surveillance nationwide underscores how ill-equipped the country is to tackle the latest COVID-19 strain if things escalate.\n\n\u201cThis virus is still mutating. Fortunately, so far, the information we have about the Omicron is that it is not so virulent. But we don\u2019t know what other variant will emerge. If a more virulent variant emerges, then we will be in trouble. So the best thing is to take precautions,\u201d Akin Osibogun, a professor of Public Health at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos told BusinessDay.",

          "text": "With MTN\u2019s move to sell 90 percent of its public offer of 575 million shares in Nigeria to retail investors, the telco giant is allowing individual investors to have a stake in one of the country\u2019s most profitable businesses at an attractive entry price.\n\nThe public offer is MTN\u2019s way of broadening its local shareholder base, thus providing the opportunity for as many Nigerians as possible to become shareholders in MTN Nigeria and share in the growth and value which the business creates.\n\nMTN\u2019s journey in Nigeria began in 2001 with a core group of Nigerian investors who provided the seed funding and who have been partners over the years, watching the business grow and thrive.\n\nIn this 20th year of its operation in Nigeria, in recognition of the part, Nigerians have played in the success story of the company in the country, MTN is expanding its ownership structure and is inviting Nigerians in every part of the country to join in on the next phase of its journey.\n\nRead also: Public Offer: MTN is no longer foreign, it is Nigerian \u2013 shareholders association\n\nMTN Nigeria\u2019s public offer, which is the first to be delivered digitally in Nigeria, is being sold to retail investors at N169 per share. The offer is the first from MTN since the 2019 listing on the Nigeria Exchange Limited (NGX) and the company seeks to take advantage of digital integration to ensure substantial participation from investors across Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nThe offer, which opened at 8:00 am on December 1, 2021, is expected to close at 5:00 pm on December 14, 2021, with a minimum subscription of 20 shares and lots of 20 shares thereafter. Subscribers are also offered one free share for every 20 shares they buy.\n\nGoing by the current market price of MTN Nigeria at about N175 per share, the N169 per share being offered to retail investors comes at a discount. MTN has made it possible for average Nigerians to own shares in MTN Nigeria with as low as N3,380, the price of 20 units of its shares at N169 per share. This is a rare opportunity that should not be missed.\n\nInvestment analysts have been stressing that the MTN public offer of 575 million shares is a \u201cGood Buy\u201d for investors seeking higher returns \u2013 in form of capital appreciation and dividend yield.\n\nResearch analysts at Coronation Asset Management believe MTN Nigeria\u2019s offer represents excellent value for investors. At the offer price, they said the shares trade at a Price/Earnings (PE) ratio of 11.6x their forecast of 2021 Profits After Tax, and a PE of just 9.1x their forecasts of 2022 Profits After Tax. The historic dividend yield for the stock, according to Coronation, is 5.5 percent and is expected to increase.\n\nWale Okunrinboye, an investment banker, said MTN is a solid company that has grown astronomically since it started in 2001 and is dominating the telecom space.\n\n\u201cIts demand is inelastic as people always need to communicate and so the product will always be in demand. Also, you don\u2019t have many players going into that space because the entry barriers are quite large,\u201d Okunrinboye said during a Nairametrics Clubhouse show, \u201dOn The Money\u201d series.\n\n\u201cAlso, in terms of growth prospect, asides from the increasing Nigerian population, there is also the increasing data consumption. Going forward, data consumption will increase even more as we go more digital. The revenue from data consumption continues to increase quarter after quarter,\u201d he said.\n\nThe implication of the move by MTN to allow retail investors to own a share of its Nigerian stocks is positive not just for the shares of the telco giant but for the entire stock market, according to a poll of 10 market analysts.\n\nAccording to these market analysts, the public offer will improve the liquidity of MTN shares on Nigerian Exchange Limited because it will be held by diverse investors. The capital market is also expected to benefit from the improved liquidity on the stock given it would be in the hands of many investors, thus aiding price discovery.\n\nThe liquidity of a market is one of the catalysts that attract foreign investors to an equities market like Nigeria\u2019s \u2013 the ability to enter into the market and leave whenever they deem fit.\n\n\u201cWe have always been clear about the future of the market \u2013 retail investors, wealth creation and capturing the larger demography of the Nigerian population leveraging technology,\u201d Temi Popoola, Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Exchange Limited, said at the recent Investor Forum by MTN to provide insights into MTN Nigeria\u2019s investment case, the public offer and business outlook.\n\n\u201cI encourage you to encourage everybody to key into this MTNN offer \u2013 it\u2019s a transaction that will revive the market,\u201d Popoola said.\n\nAs reflected in its massive CAPEX investment in the Nigerian franchise, MTN group is betting on Nigeria as one of its key markets, no wonder it was recently listed as a 2021 priority to \u201caccelerate Nigeria\u2019s growth\u201d.\n\nThe company, which extended its chief operating officer Jens Schulte-Bockum\u2019s contract by two years to 2024, said it was targeting 2021 capital expenditure of ZAR31.1 billion, up from a prior outlook of ZAR14.8 billion.\n\nHaving listed its Nigerian business in Lagos two years ago, MTN has become the second-largest stock by market capitalization on the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\nMTN\u2019s core profit jumped 24.1 percent in the three months to September on robust demand for data and digital financial services. It added 0.2 million subscribers during the quarter, taking the total to 271.9 million.\n\nNigeria is MTN\u2019s most profitable market, generating 32 percent (R57.9 million) of revenues; MTN South Africa generates about 25 per cent (45.4 million) of revenues. Nigeria\u2019s revenues for 2020 were up 14.6 percent.\n\nThe MTN Group also allocated 38 percent (12.64) of all CAPEX expenditure in FY 2020 to its Nigerian operations. Nigeria generates a humongous amount of cash for MTN Group, with cash generated at about 37 percent (ZAR17.23 billion), and also took on 37 percent (ZAR17.23 billion) of all reported Group debt.\n\nMTN is in the process of a strategic remake, tagged the \u201cAmbition 2025\u201d, that will see it focus squarely on Africa. The company wants to be the leading digital solution provider to drive African progress by 2025. This strategy will see the telco pivot from a \u201cproduct\u201d to a \u201cplatform\u201d player.\n\nThe company is expanding from traditional voice and data to digital via its Ayoba brand and FinTech via its MoMo brand.\n\nThe telco, with over 21,900 employees, was founded in South Africa in 1994. As of March 2021, MTN had 280 million subscribers in 21, including Nigeria.",
          "summary": "With MTN\u2019s move to sell 90 percent of its public offer of 575 million shares in Nigeria to retail investors, the telco giant is allowing individual investors to have a stake in one of the country\u2019s most profitable businesses at an attractive entry price.\nRead also: Public Offer: MTN is no longer foreign, it is Nigerian \u2013 shareholders associationMTN Nigeria\u2019s public offer, which is the first to be delivered digitally in Nigeria, is being sold to retail investors at N169 per share.\nInvestment analysts have been stressing that the MTN public offer of 575 million shares is a \u201cGood Buy\u201d for investors seeking higher returns \u2013 in form of capital appreciation and dividend yield.\nResearch analysts at Coronation Asset Management believe MTN Nigeria\u2019s offer represents excellent value for investors.\nAccording to these market analysts, the public offer will improve the liquidity of MTN shares on Nigerian Exchange Limited because it will be held by diverse investors.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS- President General of Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), Prince Adewale Adeyanju has decried the work attitude of the new Executive Secretary/Chief Executive of Nigeria Shippers Council (NSC) Hon Emmanuel Jime who was alleged of shunning the industry stakeholders since assumption.\n\nComrade Adeyanju spoke in an interview with journalists in Lagos, at the weekend alleged that since the assumption of the new NSC boss to office he has refused to engage with the industry stakeholders on ways to tackle the myriad of problems confronting the industry with the view of charting the way forward for the nation\u2019s maritime sector.\n\nHe cited the example of the reported invasion of the offices of some of the shipping companies in Lagos by the alleged officials of the Federal Consumers Competition Protection Commission (FCCPC) with heavily armed men, to explain why he so worried over how the Nigeria Shippers Council has abdicated its responsibilities in just few months that Barr. Hassan Bello, the immediate ES/CEO of the Council retired from service.\n\nAdeyanju said: \u201cThis development explains the issue I am raising about the new man at the Shippers\u2019 Council who is not meeting with stakeholders. If the invasion of the shipping companies\u2019 offices had taken place in the time of Hassan Bello you will see him in the forefront of the struggle to engage those invaders. He will be there.\u201d\n\nHe continued; \u201cWe have written to congratulate Emmanuel Jimmy on his appointment, and for a courtesy visit, but he has never deemed it fit to meet with the union so that we can advise him. Back to the question of the invasion of the shipping companies by the said government agency, nobody can enter your compound without due process. When that invasion occurred, we were taken aback with my team. We left this office around 8pm that day. When they came, they attacked Hull Blyte, Cosco and others to the extent that they invaded the shipping Line\u2019s servers.\n\n\u201cWe condemned that act no doubt, but a senior officer of the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (name withheld) called me and asked me where those government officials that invaded the shipping companies with heavily armed came from. My response to him was simple, you are the regulator, and you need to investigate them properly.\n\n\u201cWe, however, wrote to the new man at the Shippers\u2019 Council over the incident, but no response. So we felt we could handle it in our own style. We are watching the new ES. As a regulator of the port industry your door must be open to those you are regulating always. That is how it was in the time of Hassan Bello and that is why the industry is already missing him,\u201d he said.\n\nComrade Adeyanju further recalled with nostalgia the administration of Barr. Hassan Bello, saying, \u201cLeaders come and leaders go, what you do will also be on record and I am telling you today that we are missing somebody in the industry, somebody that has been an intermediary between maritime stakeholders whenever the need arises. When he was there we did not value his performances, we thought what the man was doing was not supposed to be his job but where are we now? I am talking about Alhaji Hassan Bello the former Executive Secretary, Nigeria Shippers\u2019 Council. We are missing him greatly within this short period that he has been retired.\n\n\u201cI am not trying to praise him, but the truth is that when Bello was the ES at the Shippers\u2019 Council, you will see him at the terminals. But now the council is not visible as it was during Bello. It\u2019s a fact whether you like it or not. Since his appointment, has he called any stakeholders meeting, how is he doing his job?\n\n\u201cTo us at MWUN we don\u2019t know if the Executive Secretary of Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council has been changed, all we know is that Hassan Bello is on leave and that is my word. The acting MD of NPA has been active, whenever there are issues with the terminal operators and if he is not available, he will send the Port Manager to liaise with us\u201d, he said.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) says the value of the country\u2019s green bonds market has grown to N55.52 billion between 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, NGX, Temi Popoola, disclosed this during the Sustainable Finance Training 2021, hosted by NGX in collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC).\n\nAccording to him, The Exchange is committed to fostering the growth of sustainable financial products, which integrate the financial risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental challenges.\n\nPopoola said Sub-Saharan Africa is the least responsible for global climate change but remains one of the most vulnerable to the risk posed by climate change.\n\nMaking reference to the World Meteorological Organization State of the Climate in Africa Report 2020, he noted that investment in climate adaptation for Sub-Saharan Africa would cost between $30 to $50 billion yearly over the next decade, or roughly two to three per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nHe revealed that the limited flow of climate finance remains a major issue for the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions in Africa particularly Nigeria.\n\nInvestment in climate adaptation for Sub-Saharan Africa would cost between $30 to $50 billion yearly over the next decade, or roughly two to three per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nHe continued: \u201cIn recognition of the climate finance needs particularly in Nigeria, and the urgent action required to combat climate change as well as its impact as enshrined in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, NGX in 2016 conceptualized and developed the Green Bond Product Paper, which was embraced and championed by the Debt Management Office, and the Federal Ministry of Environment.\n\n\u201cThis effort led to the issuance of the maiden N10.69 billion ($25.8 million) 13.48 per cent 5-year green bond in 2017, to fund projects to develop renewable energy. This was sequel to the ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement by the Federal Government of Nigeria, which necessitated the need for long term capital to fulfil Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ending gas flaring by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe second tranche, N15 billion ($36.1 million) 14.5 per cent 7-year Green Bond was issued in June 2019and was over-subscribed. The sovereign issuance paved way for corporate green bond market to emerge with N15 billion ($36.1 million) 15.5 per cent 5-year Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured Green Bond by Access Bank and N8.5 billion ($20.5 million) 15.6 per cent 15-year Guaranteed Fixed Rate Senior Green Infrastructure Bond by North South Power Company.\n\n\u201cOn 15 April 2021, North South Power Company (NSP) issued its second N6.33 billion ($15.3 million) 10-year 12 per cent Fixed Rate Series 2 Senior Green Bonds due 2031. It is noteworthy that all the corporate and sovereign Green Bonds are listed on NGX. These follow-on issuances have further increased investible instruments and deepened the Nigerian Green Bond market. It is noteworthy that the size of the Green Bond market is currently N55.52 billion ($133.8 million),\u201d Popoola said.\n\nHe reassured of NGX commitment to fostering the growth of sustainable financial products, which integrate the financial risks and opportunities associated with climate change and other environmental challenges.",

          "text": "A devastating swarm of tornadoes that tore a 200-mile path through the U.S. Midwest and South, demolishing homes, levelling businesses at the weekend, has resulted in the death of not less than 100 individuals in Kentucky.\n\nThe powerful twisters, which weather forecasters say are unusual in cooler months, destroyed a candle factory and the fire and police stations in a small town in Kentucky, ripped through a nursing home in neighboring Missouri, and killed at least six workers at an Amazon warehouse in Illinois, Reuters reported.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear said the collection of tornadoes was the most destructive in the state\u2019s history.\n\nAccording to him, about 40 workers had been rescued at the candle factory in the city of Mayfield, which had about 110 people inside when it was reduced to a pile of rubble. It would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d to find anyone else alive under the debris, Beshear said.\n\n\u201cThe devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life and I have trouble putting it into words,\u201d Beshear said at a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely going to be over 100 people lost here in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nBeshear said 189 National Guard personnel have been deployed to assist with the recovery. The rescue efforts will focus in large part on Mayfield, home to some 10,000 people in the southwestern corner of the state where it converges with Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas.\n\nVideo and photos posted on social media showed brick buildings in downtown Mayfield flattened, with parked cars nearly buried under debris. The steeple on the historic Graves County courthouse was toppled and the nearby First United Methodist Church partially collapsed.\n\nMayfield Fire Chief Jeremy Creason, whose own station was destroyed, said the candle factory was diminished to a \u201cpile of bent metal and steel and machinery\u201d and that responders had to at times \u201ccrawl over casualties to get to live victims.\u201d\n\nPaige Tingle said she drove four hours to the site in the hope of finding her 52-year-old mother, Jill Monroe, who was working at the factory and was last heard from at 9:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how to feel, we are just trying to find her,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster here.\u201d\n\nThe genesis of the tornado outbreak was a series of overnight thunderstorms, including a super cell storm that formed in northeast Arkansas. That storm moved from Arkansas and Missouri and into Tennessee and Kentucky.\n\nUnusually high temperatures and humidity created the environment for such an extreme weather event at this time of year, said Victor Gensini, a professor in geographic and atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University.\n\n\u201cThis is an historic, if not generational event,\u201d Gensini said.\n\nSaying the disaster was likely one of the largest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history, President Joe Biden on Saturday approved an emergency declaration for Kentucky.\n\nHe told reporters he would be asking the Environmental Protection Agency to examine what role climate change may have played in fuelling the storms, and he raised questions about the tornado warning systems.\n\n\u201cWhat warning was there? And was it strong enough and was it heeded?\u201d Biden said.",

Ethiopian just offloaded all passengers heading to Dubai. We are voiding Dubai bound tickets,\u201d the source said.\n\nThere has been no official communication from the UAE authorities on the latest development.\n\nDaily Trust had earlier reported how many Nigerian passengers were stranded over the Emirates logjam.\n\nA passenger, who was to travel via an Emirates flight on Monday, had to explore an alternative airline, paying over N500,000 to travel via Lufthansa.\n\nAmong those stranded are businessmen, students and others said to be going for medical reasons.\n\n\u201cI had to book another flight on Lufthansa travelling through Brazil just to connect Dubai because the various restrictions across the world have made travel very difficult for everybody because you have to travel via a destination, not on the red list.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I must be in Dubai by all means and that has cost me an extra N500,000. How many people can afford this,\u201d a student who preferred anonymity, said.\n\nThe Vice-President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Abuja Zone, Ambassador Adeshola Kayode, lamented that millions of naira have been lost and businesses affected as a result of the current imbroglio.\n\n\u201cWe have lost millions, clients have started requesting refunds and some of these tickets are not refundable and for those that have refunds, it will take time to process,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the federal government\u2019s decision was a welcome development to protect the sovereignty and integrity of the country.\n\nA former president of the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), Engr. Isaac Balami, said Emirates and other foreign airlines should begin to respect Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey should begin to take us seriously. When we didn\u2019t fly into the country, we did not die. They must begin to respect Africa, most importantly Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI commend the minister and the DG for this bold step and I pray that we will continue in that trajectory, not just Emirates but any other person who will not respect and honour Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen Emirates solves the problem and makes Air Peace happy, we will also make them happy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

While each country is entitled to put in place measures to protect its citizens. Nigeria has similar responsibilities. However, based on existing relationships, Nigeria has initiated diplomatic steps to make these countries reverse their course. This is on-going in the interest of all parties concerned and we expect that positive results would emerge within the next one week.\n\n\u201cThe PSC also evaluated the developments on the relationship between Nigeria and the UAE and we are pleased to inform you that the position of the federal government is in line with established ICAO protocols and the spirit of the BASA signed with the UAE. Our sovereignty remains paramount and mutual respects shall be our guiding principle in as much as it should be in the best interest of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe PSC will at its next regular briefing on Monday, December 20, 2021 brief you fully on developments.\u201d\n\nPart of the media report had quoted the minister of Aviation as saying that \u201cthere is a case of Saudi Arabia, which put Nigeria on the banned list \u2013 no visa, no travel, et Cetra.

So, today (Saturday) there was a meeting, I participated in a zoom meeting, COVID-19 task force, just for your information also.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have given our input in aviation, it is not acceptable by us and we recommend that those countries be also put on red list, as they did similarly to us.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t allow our citizens to go into their countries who are their airlines coming to pick from our country?\n\n\u201cSo, I am very sure that in the next few days, between now and Monday, or perhaps Tuesday, at maximum, all those countries will be put on the red list from the PSC (Presidential Steering Committee) from the task force of COVID-19.

While each country is entitled to put in place measures to protect its citizens. Nigeria has similar responsibilities. However, based on existing relationships, Nigeria has initiated diplomatic steps to make these countries reverse their course. This is on-going in the interest of all parties concerned and we expect that positive results would emerge within the next one week.\n\n\u201cThe PSC also evaluated the developments on the relationship between Nigeria and the UAE and we are pleased to inform you that the position of the federal government is in line with established ICAO protocols and the spirit of the BASA signed with the UAE. Our sovereignty remains paramount and mutual respects shall be our guiding principle in as much as it should be in the best interest of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe PSC will at its next regular briefing on Monday, December 20, 2021 brief you fully on developments.\u201d\n\nPart of the media report had quoted the minister of Aviation as saying that \u201cthere is a case of Saudi Arabia, which put Nigeria on the banned list \u2013 no visa, no travel, et Cetra. So also Canada. So, today (Saturday) there was a meeting, I participated in a zoom meeting, COVID-19 task force, just for your information also.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have given our input in aviation, it is not acceptable by us and we recommend that those countries be also put on red list, as they did similarly to us.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t allow our citizens to go into their countries who are their airlines coming to pick from our country?\n\n\u201cSo, I am very sure that in the next few days, between now and Monday, or perhaps Tuesday, at maximum, all those countries will be put on the red list from the PSC (Presidential Steering Committee) from the task force of COVID-19. Once they are put on the red list, which means they are banned, of course, their airlines will be banned.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry, we are going through a difficult moment, but we have to do it in the interest of our country.\u201d",

Suleiman Adamu, called on Nigerians, especially the communities through which the roads pass, to take ownership and protect the roads\n\nAccording to him, they \u201chave been built to the highest quality of design and workmanship\u201d in order to enable them to last their designed lifespan.\n\nHe described the commissioned roads as \u201cpart of our many roads to prosperity\u201d, told Nigerians, \u201cNow that we have this new and well-built road, we have duties to ourselves and to other road users\u201d, listing such duties to include avoiding abuse of the roads and compliance with the nation\u2019s traffic laws as stipulated in the Highway Code.\n\nAccording to the President, abuse of the roads could take the form of overloading of vehicles and trucks which accelerates pavement damage, spilling of petroleum products, and converting the road shoulders to permanent parking places, which brings the onset of road failure from the shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe must all do our best to avoid these practices, report them when they occur and act in a lawful manner to stop them\u201d, the President said.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, for the avoidance of any doubt, I wish to reiterate that the maximum driving speed on this and other Federal Highways nationwide is 100 (ONE HUNDRED) KM and no more\u201d.\n\nBuhari paid tribute to the patriotism of the Nigerians who participated directly or indirectly in the construction of the roads.\n\n\u201cThese are not only nation builders to whom we offer our salutations, they are the heart of the Nigerian economy, the micro, small and medium enterprises that drive our economic growth\u201d, he said.\n\nIn his own remarks, the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, SAN, said the Season of Completion and Impact was a clear affirmation of the presence of the progressive administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nFashola, who was represented at the event by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mr Babangida Hussaini, said the road projects represented a major investment in road transport infrastructure.\n\nThe Minister expressed gratitude to all investors in the first and second SUKUK bond which funding helped in the completion of Azare \u2013 Potiskum, Shuwarin \u2013 Potiskum and Sokoto-Tambuwal- Kontagora Roads.\n\nMeanwhile, Fashola said that the SUKUK funding is currently contributing to the progress of work on 44 roads across Nigeria which would also be commissioned and handed over as and when completed.\n\nIn addition, he thanked the Ministry of Finance, and the members of the National Assembly, \u201cespecially the Chairmen of the Senate and House Committees on Works in the 8th and 9th Assembly as well as the Debt Management Office\u201d.\n\n\u201cI cannot fail to acknowledge the cooperation of the host communities where these projects pass through or are hosted. I hold them out as examples of what peace can achieve, and the investments that collaboration and some sacrifice can deliver if we embrace partnership with Government\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, the Emir of Dutse, His Royal Highness, Dr Nuhu Sanusi said the importance of the road could not be over-emphasized, as \u201cit covers about five states\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the heart of the economic activities, our gratitude to the Federal Government is deep for making this possible\u201d the Emir added.",

          "title": "Tinubu Was Never Promised Running Mate Position, Buhari\u2019s Boys Fire Back at Ex-Party Chair Akande \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "The last may not have been heard of some of the revelations in the newly published autobiography by a former governor of Osun State and erstwhile protem national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, who claimed in his book, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, that President Muhammadu Buhari, reneged in his promise to make a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, his running mate ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nBut many of Buhari\u2019s close allies and foot soldiers, who were privy to some of the negotiations and horse-trading that preceded the 2015 elections, dismissed the account by Akande as being twisted and far from the truth, because according to them, \u201cBuhari truly and only promised Tinubu a workable partnership, which included conceding the vice presidential slot to the South-west as a bloc, not to exactly make him his running mate.\u201d\n\nA lot of the Buhari boys, on Sunday, called THISDAY with respect to its lead story last Friday, titled: \u2018Akande: Buhari Promised to Pick Tinubu as Running Mate in 2015, Then Reneged,\u2019 which was an extract from Akande\u2019s autobiography, saying they were dismayed over the report and strongly disagreed with the author\u2019s account of events.\n\nAccording to them, all that Buhari said was that he was going to partner and work with Tinubu, in the context of a partnership between the South-west and North-west, reiterating that the president never promised Tinubu vice president or running mate, contrary to claims by Akande in the book.\n\nThis, the sources, who often glibly referred to themselves as Buhari\u2019s boys, added was because they recognised \u201cthe role Tinubu played in helping them and the role of the South-west for voting en bloc during the convention that produced Buhari, which was pivotal and he presented the vice presidential slot in the partnership.\n\n\u201cAnd, in all of this, what Akande did not disclose was that Buhari sent a delegation of Farouk Ahmed, Hadi Sirika and Sarki Abba, to meet Tinubu and explained to him that the Muslim-Muslim ticket would not work, but that they would be partners to work together.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari boys, have however, concluded that the former Osun governor appeared to have taken up the task of \u201ca political bull, trying to force Buhari\u2019s hands to support Tinubu in 2023. But that, we will not accept, even though no one is opposed to his aspiration.\u201d\n\nThey maintained that Chief Akande\u2019s account was deliberately slanted, to not only make Tinubu look good and weep up sentiment for him, but also send the president on a guilt trip and compel him to side with the former Lagos governor, who has shown keen interest, albeit clandestinely, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn the THISDAY lead report of Friday, which detailed how Akande, in his autobiography, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed that Buhari, apparently under pressure from certain interests and forces, dropped Tinubu from running with him on the party\u2019s ticket, concluded that the then candidate of APC reneged on the agreement they had even after the merger had been sealed.\n\nIn the book, launched in Lagos, Akande, who also took a swipe at some Yoruba leaders including former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Chief Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, claimed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his running mate, Buhari later faltered, saying he only wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner withhim.\u201d\n\nHis account stated thus: \u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket? I thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter, when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe, however, expressed surprise that, when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari would pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019 Oyegun said. He apologised. I didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that.\n\n\u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes!\u201d\n\nAkande further said some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running mate, a move himself and former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiohmhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiohmhole, then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u201cDid we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know later that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket, and that it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting, which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u201cGeneral, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership.\n\n\u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered.\n\n\u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "text": "The Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has expressed concern over the delay by President Muhammadu Buhari in assenting to the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him by the National Assembly last month.\n\nThis is just as civil society organisations (CSOs) have written formally to the president urging him to assent to the Electoral Biil as his birthday gift on December 17, when he will be a year older.\n\nAlso, representative of the Center for Socio-Legal Studies (CSLS) and expert in Electoral Law and Justice, Dr. Akin Oluwadayisi, have said Buhari signing the bill into law, would not only make history but would have succeeded in enthroning himself as the \u201cfather of true internal democracy.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for the president to sign the bill into law or risk an override by the National Assembly expires this week.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, told THISDAY on Sunday that PANDEEF as a responsible organisation stands for anything that would improve the nation\u2019s electoral process.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe want free, fair and credible elections in the country, 2023 and beyond. Where the votes of citizens would truly decide who gets elected at any level in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAnyone, who for whatever reason, solicits the President not to sign the Bill is doing a great disservice to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPANDEF, therefore, calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to jettison partisan considerations and assent to the bill without further delay, to strengthen the nation\u2019s democracy\u201d.\n\nOn their part, CSOs under the aegis of the Civil Society Partners on Electoral Reform (CiSPER) and other concerned groups have written to President Buhari, urging him to invite representatives of youths, women, People Living with Disabilities and CSOs as well to the signing ceremony of Electoral Bill on his birthday.\n\nThe CSOs in the letter entitled \u201cElectoral Bill: Invite Representatives of Youths, Women, PLWD and CSOs to the Signing Ceremony,\u201d dated 11th December, 2021, expressed optimism that Buhari would sign the Electoral Amendment bill into law as he celebrates on his birthday.\n\nThe organisations stated that they were encouraged by Buhari\u2019s statement at the virtual summit on democracy organised by President Joe Biden of the United States that he would ensure elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner.\n\nThey also said the invitation to grace the electoral bill signing ceremony would go a long way in assuring Nigerians and the International community of his commitment to inclusive participation in our democratic process.\n\nAccording to the CSOs, a new Electoral Act would help to put in place necessary legal framework to build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values.\n\nThe letter read in part, \u201cAs the clock ticks, we are increasingly assured that you will side with the people and act in the overriding public interest to give your assent to the electoral bill as a legacy for deepening electoral reforms and strengthening our democracy.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know, Mr. President, that the Biden administration is already facing some criticism for its guest list for the virtual summit, and Nigeria is fingered as one of the \u2018nations with spotty records on democracy, the rule of law and human rights,\u2019 as reported the CNN and other global media.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that you used the occasion to state unequivocally that democratic rule in the West African sub-region \u201cis currently being threatened by undemocratic takeover of government by the military.\u201d\n\nThe CSLS\u2019 position was contained in a press statement dated December 12, 2021 and made available to journalists.\n\n\u201cThe current Electoral Amendment Bill before the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for assent demands immediate and urgent assent in the interest of the electorates and entrenchment of parties\u2019 internal democracy.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, Section 14(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) declares that sovereignty belongs to the people of Nigeria from whom government itself derives all its powers and authority. And it is through the direct participation in political parties\u2019 primaries that the participation by the people in their governments shall be ensured.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries deny them this right of grassroot participation\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nThe law expert who remarked that political parties over the years had failed to allow direct election of delegates when primaries are conducted, argued that if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was given the powers to supervise the process, it would not only ensure credibility but also build confidence of the people in the future general elections that will be conducted.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s will also be breaking the jinx governorship godfatherism and perhaps, father true internal democracy from political party level if he assents to the Bill.\n\n\u201cThe governors of states in Nigeria have been tested with the required true democratic involvement of local governments but failed through selfish interest, dominating control and financial manipulation of the local government authority,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, allowing indirect primaries into the legislative bodies is to further empower the governors to play the role of gods in determining the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, good governance and sacrifice direct participation of the electorates\u2019 desires.\n\nOluwadayisi stressed that the bill would benefit the political parties, especially the ruling party more in that when the party members are given the freedom to choose active and responsive legislators, their performances and delivery will go a long way to promote the party\u2019s image and collective interest of the people who have chosen them.\n\nHe noted further that major countries of the world including the United States where Nigeria borrowed the presidential system of government no longer practice indirect form of primaries for selection of candidates as voters can directly vote and determine the top candidates who will advance to the general election.\n\n\u201cThe presidential assent to the bill is the adoption of the ideal form of democratic practice now being practice by developed nations of the world that the nation emulates,\u201d he added.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Alex Enumah, Udora Orizu in Abuja",
