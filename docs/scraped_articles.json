          "title": "2023: Guber aspirant unveils 8 point agenda \u2018to change fortunes of Kano\u2019",
          "text": "By Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nA governorship aspirant under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano, Engr. Bashir Ishaq Bashir has unveiled eight (8) points agenda to turn around the fortunes of Kano State.\n\nEngr. Bashir who was a former gubernatorial candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Movement, PDM, in the 2019 election stated this while declaring his intention to join the 2023 governorship race in the state under the APC.\n\nHe berated the successive government in the state, especially Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje\u2019s administration for what he described as the state is witnessing retrogression under his watch.\n\nHe hinted that if given the mandate in the 2023 election, he will declare a state of emergency in the sectors of agriculture, education, and health among others to restore the lost glories of the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPerhaps more than ever before and at any other time in its checkered history, Kano State is today desperately yearning for a competent and effective leader capable of addressing the myriad of challenges that have collectively stultified its development across all sectors. These challenges that perennially beset the state cut across all sectors, spanning from education, economic development, healthcare delivery, agriculture and associated industries, social security, insecurity and the rule of law, amongst others.\n\n\u201cThe glorious days of Kano State as an acknowledged agricultural and commercial centre and industrial hub of note, second only to Lagos State, is all now in the past, with many of its defining characteristics all gone, arising mainly from years of neglect by some successive administrations. This continuing neglect of vital sectors of the economy has combined with the continuing rising population over the years to deliberately relegate Kano State to the bottom in virtually all economic development indices.\n\n\u201cThe priority of our recent leadership is to develop Kano into a megacity with mega impoverished people. Massive investments are being made on projects that have little or no bearing on the economic development of the people. Projects that do not generate revenue, projects that have no direct economic bearing on the common man. Projects that are centred only in the city, neglect the vast populace of our rural areas. It beats the imagination of every right-thinking person how an orphan or a widow will spend the whole day under the scorching sun going up and down an N8bn flyover bridge begging for ten or twenty Naira to put food in their stomachs. It is hard to reconcile the fact that a state government faced with 3 million out of school children, a government that has virtually all its primary and secondary healthcare facilities perpetually on life support, a government that has 85 % of its primary and secondary schools underfunded and undereducated will have the effrontery to budget twenty per cent of its budget on road projects.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the reality of the existence of these long-standing development challenges and the imperative of comprehensively addressing them, with a view to taking the state back to its rightful place across all development indices, it is necessary that capable, right and focused leadership is put in place to drive the desired paradigm shift in the quest for a Kano that will be self-sufficient in food production and economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cOver the years, our leadership selection process, just like in many other states across the nation, has not been deliberately targeted at getting the right fit for the job. This has resulted in situations whereby many intending leaders having no capacity to lead, absolutely no blueprint, no focus, and with a tunnel vision of what leadership entails, often end up getting (s)elected to leadership positions with absolutely no idea of the needs and wants of the people of the state. This results into elected Governors whose ONLY ambition and quest is to be Governor and enjoy the perks of being in office and feed their egos on the power that comes with being a Governor, and of course the constant access to public till.\n\n\u201cThe forthcoming 2023 general elections has, once again, provided the state and its electorate with another opportunity to take the necessary steps to make a bold statement in choosing its leadership for the times we live today. A situation whereby our leadership selection continues to churn charlatans and mediocre has failed us many times over in the past, and now. Any aspirant that splashes money or has unexplained sources of wealth should not even dream of vying for the numero uno seat in Kano State. Any aspiring candidate who cannot clearly and concisely explain the What, the How, the When has no business asking for your votes. Any aspirant who cannot explicitly and in a plain language lay before you his vision, plan of action, deliverables and timeline, his proposed team that will help him in both decision making and implementation processes, has no business talking to you. Kano needs a leader with vision and focus. Someone with a passion for service to humanity. Someone who will take charge and be in charge. Someone with the right dose of guts and intuition. Someone who is educated and applies it. Someone with the chasm and charisma that the Kano people will be proud to call their Governor.\n\n\u201cAs a trained engineer and project manager, I recognize the importance of infrastructure. On the other hand, as a manager of resources, prioritization, opportunity cost, and scale of preference should be the guiding principle for any elected Governor, especially in Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe shall declare a state of emergency on all sectors, spanning from education, economic development, healthcare delivery, agriculture and associated industries, social security, insecurity and the rule of law, amongst others. We shall strive to be among the top three states in terms of GDP and per capita income in six years. We shall turnaround the fortunes of Kano from a consumer economy to an active production hub,\u201d Engr. Bashir however stated.",

Many of us these days have most of our communication on WhatsApp and the company keeps bringing in new features and updates to make that experience easier and more enjoyable.\n\nNow, WhatsApp seems to be working on what may be the solution to one of the biggest problems on the instant messaging app. According to a report from WhatsApp tracker WABetaInfo, the company is working on letting users text those numbers that are not saved on their smartphones.\n\nWhatsApp does not allow us to send messages to numbers that aren\u2019t saved on our smartphones. However, the WhatsApp beta for Android version 2.22.8.11 shows that the company is working on a solution for this. The report shows that tapping on an unsaved number that has been sent on a chat will open an in-app menu that allows users to chat with the person if they are on WhatsApp. The in-app menu also allows users to call these unsaved numbers and give them an option to save the contact. Android Authority verified the report, saying that the beta version they are running shows the said in-app menu.\n\nCurrently, tapping on a number that was sent to you on WhatsApp opens the phone\u2019s dialer app. The new method, while being a big change towards allowing you to text unsaved contacts, isn\u2019t perfect yet. It will still require the unsaved number to be on your WhatsApp.\n\nThe Meta-owned instant messaging platform was also recently reported to be putting a new limit on message forwards. Both the Android and iOS beta versions of WhatsApp showed an upcoming feature that will not let users forward a message to more than one group at a time. If a user tries to forward an already forwarded message to another group, they will be met with an alert that says \u201cForwarded messages can only be sent to one group chat.\u201d\n\nSource: NewsTech\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He said whenever he has money, what hits him is the idea for turnover.\n\nAccording to him, as a businessman, you must be creative, and you must not stop thinking on how to break new grounds.\n\n\u201d People think that in this part of the world, young people cannot get engaged in business and be genuinely successful. But I think we\u2019re beginning to change that narrative.\n\n\u201cI was into sales and distribution of wine at AUCHI poly where I was a student. I was one of the major suppliers of premium wine in the school and I was known for being genuine for supplying those wines. And I made money. I mean good money. So youths should be encouraged to genuinely do their business instead of. If you work hard, you will definitely make it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m into different ventures. In fact, during the lockdown for COVID-19, we survived through fishery and poultry. Since I came into this city ( Abuja) I have sealed great deals in the estate business. Right now, I\u2019m trying to diversify further. I\u2019m moving into nightlife business. After seeking the opinion of my very good friend and elder brother, Uyi Ogbebor, I feel it\u2019s time to delve into nightlife. I have been into sales and distribution of premium wine since my school days, and I believe a combination of that and other factors will blend me into the nightlife business. Myself, Sir Uyi and other friends are working to set up another club here in Abuja, and very-very soon, Abuja will hear from us.\n\nI advise young people to take seriously what they do. Commitment and tenacity of purpose have pushed me to this very level today. You don\u2019t need to manipulate people to actualize your dream. With dedication and commitment, you can change your life story,\u201d he said.\n\nEdoh is looking to partner with like-minds in a 5 million dollars investment in nightlife and entertainment industry.",

          "title": "Mixed reactions as PDP throws presidential ticket open",
          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu, Chinelo Obogo, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nIndications emerged, last night that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has resolved to jettison zoning in deciding the nomination of its presidential candidate for the 2023 poll.\n\nThe 37-man zoning committee headed by Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, took the decision at a meeting held at the Benue State Government Lodge in Abuja.\n\nMultiple sources privy to discussion at the meeting said the committee resolved: \u201c(1)Zoning, as in our party constitution, is affirmed; (2) In spite of (1) above, ticket is thrown open this time around due to exigency of time. Our party is encouraged to always make the issue of zoning very clear at least six months before sales of forms. Our party should commend the efforts of some our contestants on the issue of consensus candidacy; the efforts should be seen to a peaceful and logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nZoning has been causing ripples in the party since March 2021 when the committee on the review of the 2019 general elections headed by Bauchi State Governor recommended that it should be thrown open to all qualified aspirants. The PDP NEC at a meeting last Month set up a 37-man committee to resolve the issue.\n\nOrtom, who refused to take questions nor disclose resolution of the panel said all members of the committee were unanimous in their decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve unanimously adopted a position that will be sent to the NEC of our party that appointed us. The good news for our teeming supporters of the PDP and Nigerians is that we have resolved and everyone of us, the 37 members unanimously adopted the position that we are going to present to NEC.\u201d\n\nAs members of the committee emerged from the meeting, many of them from the South wore long faces while their counterparts from the North beamed with smiles.\n\nWith the decision of the panel to throw the contest open, the coast is now clear for all the presidential aspirants, who have obtained the PDP nomination forms to contest in the presidential primary scheduled for May 28 and 29.\n\nHowever, it was not certain as at press time when the party\u2019s NEC would meet to consider the report of the committee.\n\nWhen contacted, the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) was yet to receive the report. He explained that immediately it does, machinery would be put in place to convene NEC meeting to ratify report.\n\nThose who have obtained nomination forms include Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, Akwa Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation( SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim. Others are former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former senate president, Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Oliver Diana Teriela; Nwachukwu Anakwenze; Ovation Publisher, Dele Mohammed, Sam Ohuabunwa and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\n\u2022We\u2019ll not relent\n\n\u2013Ohanaeze\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo has said it was not dampened by the decision to throw it open as it was hopeful a Southeasterner would clinch it at the end.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said Ohanaeze would continue to lobby the party.\n\n\u201cThey said they are throwing it open but we cannot stop lobbying them to see how they will understand that it is the turn of the Igbo. Even when APC is talking about South, we cannot stop in our efforts to continue to talk to their hearts to understand, it is a struggle that will continue. It is not a struggle you embark on and stop, it has a ripple effect now and after, so we have to be consistent in it. Even after the election, the struggle will continue that this is Igbo position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still lobbying, we are still speaking to Nigerians trying to convince them on the need for us to have an Igbo as President for peace and unity of the country, because when there is no peace and unity there can\u2019t be progress, there can\u2019t be what you call development. Sustainable national development cannot come when you don\u2019t have peace and unity and the bases of that that peace and unity is equity, fairness and justice. When you have justice, then you have peace and unity and sustainable development is a product of peace and unity, that is what we are saying.\u201d\n\n\u2022We\u2019ll campaign against northern candidate \u2013MBF\n\nMiddle Belt Forum (MBF) vowed to campaign against against any political party that fields a northerner as its presidential candidate.\n\nIts President, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, said they have principles and would always stand by them regardless of who is involved. He said the country has had a president from the North for eight years and it was only fair that power should return to the Southern part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have been very consistent in our clamour for a president from the South and we have not changed our stance. President Muhammadu Buhari is from the north and he has ruled for eight years, so, this time around, the presidency should go to the South.\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear that the Middle Belt Forum has resolved to campaign against any political party that elects a presidential candidate from the north to contest the 2023 election. We will campaign against such a person and that is our final decision.\u201d\n\n\u2022You\u2019ve buried your votes \u2013 Southern youths\n\nThe Southern Nigeria Ethnic Youth Leaders Assembly (SNEYLA) said the decision would cost the party votes in the South East and South South.\n\nThe group gave PDP seven days to reconsider ceding PDP presidential tickets to South East or be ready to bear the grevious consequences of such injustice and marginalisation against Southeasteners.\n\nAccording to a statement by its National President, Felix Worlu: \u201cPDP has murdered sleep and they wouldn\u2019t sleep again in Southern Nigeria until the party is finally buried. There\u2019s no reason any PDP office/flag from ward level to state will be in the Southern Nigeria if they dare to deny a southeastern PDP president ticket.\n\n\u201cBy throwing PDP president ticket open, PDP has murdered justice, fairness and equity. Therefore, Southern Nigeria Ethnic Youth Leaders Assembly Shall apply every political means both conventional and unconventional to send a signal to PDP from the day of primary if they deny South East presidential Aspirants ticket\u2026PDP by their actions want to destroy Nigeria Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe built and the Nigeria General Yakubu Gowon fought for in 1967/70.\u201d\n\n\u2022Decision unfortunate, shameful \u2013Kokori\n\nFormer secretary general of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers Union (NUPENG), Chief Frank Kokori, described the decision as unfortunate and shameful.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a shame if the southern governors don\u2019t unite against this decision. You see, I don\u2019t want a situation where a northern Muslim would be contesting against a southern Christian because Nigeria is in a bad shape and people will think it is a war situation. We are not yet ripe for that kind of arrangement considering our multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual differences.\n\n\u201cSo, it is unfortunate that the PDP has to go that way to shortchange the southerners who have been their main source of support for years. The southern people have virtually given more than 90 percent support to the PDP at every election year. So, it is for the southern PDP members to look at it critically and know what to do. But, I think they are being marginalised and if they don\u2019t know that they are being marginalised, then it is unfortunate for them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Decision self-destruct \u2013 Uwazurike\n\nFormer President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike said the move was not only a betrayal of the established norm, but a clear indication that the party was working to destroy itself.\n\n\u201cWhat the PDP did is a betrayal. It was the same thing they did in 2015 when they worked against former President Goodluck Jonathan. If they want to do the same thing in 2023 by not zoning the presidential ticket to the South, we shall see how the votes will go.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ilemona, Afegbua clash\n\nA PDP member from the North Central, Ilemona Onoja, said the decision would enable the party to present the most competent candidate who can win election for the party.\n\nHowever, former commissioner in Edo State, Kassim Afegbua said if the party has decided to go against zoning which is in its constitution, it equally has to remove zoning from its constitution to avoid litigation in future.\n\n\u201cOut of 62 years since independence, the north has ruled for 48 years while the south has only ruled for 14 years, so where is the equity, justice and fairness that some people are talking about,\u201d he argued.",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja and Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nBarely a week after terrorists killed eight and kidnapped scores of passengers aboard an Abuja-Kaduna-bound train, no fewer than 12 soldiers and three vigilante were feared killed, while 20 were injured in a fresh attack on a military base in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe terrorists believed to be over 200 had stormed the military base with heavy artillery gun fire and destroyed three Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) and overpowering troops stationed there.\n\nA source said the terrorists who wielded AK-47 and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) stormed the military base on motorcycles. He said the confrontation with soldiers lasted for about two hours before the soldiers were eventually subdued.\n\n\u201cWe lost 12 men while 20 soldiers were wounded in action. They also burnt down three armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) after they overwhelmed the troops. They also carted away several weapons from the troops,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe attack, it was learnt, has thrown the 1 Division of the Nigerian Army in Kaduna into confusion.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that while the 19 soldiers injured were rushed to the General Hospital, Birnin Gwari, the remains of the 12 soldiers were deposited at the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital, Kaduna.\n\nA military officer told Daily Sun that the attackers came from Shiroro in Niger State which has become a hot bed for terrorists. He said the attack has left the military devastated as the authority was thinking of how to break the news to families who lost soldiers during the attack.\n\nHe said Birnin Gwari, which used to be a hideout for bandits and other kidnappers, had been calm with heavy deployment of troops, until Monday night attack.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was no official statement from the police, army and the Kaduna State government on the attack.\n\nDirector, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, could not be reached as he is was said to have travelled with the Chief of Army Staff to the North East theatre of operations.\n\nHowever, a statement by the Chairman of the Birnin Gwari Emirate Progressive Union (BEPU), Ishaq Usman Kasai, confirmed the death of three vigilante, saying the attack took place around 3pm on Sunday.\n\nHe said the attackers were members of the Ansaru who are believed to have come in from Niger State.\n\n\u2018\u2019When we heard of it, we had to run and seek refuge elsewhere. Most of the residents slept outside Birnin Gwari town.\u201d\n\nHe said normalcy returned, yesterday, around 10am, describing the Kaduna /Birnin Gwari as the most dangerous road in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the army has said the volatile and complex security emergencies facing the nation has necessitated the continuous review of the national security architecture to contain the threats.\n\nChief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, made this known at the opening of a seminar on Intensifying Warriors Ethos, in Abuja.\n\nHe was represented by the Chief Of Policy and Plans (COPP), Major General Anthony Omozodje.\n\nThe COAS said the varied acts of insurgency, terrorism, kidnapping, banditry and other terrorist organisations have continued to pose substantive threats to the nation, but assured that troops have continued to \u201crespond assiduously to contain and decimate all adversaries of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nYahaya said the seminar put together by the Department Of Transformation and Innovation was aimed at boosting the fighting spirit of personnel deployed in the North East and other operational theatres across Nigeria.\n\nEarlier in his address, the Chief of Transformation and Innovation, Major General Charles Ofoche, said the seminar was organised to brainstorm and proffer practicable ways of imbibing warrior ethos in troops which encompasses the will, zeal and spirit to fight to the end. He said the re-invigoration of the fighting will is essential to building a formidable 21st Century Army.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has threatened to disqualify any political party that fails to adhere strictly to regulations and guidelines for the conduct of primaries for the 2023 general elections.\n\nIt also warned that should any political party fail to comply with the provisions regulating the conduct of any of its primaries, its candidates shall be excluded in the election for the particular position.\n\nThe commission gave the advice in a statement, yesterday, by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye.\n\n\u201cThe commission wishes to reiterate that parties must adhere strictly to the principles of internal democracy, drawing from their constitutions, guidelines, the Electoral Act and other regulations and guidelines issued by the commission. Their candidates for the 1,491 constituencies for which elections will be conducted in 2023 must emerge from democratic, transparent and valid primaries in line with the provisions of sections 29 and 84 of the Electoral Act, 2022. Where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of the Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue. As required by law, the commission shall monitor the primaries of each political party that provides the required legal notice in line with sections 82 (1) and (5) of the Electoral Act,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye said the failure of a political party to notify the commission of any convention or congress convened for the purpose of nominating candidates for any of the elective offices specified in the Act shall render the convention or congress invalid.\n\nHe said primaries must be conducted in the various constituencies as provided in Section 84 of the Electoral Act and that it was a violation of the law to conduct primaries outside the constituencies for which parties are nominating candidates.\n\n\u201cThe commission will not monitor such primaries and their outcome will not be accepted. Political parties are enjoined to avoid acrimonious primaries that could result in unnecessary litigations that may lead to failure to nominate and field candidates for elections in some constituencies.\u201d\n\nOkoye said on Saturday February 26, INEC released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe said the timetable provided detailed activities, including the conduct of primaries, nomination of candidates by political parties and other activities leading to the presidential and National Assembly elections on Saturday Feb. 25, 2023, followed by the governorship and State Assembly elections on Saturday March 11, 2023.\n\nOkoye said all the activities were in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\u201cSo far, two out of the 14 activities in the timetable and schedule of activities have been successfully accomplished. The Notice of Election was published on Feb. 28, while nomination forms have been made available on the commission\u2019s website since March 1 for political parties to download and issue to their candidates. The next activity is the conduct of primaries by political parties in line with the dictates of Section 84 of the Electoral Act for which the Timetable and Schedule of Activities provides a period of 61 days (April 4 to June 3),\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroluem Company Ltd, Mele Kyari, is seeking the support of the National Association of Petroleum and Engineering Gas Workers, the National Association of Road Transport Owners and other stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to tackle the issue of crude oil theft in the Niger Delta region.\n\nKyari gave this indication on Tuesday at the 5th quadrennial delegates conference holding in Asaba, Delta State.\n\nThe conference with theme, \u201cJust Energy Transition: For oil and gas workers social welfare and security\u201d was attended by the Minister of Labour and Employment Dr Chris Ngige, who was represented by the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress Ayuba Wabba; Governor of Delta State who was represented by his Deputy Kingsley Otuaru and the Group Executive Director (Upstream), NNPC Ltd, Adokiye Tombomieye among other senior government officials.\n\nCrude oil theft has been having a negative impact on the revenue of the Federal Government, a worrisome development that is denying the country the much-needed funding to boost economic development.\n\nApart from loss of revenue, oil theft is currently threatening not only the NNPC\u2019s quest for energy security for the country, but also leaving a debilitating effect on Nigeria\u2019s foriegn exchange earnings.\n\nA report recently released at a meeting on crude oil theft between the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission and Oil Producers Trade Section, as well as the Independent Petroleum Producers Group, showed that between January 2021 and February 2022, Nigeria lost a whopping of $3.2billion to crude oil theft.\n\nThe amount when converted at the official exchange rate of N416.25 to a dollar exchange rate translates to about N1.36trillion.\n\nThe report revealed that oil theft rose significantly between 2021 and 2022, with over 90 per cent of total crude produced at the Bonny Terminal stolen as at January 2022.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the NNPC GMD told participants at the NUPENG conference had observed that the impact of pipeline vandalism has reduced the capacity of the country to meet its production quota.\n\nHe lamented that currently, Nigeria is producing less than 1.5 million barrels per day of crude oil.\n\nKyari said as major stakeholders in the oil and gas business, that it was high time NUPENG and NARTO collaborate with the NNPC to bring the issue of crude oil theft to an end.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou can see the short trouble that we have and what it has caused all of us. But more than this comrades, our local industry is terribly challenged and you may be aware, we have seen vandals activities around our areas of operations not just in the Niger Delta but across other corridors of product supply.\n\n\u201cActivities of oil thieves that has gotten to a limit that we haven\u2019t seen before almost bringing this industry to its knees today.\n\n\u201cAs we speak now, our total production is less than 1.5 million barrels per day. This no doubt this will affect the investing companies, as many of them may not have the resources to continue to invest and therefore making more sustainable employment creation a challenge.\n\n\u201cThat is why all of us must practically come together to see how we can contain it. There is so much going on now. We are leading a process to ensure that we intervene in the security matter.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that everybody is involved so that ultimately we are able to get back this industry to avoid a total collapse, otherwise, we will not be talking about employment and this is the reality we are facing today.\n\n\u201cYou are very critical in stopping some of the situations today because when people steal products and they convert them to diesel, they will use your trucks to bring them into the country.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Presidential Options: The Die is Cast",
          "text": "\u2022Who amongst these aspirants will be chosen by Nigeria\u2019s changing electorate?\n\nA THISDAY Report\n\nA few weeks from now, two of these men \u2013 one each from the two main political parties \u2013 would emerge presidential candidates of their respective parties and dominate the political space in the countdown to the 2023 presidential run.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria boasts some 18 political parties, out of which less than five are truly active. But the season is here again and it\u2019s expected that a majority, if not all, would start to activate their machines in readiness for the 2023 general election.\n\nWhile many of the parties might field candidates for different elective offices, the possibility that a majority others would either form alliance or endorse the presidential candidates of either of the two major parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 is equally high.\n\nTherefore, about some eight weeks from now, all the serious parties would start to hold their presidential primaries and be ready with their candidates in the countdown to the big event \u2013 the presidential bout \u2013 in February 2023.\n\nAhead of the presidential primaries, however, some presidential hopefuls have started to openly indicate their interests in the nation\u2019s number one job, while a few others, who were deemed to be interested but have yet to say so, have equally hinted at the possibility, one way or the other.\n\nBut, their presidential aspiration aside, the fact of the moment is that the nation is in dire straits and there has never been a more urgent need to rescue Nigeria than it is now. Perhaps, the situation in Nigeria pre-2015 was nothing compared to the current situation, even though it necessitated the \u201cchange mantra\u201d that brought in the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nChallenged on all fronts \u2013 the same grounds the ruling APC travelled to power \u2013 the country has been hopping from increasing insecurity to a tottering economy and burgeoning corruption. Although the work of a president may not be physically demanding as does a bricklayer, it requires a degree of physical fitness and high mental alertness, to be able to address what is currently on the card in Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, the search for a messiah is back on stream and this time, the same opportunity, which presented itself in 2015, is showing up again except the Nigerian people choose to miss out on it, this time. There is a fierce urgency for a new leadership to steer the country away from the abyss to and redirect the ship of stay in a new direction. It starts with a carefully made presidential choice in 2023. This has become inevitable.\n\nThus, while zoning as a factor cannot be discarded arrogantly under whatever account or pretext, since it has become a critical glue holding the nation\u2019s many tendencies together, the quality of the candidate needed to do the job, has become more compelling if the current search for a president for all Nigerians is altruistic.\n\nAgainst this backdrop are a few of those, who have so far indicated interest in the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 \u2013 some of them are familiar names \u2013 and hopefully, the Nigerian people can find from amongst them, that individual, who understands the issues and knows what the problems are, and has a good and clear idea what solutions fit.\n\nAnyim Pius Anyim (PDP, South East)\n\nA former President of the Senate and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, has had those two huge platforms to showcase himself. An indigene of Ebonyi State, Anyim is one presidential hopeful, who has stayed away from scandals and maintained a lowkey profile. Although since leaving public office, he was completely tucked into his private life until activities ushering in 2023 picked up, he has also explained at every given opportunity that he understands Nigeria and can fix the problems.\n\nStrengths: He has experience and probably still keeps some good contacts after leaving office. He is from the South East, a zone that has consistently alleged marginalisation.\n\nWeaknesses: He seems a bit laidback for the task at hand and lacks colour. His acceptability within his South East is also a subject of debate, and that could challenge his national presence.\n\nAminu Tambuwal (PDP, North West)\n\nThe current two-term Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, was speaker of the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. He used his era as speaker to challenge some of the unfavourable policies of the former president Goodluck Jonathan administration, and that made him very popular. Although his governorship has not been anything spectacular, he has continued to leverage more, his days as speaker.\n\nStrengths: Naturally, coming from the core north often confers some advantage, and this is in addition to the fact that he is young and vibrant. He also wields some influence amongst his colleagues, being the chairman of PDP governors\u2019 forum.\n\nWeaknesses: Tambuwal has never been in the cluster of those considered as having the experience and maturity to face the nation\u2019s challenges. Being speaker and governor are not enough, he has yet to acquit himself as a potential presidential material. They are not the same.\n\nAtiku Abubakar (PDP, North East)\n\nA foremost presidential material, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, has always been in the forefront of the charge to lead the country. Indeed, in 2015, many held the view that he was the most prepared with clear ideas what he needed to do and where. The Turaki Adamawa is a household name and has all it takes to change the current narrative.\n\nStrengths: He has the experience, capacity and competence to address Nigeria\u2019s problems. He also knows Nigeria well enough and can balance the fault lines without crossing the lines.\n\nWeaknesses: Atiku has always had this never disappearing corruption tag, which mere explanations have refused to clear off. There are also questions about his age and health. Above all, he is categorised as part of the old order that brought Nigeria to its knees.\n\nBala Muhammed (PDP, North East)\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed is a first term governor and former Minister of the FCT. Although still in office, there\u2019s a general belief he has not used his opportunities to stand out at these other levels. Age is still on his side and he\u2019s promising. A product of some highwire local politics, which witnessed the alignment of the opposition in the state, Mohammed has yet to find his feet well, even as governor.\n\nStrengths: He is from a part of the north, which thinks it has been marginalised enough and therefore, deserves a shot at the presidency. He also has age on his side and from a party, which might throw its presidential ticket open for all.\n\nWeaknesses: He does not command the kind of national presence required of a man aspiring to the highest office in the land. A man still grappling with the needs of small Bauchi, cannot be handed the intimidating challenges of Nigeria. Nigeria at this time cannot try anyone, who might want to learn on the job. Besides, there\u2019s the speculation that he would rather return as governor than gamble with uncertainty.\n\nBukola Saraki (PDP, North Central)\n\nTwo-terms former governor of Kwara State, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, was President of the Senate between 2015 and 2019, a platform which availed him an opportunity to sell himself. Unlike many before him, Saraki made the office of the senate president very attractive and also drew attention to the fact that there was so much power and influence in being the nation\u2019s number three citizen. His days as senate president also showed him off as a dogged fighter, who despite the various traps set in his way, triumphed, defeating the corruption label that his opponents had tried to hang on his neck.\n\nStrengths: He has shown capacity, competence and has experience also going for him. He clearly understands the issues and at every turn, has always intervened in the Nigerian project, proffering solutions to those knotty national concerns, even as a floor senate member. He connects more with the youth and very much in tune with global trends. His zone, the north central, has been in the trenches for recognition, having been marginalised for many years. They consider now as their time.\n\nWeaknesses: His state of origin, which is now being seen as a form of strength, politically, is the first factor to count against him. Small Kwara in north central has always been hard to place, either as a northern or southern state, realistically. Besides, coming out at a time the clamour for southern presidency is on high note, is a tough call.\n\nBola Tinubu(APC, South West)\n\nA political juggernaut by every definition, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is by all standards, one of the biggest names in the nation\u2019s political lexicon today. From a relatively unknown Bola in 1999 to becoming the national leader of the ruling APC, today, Tinubu is a force to reckon with. Not only has he built an empire, he has made people and raised soldiers across all ages, walks of life and political leanings. Heavily connected and boasting huge war chest that could unsettle any cause, Tinubu is a political samurai, underestimated only at the peril of his opponents. In addition to commanding experience and competence, Tinubu has an enviable foresight for reading the political barometer, near accurately every season. In South West and beyond, he is an idol to many would-be politicians. He is a kingmaker, who now desires to be king.\n\nStrengths: Highly connected. Has experience and capacity. He seems prepared for what he called his life-long ambition to be president of Nigeria. He has the money required to prosecute his election. He has national presence. Understands some of the issues. Has a fatherly demeanor and the patience for the job. If not stopped by the Villa, he could claim the presidency without a fight.\n\nWeaknesses: Tinubu is largely considered corrupt and it\u2019s almost a consensus. He is one man, who is deemed rich, yet, has no known businesses to his name. Even the businesses marked against his name are easily denied, because they are believed to be held in trust. He is also old, sickly and weak. Age and health have taken their tolls and may be unable to stand the demands of the office. His mental alertness has been called to question many times. Also the Buhari albatross hangs on his neck. He and a clique within the APC brought Buhari. It is now almost like a cardinal sin that he brought Buhari. Can Nigeria afford the Alphabetarisation of Nigeria? He has a 60 million dollars private aircraft with no clear means of income; no factory employing people. Where did the money come? He has not been able to explain to the country he is striving to govern. Explaining his source of wealth becomes a big challenge on his road to becoming President of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nDavid Umahi(APC, South East)\n\nOutgoing Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, is about the only Southeast governor in the APC, who is desirous of succeeding President Buhari. Umahi, whose seat was recently threatened by the judgment of a Federal High Court, which sacked him before it was reversed at the appellate court, is believed to have done relatively well, when compared to some of his colleagues. An engineer by calling, he is one of those, who had openly indicated interest in the job, following after Tinubu.\n\nStrengths: Coming from the South East, the zone has continued to justify why it should be allowed to produce the president in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice. Records have also shown that he is a man of ideas and can champion developments. And, in terms of age, he would pass.\n\nWeaknesses: A recluse by simple definition, Umahi does not really have friends. Apart from compelling meeting of governors, his media exposure says as much. That also presupposes some tribalistic tendencies and definitely not what is needed at a time like this. His contacts are limited and therefore, boasts poor reach.\n\nDele Momodu (PDP, South South)\n\nOne of the most influential celebrity journalists in Nigeria\u2019s modern history, Bashorun Dele Momodu, is having his second outing in the nation\u2019s presidential run. His first outing, which didn\u2019t turn out good, was enough to have discouraged anyone from wanting to serve again, but Momodu\u2019s love for country would not let him look away. Publisher of the prestigious Ovation Magazine, which is sold across the world, has such contacts that only a few politicians can lay claims to. Sound, brilliant, capable and armed with requisite experience, the second coming of this Edo-born journalist and politician, is a welcome development in the scheme of things.\n\nStrengths: Young, experienced, capable and competent, Momodu is a quintessential global citizen, with friends and contacts across the world. His presidency can easily access his contacts in nation\u2019s interest and devote such to development purposes.\n\nWeaknesses: He does not have the kind of money needed to prosecute this kind of election. Politicians, and particularly, owners of Nigeria may not be willing to trust him with power.\n\nUdom Emmanuel (PDP, South South)\n\nThe current and outgoing governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, is one of the prides of PDP, given his development initiatives in the state, even though taking off was easy, because of the kind of legacy left behind by his predecessor, and Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who was famous for uncommon transformation. Udom has spent the last eight years, etching his footprints in the sand of time, a legacy of achievements, which has stoked him into wanting to serve at a higher pedestal.\n\nStrengths: He has shown capacity, experience, and maturity in tending to state matters. His ability to manage his predecessor and former benefactor as a major tendency is a plus that cannot be glossed over. Coming from the south is also an additional strength to his rating as a presidential hopeful.\n\nWeaknesses: Managing a relatively small Akwa Ibom is not a template that is applicable to managing Nigeria, because national politics differs significantly from regional ludo games. Besides, he is in a zone and party, where he can easily be muscled in terms of political advantage by the other big guns. He has to up his game, regardless.\n\nGodwin Emefiele (South South)\n\nAlthough the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, is from Delta, a South-south state; he is by providence, standing astride in both the South-south and the South East, thus, making his candidacy appealing to two critical zones that feel entitled to the presidency. The nation\u2019s economy has no doubt, been challenged in different ways, a sector in which Emefiele plays a significant role as the CBN governor; that the nation has not been overwhelmed, however, speaks to his efforts at mitigating those challenges. It was not by accident that the nation snapped out of recession twice to the shock of experts. It was also not sheer happenstance that Covid-19 did not shut down the economy. Some people stood in and plugged it. Kudos to the roles played by Emefiele in these and many respects. No doubt, these also accounted for the growing clamour that he should join the race. While he has yet to declare, Emefiele\u2019s supporters are damn certain he is the right man for the job.\n\nStrengths: A technocrat, whose time may have come, leading Nigeria with experience, and with insecurity linked to economy, he is believed to have the understanding of Nigeria\u2019s economy and issues challenging the country to be able to steer the affairs of state if gets the keys to the Villa. Another major factor going for him, is that he is trusted by the northern establishment who see him as someone they can work with.\n\nWeaknesses: First, he has the political class to contend with given his background. Politicians may not be too comfortable with him. He is from a minority South-south, a state controlled by the opposition. Emefiele lacks political base to command strong loyalty. Being a technocrat is also a weakness for him, as he is not seen by politicians as one of them, even if former President Olusegun Obasanjo was able to weather those storm in 1999\n\nIbikunle Amosun (APC, South West)\n\nFormer governor of Ogun State for eight years and senator representing Ogun central for a second term, Ibikunle Amosun, is one of the few contenders, who is very hands-on, firm and assertive. Progressive with development ideas, Amosun changed the face of Ogun in eight years so much that it might take decades to surpass his records. A grassroots politicians with intimidating machine in the politics of his state, his 2019 experience has not displaced him from the current equation in his state as the number one politician. A very good friend of the president, Amosun boasts the kind of contacts that are hard to link to him, except for close allies. He\u2019s got capacity, competence, experience, ideas and very futuristic.\n\nStrengths: His ideas are always taking into account, the foreseeable future. He is quietly friends with both the north and the south. Unknown to many, he is also friends with so many foreign presidents and never will flaunt them. He is very comfortable and has the wherewithal to prosecute his election, particularly, by pulling his friends up onto the field.\n\nWeaknesses: He is seen as very stubborn, although often times on principle. He has the penchant for disregarding processes and protocols if it would stand in the way of an idea he thought was meant to benefit the people. One of his major support pillars is Buhari and if his 2019 experience was to be factored into consideration, he can as well cancel out Buhari from his support base.\n\nKayode Fayemi (APC, South West)\n\nChairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has always distinguished himself in many respects. As a quintessential Omoluabi of the Yoruba extraction, he has used his office to prove that there is nothing esoteric about leadership. And, as a politician, who has learnt from his ugly experience, his politics has also been so elevated that, whoever underrates Fayemi now, might be doing so at very costly expense. Think all the boxes: capacity, competence, experience, networking, international contacts, ideas, development, focus, and blending across generations \u2013 Fayemi ticks them all. What\u2019s more? A ready-made presidential material.\n\nStrengths: He has learnt national politics so well and upgraded his local politics even more. How he has managed the governors from other parties is a case study. He knows the issues and would put them on the global stage almost effortlessly.\n\nWeaknesses: Coming from a rather small Ekiti, the kind of alignment required to build alliances could be frustrated by other states in the zone in an effort to undo him from clinching the ticket. He does not have the war-chest for the project, although could raise it through friends. Also, surviving the few months to the general election after leaving office is a major counter to his aspiration, as some of the things that currently count in his favour could be lost to being out of office.\n\nMohammed Hayatu-Deen(PDP, North East)\n\nA former Managing Director of the now defunct FSB International Bank, Mr. Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, recently joined the presidential race for 2023, after declaring for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). An economist, banker and former Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Hayatu-Deen started his career working in principal investments and project finance at the Northern Nigeria Development Corporation, later rechristened New Nigeria Development Corporation (NNDC), which at the time was Nigeria\u2019s largest industrial holding company with investments across a range of industries.He rose from there to the position of Group Chief Executive and was responsible for providing leadership, direction, and oversight to 140 subsidiary and associate companies under the group portfolio. His career therefrom blossomed significantly.\n\nStrengths: With a sound background in economics, coupled with a successful career in the banking sector, his experience would certainly come handy in remedying some of the nation\u2019s current economic challenges. He also boasts some maturity that could help on the job, aside coming from Borno, North East, thus enjoying both party and zone advantage.\n\nWeaknesses: Given an exposure largely rooted in the private sector, it comes with its challenges. Contending with political forces, who see such persons as coming to steal what\u2019s theirs is almost certain. His background has also limited his connection in a sense.\n\nNyesom Wike (PDP, South South)\n\nThe controversial Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has many limitations, especially with respect to his attitudinal disposition, but certainly not in terms of performance. It is almost a consensus that he has worked hard to take Rivers to a different level in terms of infrastructure development. He also understands politics very well, even though his style is crude. He has equally managed to extend his hold beyond the Rivers hemisphere. It is also not for jokes that many call him Mr. Projects.\n\nStrengths: Being governor of an oil rich Rivers is in itself a lot of advantage. It was a Rivers governor in the person of Rotimi Amaechi, who made Buhari\u2019s presidency possible in 2015. Wike has a lot of money and through his money, he has been able to buy loyalties and friends. This also accounts for why his reach transcends Rivers. He also has signature projects, which means he is not just presumed to be rascally; he is also development-focused.\n\nWeaknesses: Wike, without a doubt, lacks the character befitting of the office of the president. In every of his engagements, he throws decorum to the wind and treats his colleagues as if they are subservient. Unmindful of his integrity (if any), Wike is too reckless about his carriage. While he could actually undo many things, because of his money, he hardly can find the requisite support for his aspiration amongst his peers.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu (APC, South East)\n\nThe Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, started his political career with an eye on a senate seat in the old Imo State on the platform of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). He also contested for the position of Governor of Abia State in 1991, as candidate of the National Republican Convention and won. He was sworn in as the first Executive Governor of the State in January 1992, and was the first chairman, Conference of Nigerian elected Governors. In 1999, he was the presidential standard bearer of the All People\u2019s Party (APP), but relinquished the position to Olu Falae after a merger of his party with the Alliance for Democracy (AD), who lost to Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP. Ogbonnaya went on to become the National Chairman of the APP in 2010. In 2013, his party successfully merged with the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some members of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to form the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nStrengths: He has come a long way with a lot of experience, maturity, and networking. He is also from the South East, a zone that has been marginalised over time in the scheme of things. He a good ambassador of the Igbo.\n\nWeaknesses: Many believe he is not hands-on and his ideas are not in tune with modern day realities. He might be too laidback for the task ahead. His ideas are believed not to be sound.\n\nPeter Obi(PDP, South East)\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State and businessman, Peter Obi, has such ideas about how a state should run and those ideas always resonate with the ordinary people. A vice-presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 election, he has moved closer to the presidency than many from the his zone. Although he is wrestling with the zoning ideas like others, he has shown capacity, experience and huge understanding of the issues that are wrong with the nation state.\n\nStrengths: He knows the issues and almost has the solutions off-the-top of his head. He has built friends both in the private and public sectors and is very rich too, even though he embraces a spartan lifestyle.\n\nWeaknesses: With no home-zone support, it\u2019s a tall order to ride roughshod over others to clinch the ticket, much less the presidency. Some of his friends also think he is a pretender and often dismissed him as not bankable.\n\nRotimi Amaechi (APC, South South)\n\nThe Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, is often described as the \u201cstar boy\u201d of the administration, given the revolution going on in the rail sector of the economy as well as the maritime sector. A former governor of Rivers State, Amaechi has a record of performance and discharging every assignment well. It is no wonder that he is constantly stealing the show in this administration through his development initiatives. Although his efforts are being undermined lately by the activities of terrorists, none of those has stifled him from that which he thought would benefit a majority of the people. Thus, exhibiting capacity, experience and competence, he has held the transport ministry for almost eight years and to the awe of his principal and the people in general. From being speaker for eight years, governor for eight years and now minister for almost eight years, there is no question about his experience in governance and development.\n\nStrengths: He has capacity, competence and the exposure to do the job. He is also very hands-on and very much development-focused. He is a good politician, understands the issues, and can network easily. He has friends across all ages, sectors and affiliations and has money to do the election the same way he did Buhari\u2019s. He is also nice, kind and compassionate. Like Emefiele, his candidacy too stands on both the Southeast and the South-south.\n\nWeaknesses: He is stubborn and can be abrasive sometimes. He takes loyalty seriously and when there\u2019s a tinge of alleged mistrust, he could go off, sometimes without double-checking. There is the home-zone disadvantage too, although he seems to be making up for that with his ministerial posting.\n\nTimipre Sylva (APC, South South)\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, is another South-south presidential hopeful, but from Bayelsa State. A former governor, Sylva has relative executive experience to want to try the presidency of Nigeria. He also has a platform to build a network of friends, locally and internationally, using patronage effectively.\n\nStrengths: He is minister of petroleum and may find it easy to muster the war chest for his campaign. Experience too comes to play for him and capacity is arguable. Also, being from the South is an advantage.\n\nWeaknesses: He is largely drawn away from his colleagues and his network of friends can actually be thrown up for a debate. The petroleum ministry has not been doing well lately and the fact that they are still approbating and reprobating over subsidy removal questions his capacity by extension, even though he is not the principal minister. He too has the home-zone disadvantage.\n\nYahaya Bello(APC, North Central)\n\nThe Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, is another controversial governor, albeit in the ruling party. Almost eight years in office, Bello is grappling with some of the mundane issues of governance. Failing to apply discretion in some of his choices appears to be the hallmark of his leadership. Not many would forget in a hurry how he almost made a mess of the fight against Covid-19, at a time the world came together to battle the scourge. With unpaid salaries and pensions in the region of billions, which have not been given sufficient attention like his ambition, it\u2019s not difficult to ponder a good mental picture of what his presidency might look like.\n\nStrengths: He is young, energetic and has the capacity to throw money around at the expense of real governance issues.\n\nWeaknesses: Coming from the north attracts a resounding no in APC, after Buhari, another northerner\u2019s eight years. He delights to relish in issues that are lacking in substance. Governance has suffered under his watch and his colleagues just let him spawl further in his folly by strategically avoiding him. Save for those interested in his money, mustering a decent crowd for his ambition is almost impossible.\n\nYemi Osinbajo (APC, South West)\n\nHe is the current vice president of the country and a man that a lot of people, would have gladly agreed should step in after Buhari, since he would have worked with him for eight years. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has come of age in politics in just eight years. Indeed, he\u2019s practically graduated from the school of strategic politics. He now knows the game as much as its older actors. Barring any last minute changes, he is billed to declare his interest in the presidency any moment from now. One of his foot soldiers, Kayode Ajulo, hinted at this yesterday, when he shared a post, which read: \u201cOn your marks, oh my comrades, what we await and strive for is here. Oh, my comrades, hear the sound; so loud over landscape. Reprieve now appearing; victory is nigh. #PYOIsComing. #FileFunYemi. #RamadanKareem. #PYO23 #ProgressiveLawyers4PYO.\u201d\n\nFrom the many assignments he has been detailed, he has done well. So far, he has conducted himself so well, and even though he has not said a word, he has communicated his intention to run a long time ago. He has confidence, capacity, exposure and competence. Above all, he carries himself so presidentially and with cerebral demeanor, that he unsettles his traducers.\n\nStrengths: He is from the Southwest and as the current vice-president, he has leveraged a very good use of his office to the disadvantage of other aspirants. He has built a network of friends, contacts and connection across the world. He has shown to understand the issues and always propounds the solutions at any given opportunity.\n\nWeaknesses: First, running against Asiwaju is waiting to count majorly against him in the politics of the zone, even though such sentiment belies logic. But the narrative of a betrayal has been established successfully. Two, most of the friends and contacts he has built are \u2018office friends\u2019 and might fizzle out once they perceive that things might not go his way. Osinbajo may have to answer to questions about alleged bigotry as many people have continued to accuse him of giving preference to members of his church, the RCCG, at every turn and populating his office with them. Some politicians accuse him of not being honest and habitually double-faced.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan (PDP, South-South)\n\nDr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is a former president, who lost his bid for re-election and handed over to the incumbent in 2015. His political career began in 1998, when he was chosen by the late Diepreye Alaimeyeseigha as his running mate. The Alaimeyeseigha/Jonathan ticket won the election and he became the first civilian deputy governor of Bayelsa State on May 29, 1999. In 2005, he was sworn in as governor after his then boss ran into trouble with the law. In 2007, he won the PDP gubernatorial primary in Bayelsa State and was in the midst of his campaign, when he was nominated as vice presidential candidate to the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019 Adua and as fate would have it, he became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s demise, following prolonged ill-health. In 2011, he was elected president.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan became President on the PDP platform in his first term. The question on the lips of many now is should he decide to run this time, under which platform will he be running? Will it be under the PDP that gave him his first taste of power or will he switch party to the APC as is being speculated? This remains unclear, although he is currently a member of PDP.\n\nStrengths: He is trusted by the present administration, because of the way he handed over power. He is a democrat and adherent of the rule of law. As president, he promoted pro-people policies, especially, programmes such as the Almajiri schools he built in the North. He is also respected among the African leaders, because of efforts he has made to restore peace on the continent since he left office.\n\nWeaknesses: He is perceived to be a weak leader, who was controlled by women, when he was in power, leading to his electoral loss in 2015. However, it is not clear if\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "JNI: Any Govt Incapable of Protecting Citizens Lacks Moral Justification to Be in Power",
          "text": "\u2022Says continuous mayhem, killings, callousness automatically resetting people\u2019s psyche to accept situation as normal\n\nJohn Shiklam\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Nigerians continue to lament the worsening spate of insecurity in the country, Jama\u2019atu Nasir Islam (JNI), the umbrella body for Northern Muslims, has declared that any government that is unable to safeguard the lives and property of its citizens has lost the moral justification to be in power.\n\nIn a statement yesterday in Kaduna, the religious body headed by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, condemned the persistent attacks and killings by terrorists in the country. It bemoaned the recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train in which eight people were confirmed killed while many others were either abducted or injured.\n\nThe statement signed by the Secretary General of JNI, Dr. Khalid Aliyu, declared, \u201cAny government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place; this is enunciated in Section 33(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt stressed regarding to train attack, \u201cThe well-orchestrated incident remains highly condemnable, reprehensible and upsetting to every rational mind.\u201d\n\nJNI stated that the frequent attacks and killings, which occurred almost on a daily basis, were becoming normal occurrences among Nigerians, noting that humanity is gradually being eroded and criminality accepted as the new normal.\n\nThe group said, \u201cIt appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities and/or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it.\n\n\u201cThe humanity in us is slowly being eroded thereby making us adapt to the new normal within which we unfortunately found ourselves.\u201d\n\nJNI maintained, \u201cIn Islam and by all global standards, the essence of government and governance is solely to protect the five principal cardinal rights of the human race, the most important of which is LIFE!\u201d\n\nAliyu said JNI had carefully studied and followed the train blast, especially, the attack on another train, reported to have occurred on the Lagos-Kano bound train, near Jaji, Kaduna state, on March 31, which led to the death of the locomotive operator.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this press release is premised on the fact that Nigeria is more or less heading to an unknown destination of multiple cum well-coordinated serial chaos attributable to lack of coordination and synergy from security personnel, if the news making the round is to be believed,\u201d he said.\n\nJNI said in Islam, human life was sacrosanct, \u201cThat is why Allah (SWT) declared in the Glorious Quran that if a single soul is killed without just cause, then it is as if the entire humanity is wiped off the face of the earth.\n\n\u201cWe claim to be people of faith and all these occurrences are allowed without any form of prompt intervention. Why?\n\n\u201cWell, it should be known that an attack on one soul; is an attack on all, and this is how the human race should be preserved and protected, but if allowed to continue we fear the consequence(s) of the innocent souls that were killed, without any fault of theirs.\u201d\n\nThe statement regretted that, \u201cTerrorists are now becoming bolder and more belligerent by the day. They operate in any area of their choice(s) at any time they so wish.\n\n\u201cThey even operate for up to eight hours non-stop (as it was reported to have happened in Niger state last Monday), without any fear of being confronted or apprehended.\u201d\n\nIt lamented that, \u201cMost communities are now under the bandits\u2019 absolute control with taxes being paid to bandits\u2013some parts of Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto states and some others yet to be disclosed to the public.\n\n\u201cIn fact, terrorists do what they wish knowing that there is no gun power or authority that will defy them.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic body wondered why the security situation had continued to deteriorate, despite the allocation of huge resources to the security agencies.\n\nJNI stated, \u201cWith all the reported resources allocated to relevant security agencies; intelligent gathering mechanism, military arsenal and tact, can\u2019t the government provide any convincing justification on why the security situation in the country continue to deteriorate?\n\n\u201cWhy are attacks experienced all over the place and continuing unabated without any deterrence?\n\n\u201cMoreover, why must security budget and expenditure remain so secretive, despite the reported release of funds?\n\n\u201cThe mind boggling train attack of Monday 28th March, 2022, the kidnap and sporadic shootings that ensued thereafter the train en-route Kaduna needs to be seriously investigated and punitive measures taken.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, commended the security personnel who exhibited capacity, resilience, determination and dexterity during rescue operations on the attacked Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\nJNI noted that most Nigerians were of the belief that the government knew the enclaves and hideouts of the criminals, especially considering the fact that only the government had monopoly of legal force, and, by extension, the machinery for intelligence gathering.\n\nThe statement queried, \u201cAgain, why can\u2019t the government proactively take the battle to the criminals\u2019 hideouts and wipe them off?\n\n\u201cWhy should the government wait until people are attacked, lives and properties lost for them to strike and be issuing empty orders and usual condemnation? The whys are endless?\u201d\n\nit then stated, \u201cOur pleas: it is high time the security outfits are directed to ransack the enclaves of all criminal elements and deal with them decisively.\n\n\u201cInformants should not be spared, as they are more dangerous than the killers. They should be made to face the right punishment befitting their crime.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community should beef-up their efforts in trying to dig to the root of this phenomena.\u201d\n\nIt noted that most acts of terrorism and banditry were carried out under the influence of hard drugs and called on the authorities to wage war on the use of illicit drugs.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cAs part of effort to tackle insecurity in Nigeria, the war on drug should be placed on the front burner as it is the elixir that spurs criminals to action.\n\n\u201cSuppliers, vendors and traffickers of hard drug and intoxicants must be dealt with decisively.\n\n\u201cThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency(NDLEA) and other security agencies should as a matter of national security note and penetrate into villages, higher institution campuses, motor parks and recreational or viewing centres, because they are now dwellings where hard drugs/substances are being peddled brazenly.\n\n\u201cLikewise, parents, religious and community leaders have a role to play in the fight against illicit drugs/substance pervading most households within our neighbourhoods.\n\n\u201cThis should be considered a fight for all and not only for the government.\u201d\n\nThe JNI appealed to those vested with the responsibility of protecting lives to do their job with the fear of God.\n\nIt warned against the politicisation of security, stating, \u201cIf the terrorists have the effrontery to attack at any time without fear, why should the government shy away from pursuing and destroying them?\n\n\u201cWe nevertheless reiterate our several calls to government that there is strong nexus between the Boko Haram insurgency and the on-going banditry in some parts of country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, barred all outgoing calls from every SIM card not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the telecom subscriber.\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who gave the order, also directed the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to direct all telecoms operators to begin the deactivation of all unlinked SIM cards with immediate effect, insisting that all telecoms subscribers must comply with the NIN-SIM linkage policy of the federal government.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, jointly signed by Director, Public Affairs, at NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, and Head, Corporate Communications, at National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Mr. Kayode Adegoke, Pantami commended Nigerians and legal residents for their support during the exercise to link their NIN to their SIM cards.\n\nThe recent order to bar all unlinked SIM cards came 16 months after the federal government gave the first order to deactivate all SIM cards not registered and linked to NIN.\n\nPantami had in December 2020 directed the NCC to order telecoms operators to deactivate any SIM card not duly registered and linked to subscribers\u2019 NIN, after the initial December 31, 2020 deadline, given for NIN-SIM linkage.\n\nBased on the inability of subscribers to meet up with the December 31, 2020 deadline, the federal government had to postpone the deadline and had since postponed it 10 times to date.\n\nAt the last postponement, which was on December 31, 2021, Pantami conveyed the approval of the federal government to further extend the deadline for the NIN-SIM data verification and linkage from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022.\n\nAlthough NIMC had said NIN registration would continue in all its centres, the federal government, yesterday said it would commence barring of all unlinked SIM cards with immediate effect, and told subscribers yet to register and link their SIM cards to do so before they could make outgoing calls.\n\nThe federal government, however, commended Nigerians for the compliance level in registering and linking the SIMs to NINs, saying 125 million SIMs have been submitted for linkage to NINs.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAs of date, over 125 million SIMs have had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification and authentication. Similarly, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued over 78 million unique NINs till date.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari gave the directive for the implementation and commencement of the exercise in December 2020, as part of the administration\u2019s security and social policies. The deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage has been extended on multiple occasions to allow Nigerians to freely comply with the policy.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also took into consideration the passionate appeals by several bodies- Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Civil Societies, Professional Bodies and a host of others \u2013 for the extension of the deadlines in the past.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Mr. President graciously approved the many requests to extend deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage. At this point however, government has determined that the NIN-SIM Policy implementation can proceed, as machinery has already been put in place to ensure compliance by citizens and legal residents.\n\n\u201cThe implementation impacts on government\u2019s strategic planning, particularly in the areas of security and socio-economic projections.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the implementation of the policy with effect from the 4th of April, 2022. Consequently, the federal government has directed all Telcos to strictly enforce the Policy on all SIMs issued (existing and new) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOutgoing calls will subsequently be barred for telephone lines that have not complied with the NIN-SIM linkage policy from the 4th of April, 2022. Subscribers of such lines are hereby advised to link their SIMs to their NINs before the Telcos can lift the restriction on their lines. Affected individuals are hereby advised to register for their NINs at designated centers and thereafter link the NINs to their SIMs through the channels provided by NIMC and the Telcos, including the NIMC mobile App.\u201d\n\nPantami commended the Executive Vice-Chairman of NCC, Professor Umar Garba Dambatta, Director-General/Chief Executive Officer of NIMC, Aliyu Abubakar Aziz, along with their management and staff, as well as other notable bodies whose efforts had contributed to the monumental success of the exercise.\n\nPantami said enrolment for NIN would be a continuous exercise and that NIN would henceforth be a precondition for service in telcos, banks, Nigerian Immigration Service, and several other government services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\nThe federal government has barred all outgoing calls on every SIM card that is not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the SIM card owner.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who gave the order Monday to bar outgoing calls on every unliked Subscriber Identification Module (SIM card), also ordered the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecoms industry regulator, to direct all telecoms operators to begin deactivation of all unlinked SIM cards with immediate effect, insisting that all telecoms subscribers must comply with the NIN-SIM linkage Policy of the federal government.\n\nThe federal government however, commended Nigerians for the compliance level in registering and linking their SIM to their NIN, saying that 125 million SIMs have had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification and authentication, and that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued over 78 million unique NINs till date.\n\nIn a statement issued by the federal government and jointly signed by the Director, Public Affairs at NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde and the Head, Corporate Communications, at NIMC, Mr. Kayode Adegoke, Pantami commended Nigerians and legal residents for their support during the exercise to link the National Identification Number (NIN) to the Subscriber Identification Module (SIM).\n\n\u201cAs of date, over 125 Million SIMs have had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification and authentication. Similarly, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued over 78 million unique NINs till date,\u201d Pantami said.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the implementation of the Policy with effect from the 4th of April, 2022. Consequently, the Federal Government has directed all Telcos to strictly enforce the Policy on all SIMs issued (existing and new) in Nigeria. Outgoing calls will subsequently be barred for telephone lines that have not complied with the NIN-SIM linkage Policy from the 4th of April, 2022. Subscribers of such lines are hereby advised to link their SIMs to their NINs before the Telcos can lift the restriction on their lines. Affected individuals are hereby advised to register for their NINs at designated centers and thereafter link the NINs to their SIMs through the channels provided by NIMC and the Telcos, including the NIMC mobile App.\n\n\u201dPantami thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his tremendous support. He also commended the Executive Vice-Chairman of the NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Dambatta, the Director-General/Chief Executive Officer of NIMC, Aliyu Abubakar Aziz along with their management and staff, as well as other notable bodies whose efforts have seen to the monumental success of the exercise.\n\nThe Minister also extended his thanks to the telecommunication operators for their support towards the success recorded.Pantami said enrolment for NIN would be a continuous exercise and that NIN would henceforth be a precondition for service in Telcos, Banks, Nigerian Immigration Service, and for several other government services.He also encouraged Nigerians and legal residents to visit NIN registration centres for the enrollment and issuance of valid NINs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Appetito\u2019s \u201cdark stores\u201d are a test for multi-node last-mile distribution in Africa",
          "text": "In Alexandria, Egypt\u2019s famous port city, you can drop into any corner store to pick up eggs for an evening meal. Shoppers line up at Spinneys, one of Egypt\u2019s oldest grocery store chains, or any of the other popular hypermarkets to buy the week\u2019s groceries. And oud voices haggling over the price of exotic fish in Al Mansheya\u2019s alley markets is not uncommon.\n\nIt is the only way most people know to shop. Carrefour\u2019s\u2014a popular shopping mall in the City Centre\u2014still gets large crowds during peak hours, and the Souq Al Barsim near Alexandria Corniche is still a bustling open market any day. But more than a few Egyptian grocery shoppers are adopting a new buying behaviour\u2014tapping their smartphones to order everything they need to make the next meal, from cereals to fresh food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge market, and it\u2019s highly fragmented and multi-layered,\u201d Shehab Mokhtar tells TechCabal.\n\nMokhtar is the founder and CEO of Appetito, an on-demand grocery retail business that delivers groceries to users from a small network of dark stores in Cairo. The press statement announcing its $2M pre-Series raise says Appetito now delivers 2,000 items from 12 fulfilment centres every day.\n\nUnlike most popular on-demand startups in the grocery business, Appetito doesn\u2019t promise quick deliveries. Instead, Mokhtar says Appetito offers 60-minute or even weekly scheduled deliveries and an opportunity to save on prices. This \u201cquick-commerce\u201d startup is betting that slow is good business and Egyptians won\u2019t mind waiting for an hour for next week\u2019s groceries to reach their doorsteps. Like Getir, its Turkish peer in the quick-commerce business, the Egyptian on-demand grocery startup wants to be as close as possible to its Egyptian customers.\n\nHow? By creating a network of micro-fulfilment centres located minutes away from the homes of Appetito users.\n\nThe Getir framework for last-mile distribution.\n\nOnly the red-painted motorcycles that zip in and out of the quiet neighbourhood betray the true nature of the small building where a gloved picker emerges once every few minutes to hand a waiting rider branded packages. This is one of Appetito\u2019s dark stores in a Cairo suburb. By the end of this year, Mokhtar says Appetito will have expanded its dark store network to 3 cities\u2014Cairo, Giza, and Alexandria. The company plans to add 50 more dark stores every year until 2024.\n\n\u201cDark stores\u201d are shops that don\u2019t sell directly to customers. Instead, they are micro-fulfilment centres for orders that have come through digital platforms. Because customers don\u2019t have to enter the shops, dark stores have more space to store inventory and quickly and accurately fulfil orders.\n\nInside any of Appetito\u2019s 12 dark stores, pickers browse a list of items from an online order and move around the tiny aisles collecting the items and packing them. FMCG suppliers like Unilever, Henkel, Procter & Gamble, and Kellogg\u2019s deliver items in bulk to these mini-warehouses. In contrast, perishable food items are shipped directly or stored in better-equipped facilities.\n\nAppetito does not own these mini-warehouses. It operates a franchise system where local partners provide some of the capital and manage in-store operations. Appetito only helps with hiring and stocking the stores and its proprietary inventory management software.\n\nIn addition to sourcing its products directly from leading FMCG manufacturers, Appetito also sells its private label products and collects a fee for advertising suppliers\u2019 products on its app.\n\nMokhtar says his goal is to build Egypt\u2019s operation and technology infrastructure to connect brands with customers and provide \u201ca convenient and affordable experience\u201d with flexible payment options. If everything goes according to plan, the shoppers who do their grocery shopping in one of Alexandria\u2019s many street markets will have one more option for weekly restocking\u2014their smartphones.\n\nStephen Deng, Partner at DFS Lab says his venture capital firm are, \u201cbig believers that dark stores represent a shift in last-mile retail that\u2019s here to stay.\u201d\n\nBut dark stores are not chugging away unchallenged.\n\nIn Europe, for example, their pandemic-spurred growth has attracted the ire of city governments. Some of them have even called them a \u201cblight\u201d, which is ironic since the very restrictions these governments enforced enabled dark stores to thrive. But these regulatory setbacks offer startups like Appetito a glimpse of what to expect when 150 dark stores begin delivering store-keeping units (SKUs) numbering hundreds of thousands a day.\n\nBut regulatory hurdles are just one of many challenges they will face.\n\nThe last-mile question\n\nDigital commerce entrepreneurs often say they are solving \u201cfragmented\u201d buying and selling. That is partly true. When you shop for groceries through Appetito\u2019s app, you don\u2019t have to visit multiple stores yourself.\n\nBut there is a different perspective. One that looks at the story of digital commerce as an ongoing attempt to aggregate the act of buying while simultaneously separating the act of buying to an online frontend for ordering and paying for goods, inventory management software and the dozens of motorcycles zipping through traffic to deliver orders.\n\nIn other words, digital commerce, especially the quick-commerce variety, is fragmentation on motorcycles.\n\nAs pandemic restrictions fade, however, the question at the heart of dark-store powered quick-commerce is changing.\n\n\n\nWith home deliveries returning to being a convenience instead of a necessity and a brewing economic downturn, the emerging question is, what do customers want? Groceries and home cleaning supplies delivered in 15 minutes? Or groceries bought at the lowest prices?\n\nThe best aggregators will win as a population grappling with rising inflation post-COVID interventions tests on-demand grocery startups. One recurring request on Appetito\u2019s Facebook page is for discount codes for the day.\n\nIf we can draw on lessons from previous economic downturns in the region, how much \u201caggregation\u201d will save for the consumer will play a more vital role than how fast the order is delivered. Even Getir is opening its dark stores for nearby shoppers to pick up their orders. In Egypt, offline retail shops are just around the corner.\n\nMokhtar seems to understand this. He told TechCrunch in an earlier interview, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to mix between affordability and convenience. If we\u2019re going to go only for the convenience, which is 10 or 15 minutes, that\u2019s going to be at the expense of affordability,\u201d Mokhtar said. \u201cAnd this is something we do not seek or even try to scale in Egypt or the countries that we are trying to penetrate going forward.\u201d\n\nIf digital commerce is a bet that convenience generates orders, Uber-for-groceries startups will need to show how dark store franchises make the business maths work. Appetito is the leading case study candidate for this in Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "During a chat at the company\u2019s head office in Yaba, a suburb on Lagos Mainland once touted as Nigeria\u2019s Silicon Valley, CEO Tayo Oviosu recalls the epiphany moment that led to the founding of Paga back in April 2009.\n\nThe Stanford-educated Oviosu had just returned to the country he was born and raised in but left at age 16 and wanted to venture into the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nOpportunities in the private sector at the time were immense. Nigeria\u2019s central bank was pushing for a cashless economy but banks were slow to innovate. After considering several ideas for a couple of months, Oviosu came up with what is now Paga.\n\n\u201cBack then, a lot of transactions in Nigeria were largely cash-dependent which was inefficient for both businesses and individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cPaga was born out of my own frustration with carrying cash around. The idea was simple\u2014there had to be a way to make payments simpler.\u201d\n\nOviosu, aiming to build the \u201cPaypal for Africa\u201d, then teamed up with Jay Alabraba to launch a mobile payments company named Paga, a Spanish word that means \u201cto pay\u201d.\n\nPaga was arguably the first fintech company in Nigeria to popularise mobile money among the unbanked. At the time it was launched, the main players bridging payments with mobile technology in Nigeria were Interswitch, eTranzact, and SystemSpec\u2019s Remita.\n\nThirteen years on, Paga\u2014now a UK-headquartered Group\u2014has amassed more than 19 million unique users through its consumer channel and agent network of over 120,000 agents across Nigeria. Since the company began commercial operations in 2012, it\u2019s processed over $10 billion ( \u20a64 trillion).\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Oviosu reflects on Paga\u2019s evolution and growth and talks about product innovation, global expansion, and the next phase for both Paga and the fintech landscape in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDigitising consumer payments\n\nOviosu\u2019s goal for Paga was to build a platform that simplified payments, digitised cash transactions, and delivered financial services to the mass market. He started with a team of 8, a figure that\u2019s grown to more than 100.\n\nPaga\u2019s initial set of products was focused on providing more people access to traditional banking services \u2013 especially sending and receiving money \u2013 through mobile phones and physical agents equipped with POS devices. At an agent outlet, customers show up without an account number and for a fee, are able to send and receive money to anyone.\n\nIn December 2019, after the introduction of national identity numbers (NIN) and bank verification numbers (BVN), Paga launched its consumer direct product that allowed users to create mobile accounts and used wallets for transactions through the mobile app and USSD.\n\nAccording to Oviosu, more than 3.7 million wallets have been created on Paga since then while the company plans to roll out physical and virtual cards later this year.\n\nA chart showing growth in Paga\u2019s TPV since its founded. Image credit: Paga.\n\nOver the years, Paga\u2019s total processed value (TPV) has grown exponentially. While it took the company 99 months to get to its first \u20a62 trillion, Oviosu revealed it took 22 months to reach the next \u20a62 trillion.\n\nIn 2021, Paga crossed the \u20a61 trillion mark in annual TPV for the first time\u2014hitting \u20a61.2 trillion\u2014and is on track to reach \u20a62 trillion this year alone, according to the CEO.\n\nAs part of its consumer payments play, Paga in February announced its addition as a payment provider for Twitter Tips, a feature that enables Twitter users to either send or receive by simply linking their preferred third-party payment service providers to their profiles.\n\nBeyond consumer payments, however, Paga is now a fintech behemoth helping merchants digitise payments (under a separate brand called Doroki) and opening up its infrastructure for third-party companies to easily offer financial services.\n\nPaga Group is a teenager today! What started out as a simple idea to make it simple to pay & get paid is now 3 business lines:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Consumer Payments \u2013 @paga\n\n\u2013 Embedded Finance \u2013 Paga PaaS https://t.co/AvGdBzElZ5\n\n\u2013 Seller/Merchant \u2013 @doroki_ng\n\n\n\nThanks to our amazing team \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/yC5Gv64kGm \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) April 3, 2022\n\nDoroki for merchants\n\nLast year, Paga launched Doroki, a separate unit within the Group that leverages Paga\u2019s payment infrastructure to help SMEs digitise payments.\n\nDoroki allows merchants to accept cards and other forms of digital payments via point-of-sale (POS) terminals and mobile POS handheld devices, making it easy for them to get paid and track inventory while enabling them to provide other value-added financial services to customers.\n\nWhile Covid-19 has increased the use of technology in payments and money transfers in Africa, the purchase and onboarding cost of POS devices is unaffordable for most merchants.\n\nPaga announced last year a partnership with Untapped Global to provide financing that would lower the cost of entry for merchants, with payments recovered from the revenues earned on the devices.\n\nAfter a successful pilot programme, which saw 2,000 businesses provided with financed POS devices, Oviosu revealed that more than 6,000 sellers currently now use Doroki to collect payments in the wake of the commercial launch last November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build an ecosystem for the consumer to conveniently make payments and for SMEs to manage their businesses and do payrolls,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nProduct infrastructure play\n\nFrom merely enabling Nigerians (individuals and businesses) to make and receive payments with ease, the Paga group now offers open-source APIs to companies for building products.\n\nPaga\u2019s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business started with the acquisition of a remittance license in 2018, after which it allowed companies like Western Union and Wise to terminate remittances to accounts in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, Paga opened up its platform to more businesses through Collect APIs, which more than 200 businesses currently use.\n\nPaga\u2019s open wallet is available to any third-party developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compete with you building your wealth management app; we\u2019ll help you,\u201d the CEO said, adding that its recent integration with Flutterwave is built around the same APIs.\n\nThis wknd I experienced the power of Paga's Connect API \u2013 one-click payments \u2013 on @theflutterwave as I paid for my day 2 return covid test \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nI had previously linked my Paga acct to Flutterwave so going fwd it's super easy to pay on any website using Flutterwave!@TechProd_Arch pic.twitter.com/6WJkFOvAWa \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) January 24, 2022\n\nIn effect, Paga has extended beyond the payments business to becoming a product infrastructure company, which entails entering into partnerships with tech companies in similar and adjacent sectors.\n\nPaga\u2019s Nigeria approach\n\nPaga\u2019s go-to-market strategy in Nigeria has been a hybrid approach that combines offline and online channels. \u201cA majority of the population may not be tech-savvy and smartphone penetration is still low,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nStarting out, Paga relied on a retail network of shops and agents that consumers can visit for in-person transactions. \u201cTo scale in Africa, you need a hybrid (digital and physical) approach. If you don\u2019t want or know how to use the technology, you can go to agents and still deal in [physical] cash, but the agent can do the digital.\u201d\n\nOviosu acknowledges that in Nigeria, physical cash is very much still a thing and won\u2019t go away anytime soon. Smartphone penetration has also not improved significantly. Hence, the company \u201cstill needs on ramps & off ramps to cash\u201d.\n\nAlthough the share of Paga\u2019s total transactions being done via agents has declined in recent years.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, agents accounted for about 90% of our transactions. Last year, that figure fell to 60%, an indication that other channels/parts of the business are growing fast.\u201d\n\nA Paga paypoint in Lagos. Image credit: Tayo Oviosu/Twitter.\n\nWhat next for Paga? Expansion\n\n\u201cThe vision is still the same\u2014to solve payments for individuals and businesses,\u201d Oviosu said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken an open approach. It\u2019s not a closed circle.\u201d\n\nOn what an \u201copen approach\u201d means, the CEO explained that with Paga, users can link their several bank accounts, debit cards, and mobile money wallets from other providers.\n\nIn addition, anybody\u2014including non-Paga account holders\u2014can pay a Doroki merchant. \u201cYou can walk into a store and pay with your card, scan a QR code, or make payments using USSD from any bank.\u201d\n\nWhile the vision has been steady, the ambition and scope of Paga have grown over time.\n\nAlongside product expansion, Paga has in its sight a global expansion starting with Ethiopia. In January 2020, it acquired Apposit, an Ethiopian software development company that is planned to be its vehicle for entry into East Africa and Latin America. Last month, Paga announced an official launch in the Horn of Africa country.\n\nBecause there are local nuances to be aware of, Paga has a local team of at least 50 in Ethiopia. The payments platform was also built to be multilingual, so switching from one language to another is easy.\n\nAs per funding the expansion plans, Oviosu revealed Paga, which has secured $35 million to date\u2014with the backing of investors such as Jim O\u2019Neill and Tim Draper\u2014is looking to raise additional capital.\n\nTayo Oviosu, Paga co-founder and CEO.\n\nFintech innovation in Africa\n\nOn the next phase of innovation in Africa\u2019s fintech space, Oviosu expects new startups to build more solutions on existing infrastructure provided by older players like Paga, Flutterwave, Paystack, etc. to solve key problems.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years of Paga was building infrastructure where it didn\u2019t exist. We built a hybrid payment infrastructure for the online and offline customer,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cNew companies don\u2019t need to repeat that. I expect to see more of them focusing on niche markets that can scale, leveraging existing platforms through open-source APIs.\u201d\n\nAs for Paga, the vision remains the same: getting up to one billion people using its platform to access and use money, according to Oviosu.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "The Nigerian climate change act \u2013 key highlights",
          "text": "Introduction\n\nPresident Muhammed Buhari would be credited for taking a giant stride at the start of this decade on climate action both in Nigeria and globally by signing the Climate Change Act (CCA or the Act) into law on November 18, 2021. The enactment of the Act as the primary statutory framework for Nigeria\u2019s energy transition drive is a firm indication of the country\u2019s policy on the issue of climate change.\n\nSequel to the execution of international treaties like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, climate change and the reduction of carbon emissions has been acknowledged as an issue of global concern.\n\nParticipating with other parties to the UNFCC in the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, Nigeria, reiterated its commitment to achieving a net-zero global emission target by 2060.\n\nWith the passage of the Act, Nigeria joins a host of countries, including France and Sweden, in enacting local legislation targeting the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and tackling climate change\n\nWith the passage of the Act, Nigeria joins a host of countries, including France and Sweden, in enacting local legislation targeting the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and tackling climate change. Against this backdrop, this piece examines the critical highlights of the CCA and considers its possible impact in Nigeria.\n\nObjectives and scope\n\nThe Act provides a legal and institutional framework for reducing GHG emissions to the atmosphere by ensuring the formulation of programmes and policies for such purposes. It keys into Nigeria\u2019s international climate change obligations by setting a target for the years 2050-2070 to attain a net-zero GHG emission.\n\nThe provision of the Act broadly applies to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government, and public and private entities within Nigeria. It mandates them to develop and implement mechanisms engendered towards fostering an environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient society.\n\nNational Council on Climate Change and the secretariat\n\nThe CCA establishes the National Council on Climate Change (the Council), a statutory body with perpetual succession vested with the powers to make policies and decisions on climate change in Nigeria. As part of the plethora of the Council\u2019s climate change responsibilities, it shall drive the implementation of various sectoral targets and guidelines for the ultimate reduction of GHG emissions and other causes of climate change. It shall also have the obligation to approve and oversee the National Climate Change Action Plan (Action Plan) and administer the Climate Change Fund.\n\nThe President of Nigeria heads the Council as the Chairman and the Vice President as Vice Chairman. Other members shall include Ministers responsible for Environment, Petroleum Resources, representatives of women, youth, and persons with disability.\n\nEstablishment of climate change fund\n\nThe Act establishes a Climate Change Fund (the Fund) to be maintained by the Council, comprising of various funding sources, including sums appropriated by the National Assembly for the administration of the Council, grants, donations, fees for the services rendered by the Council and funding from International Organisations.\n\nThe Fund shall be applied towards various objectives like meeting the administrative cost of running the Council and all its offices, supporting climate change advocacy, and incentivising entities to transition to clean energy and sustain a reduced GHG emission.\n\nCarbon Budget and Climate Change Action Plan\n\nThe Act mandates the Federal Ministries for Environment and National Planning to develop a carbon budget to keep the average rise in global temperature within 2\u00b0C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In conjunction with the above Ministries, the Council, through its secretariat, will also be tasked in every five-year cycle to develop a National Climate Change Action Plan, the first of which is expected at a date not later than 12 months from the commencement of the Act.\n\nRead also: Forward thinking; How sustainability will shape Africa\u2019s business climate\n\nHowever, such Action Plan must first be made available to the public for consultation and presented to the Federal Executive Council for approval.\n\nClimate change obligations\n\nThe Act imposes climate change obligations on Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), private and public entities. These obligations are considered below:\n\nMDAs\n\nMDAs are required to establish a climate change desk to ensure the integration of climate change obligations into their core mandate and foster adherence to the annual carbon emission reduction targets in line with the Action Plan and Carbon Budget. The failure of an MDA to meet the carbon emission reduction target shall be reviewed. If found liable, its principal officers shall be sanctioned and, where appropriate, fined as may be determined by the Council.\n\nPrivate entities\n\nA private entity is defined as a body with functions of a private nature, including bodies registered under the Companies and Allied Matters. Although the Act imposes obligations on private entities, it sets a threshold for its applicability to entities with a minimum of 50 employees.\n\nSuch entities are obligated to put measures in place to ensure the achievement of carbon emission targets in line with the Action Plan. In the same vein, they are also required to designate a Climate Change Officer or an Environmental Sustainability Officer to submit annual reports of the organization\u2019s efforts to meet carbon emission reduction targets to the Council\u2019s Secretariat.\n\nPublic entities\n\nThese organisations provide services to the public on behalf of the Nigerian government. Unlike private entities, the Act does not give in clear terms the scope of public entities\u2019 obligations. Instead, it acknowledges the Council\u2019s power to impose climate change obligations on such entities. Notably, however, the Act provides inclusion in the Action Plan proposed incentives for both private and public entities to achieve GHG emission reduction. In view of this, it can be gleaned that public entities are also urged to contribute to the decarbonisation efforts of the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we acknowledge that the Act further reflects Nigeria\u2019s commitment to addressing the issue of climate change as it provides the landscape to drive GHG emissions reduction. Its broad coverage and applicability are of particular comfort as it cuts across various sectors and corporate forms in its prescription of obligations.\n\nHowever, at this point, one can only hope that the provisions of the CCA and its lofty ideals are implemented as envisaged, particularly given Nigeria\u2019s economic reality, which is dependent on its oil and gas sector for foreign exchange earnings. Also, eliminating gas flaring will be critical for the attainment of gas emission targets and overall climate change objectives. It would therefore require an enormous amount of determination and will for the Act\u2019s objectives to not only be implemented but fully realised.\n\nAkaluzia is an Associate in the Enterprise and Corporate Governance Practice at Olaniwun Ajayi LP",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nStakeholders in the Niger Delta Region in Nigeria have expressed optimism that with continuous engagement with critical government agencies the region will be able to overcome the inherent challenges that have deviled the area and the country at large in the past due to corruption.\n\nIt is no more a secret that one of the issues that is on the front burner at every discourse when the dwindling fortune of Nigeria, especially the oil rich region is being articulated is corruption amongst the government agencies and politicians in the corridor of power.\n\nAt the center of this colossal waste of the nation\u2019s wealth is the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, and the six oil producing states of Edo, Abia, Delta, Imo, Rivers and Ondo state and the National Assembly where the elected members take care of their own interest more than their constituents\n\nTo address reforms and issues of transparency and accountability in NDDC and the oil producing states as well as promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms the Africa Network for Environment Justice, ANEEJ held the Enhancing Anti-corruption and social inclusive reform initiatives in Nigeria project inception meeting at Abuja recently with stakeholders in attendance\n\nIn the words of the facilitator, Rev David Ugolor, Executive Director of ANEEJ, this important project seeks to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms at both the national and sub-national levels as well as designed to enhance local civil society organizations ability to be positive and responsible change agents in Nigeria\n\nHe said, \u201cEnhancing Anti-Corruption and Social inclusive Reforms initiatives in Nigeria is designed following the anchor cluster model adopted by Palladium to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms. ANEEJ is the anchor for the Anti-Corruption cluster under the SCALE project working with eight cluster organizations across six states and Abuja.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Palladium has adopted the cluster approach to identify possible areas of networking, advocacy, lobbying, civic engagement and policy dialogue and we are building that collective action that will put pressure on those institutions that need reforms and at the same time when those institutions are established, there is need for implementation and for implementation to happen there is the need for some level of public awareness.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the approaches we are going to be adopting and where the reforms is working we would like to scale it up by using the passivity impact and bringing the result to bear in our advocacy work,\u201d he added\n\nOn the issue of lack of accountability and transparency, he noted that it has been governance challenge, stressing, \u201cit is not just in the PADECS, oil and Gas commission alone because there have been reports and assessments that have shown that 13 percent oil money going to all the oil producing states are not properly managed well because of lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\u201cThere are research that have now demonstrated that when there is absence of transparency the tendency is to have accountability impaired. Our message through this project is that we want to work with government agencies to see how the oil and gas commission established to manage this 13 percent are properly run and then they are able to achieve their goal so that people\u2019s livelihood will improve and there will be transparency and accountability in programmes they carry out.\n\n\u201cWhen that is done, there will obviously be developments happening in the region and this conflict and crises we are seeing engulfing the entire region will reduce dramatically,\u201d Rev. Ugolor added.\n\nHe further disclosed that ANEEJ has the history of working in the region in the past 20 years, and has developed governance index which is systemizing where there are possible improvement and opportunity to engage in those selected states which are just pilot states and when it is successful it would be scaled to the entire region and eventually impact across the country.\n\nWhile expressing profound gratitude to USAID through Palladium for providing ANEEJ cluster the grant to undertake this very important project as a very critical time of the nation\u2019s democratic match, Rev Ugolor added that \u201cOur cluster will also advocate for the mainstreaming of anti- corruption issues into the country\u2019s upcoming 2023 general elections discourse.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the inception meeting provided the platform for the stakeholders who lauded the initiative of ANEEJ the opportunity to buy in to the project because of its timeliness to curb the huge deficit being experienced in the region which has translated to infrastructural decay and wanton profligacy by some Nigerians who fed fat at the expense of the tax payers.\n\nIn the past, ANEEJ was known for coming from the confrontational background, throwing stones. The Civil Society Organizations and Nigerians are quite aware of some of the actions taken, such as demanding the sack of Alison Madueke as the Minister for Petroleum, and other battles against corruption\n\nBut a time came, according to the Deputy Director of ANEEJ, Leo Atakpu that they now have to adopt what works in other climes apart from the stone throwing approach even though it is also helpful. They had to use a method which will deliver a better result and they arrived at the conclusion that collaborating with other stakeholders using global initiatives together, like the open government partnership that bring all stakeholders together on the table to procreate policies and drive the implementation with them has been found to be very useful in delivering results.\n\nAn Assistant Director of Community and Rural Development in the NDDC, Mrs. Ebi Ake who was delighted to be invited for the meeting said the commission is predisposed to the agenda of the meeting and more inclined to the social inclusiveness that will bring about the much needed reforms in the region.\n\nWhile pouring encomiums on ANEEJ, the NDDC Assistant Director noted that the commission will be ready to continue the engagement because of its commitment to whatever will bring succor to the region\n\nShe was explicit in her choice of words, when she said that with such engagement a lot would be achieved at the National Assembly where critical decisions concerning the region are being taken by the representatives of the people.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate what ANEEJ is doing, we are here because we want to further the engagement in whatever that will bring succor to the region and create a sense of responsibility amongst institutions and partnering with persons that have good intentions for Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cWe know what we have been going through as a region, because of the way things are, we are looking at and ensuring that the NDDC constitutional review, the act that set it up need to be looked at again and see how we can meet up with international best practices in service delivery. Having to associate with ANEEJ we know that we would be able to achieve that at the National Assembly,\u201d she enthused.\n\nIn the same vein, a key stakeholder in the NDDC and a Civil Society Organization activist, Patterson Ogon who expressed optimism that the result of the project will be positive, advised that all hands must be on deck to improve the lives of the people in the region.\n\n\u201cWe commend ANEEJ for what they are doing and we want more stakeholders and development partners to key in to what ANEEJ is doing because it is a collective enterprise. We are certain it is going to be positive at the end of the day to translate to a better livelihood for the people.\n\nAlso, a representative of the chairman of Delta State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Communities, DESOGPADEC, Mr. Bayo Iyalaju commended ANEEJ for such a platform to discuss about corruption and he assured that the commission will be ready to Partner on this project to deal with corruption.\n\nOn behalf of the cluster members, Mrs. Onose Matha appreciated ANEEJ for working with the cluster organizations on the anti-corruption project noting that they are very anxious to see what is in the package for them in the next two years that the project will last.\n\nThe representative of Mr. Sulayman Dawodu, Executive Secretary of Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee, Joshua Dada disclosed that they have a good working relationship with ANEEJ Executive Director, Rev David Ugolor, adding that they are looking forward to working at the legislative reform of the project.\n\n\u201cWe supervise criminal justice in Nigeria with particular interest in anti-corruption that has been the path we have thread with ANEEJ\n\nThe interactive session was in-depth as Civil Society Organizations represented made indelible inputs during the meeting. For instance, Comrade Taiwo from Publish what you pay, observed that the theory of change presented by Deputy Director of ANEEJ, Leo Atakpu captured the inclusiveness of the project and Ismail Opeyemi from 24 Century advised on the intentional involvement of youths who are critical stakeholders.\n\nIn the words of Anne Bisi Ojugo, representing Joint Association of persons with Disability, JONAPWD, the persons with disability have never had it so good because they are always been carried along by ANEEJ.\n\n\u201cWe thank ANEEJ for including the people with disability in this project, we have never had it so good.

          "title": "Saving public tertiary education in Nigeria",
          "text": "For several years now, the public tertiary education space in Nigeria has been afflicted by a rash of industrial actions arising from the displeasure of academics and other stakeholders in the system over the inability of government to honour collective bargaining agreements and give a jolt of life to the sector.\n\nThe latest experience of this disruption in the academic calendar of public tertiary institutions began in February when the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities, ASUU resumed its warning strike action that it had earlier suspended.\n\nPut I perspective, the latest action by ASUU has been seen in most quarters as one that was seriously avoidable given that the academics and the government had reached a compromise of sorts after the last bout of strike which had resulted in an agreement that many hoped would have been the beginning of a conclusive resolution of the recurring disputes. What was then needed was to implement the outcome of that compromise which the academics now insist has not been done. And for the better part of seven weeks, the institutions have in the immediate, remained cold rooms for study purposes.\n\nBeyond the immediate, the net outcome of this rash of strike actions then has been the stultification of academic activities and massive frustration for students and parents.\n\nBeyond these also are the collateral damages that have come into the mix. They include the challenge of securing enduring quality for the system in a world where tertiary education is evidently a universal engagement where global best practices are the norm. There is also the issue of the continuing migration of many students who ordinarily should be receiving their tertiary education in-country but who have been forced by factors, including the instability in the educational calendar, to seek admission and study opportunities outside the country.\n\nThere is also the sheer range of economic losses that the country suffers on account of the large numbers of Nigerians that are forced to go abroad to study. As CBN records would readily confirm, this is a major source of pressure on the nations foreign exchange position as the volume of dollars being sought by the Nigerians studying abroad continues to soar.\n\nEven more worrisome is the fact that government tends to be lackadaisical, unconcerned and indifferent about taking prompt and serious action to address the entire situation. When the strike first broke in the current dispensation, the attitude of government officials was to feign ignorance of the action. When they finally stepped in to presumably address it, the focus has been on trying to intellectually shoot down the positions being canvassed by the striking lecturers as if this is a lecture room debate. There is no sense of urgency; no show of empathy, compassion and consideration for hurting students, distraught parents and a continually hemorrhaging nation.\n\nIn the past there have been several suggestions, including one that public office holders be forced to compulsorily educate their children and wards within the countrys public tertiary educational system. While this has been shot down at the National Assembly the fact remains that there is still a large dose of indifference of public sector personnel to the plight of Nigerians who work in and are supposed to derive benefits from the system.\n\nOn their part, lecturers and students have been criticised for not being realistic in their opposition to raising fees in the system as a way of increasing funding. But even this point is neither here nor there as specific proposals and cushioning effects in this regard first have to be put on the table by those promoting them. For example, rather than simply ask students and their parents to just go and find any fees that are presumably denominated as market-efficient rates, can proper steps be taken to ensure that even as those adjustments are being proposed, there are also corollary proposals to address the question of a revamped Students Loans Board that would undertake to ensure that those who bring evidence of an inability to pay the revamped fees get to secure low interest loans to fund their studies.\n\nThis newspaper reminds government that it is its responsibility to get the system to work and therefore calls for everything to be done within the next two weeks towards ensuring that the schools are opened once again for full and uninterrupted studies.",
          "summary": "For several years now, the public tertiary education space in Nigeria has been afflicted by a rash of industrial actions arising from the displeasure of academics and other stakeholders in the system over the inability of government to honour collective bargaining agreements and give a jolt of life to the sector.\nThe latest experience of this disruption in the academic calendar of public tertiary institutions began in February when the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities, ASUU resumed its warning strike action that it had earlier suspended.\nAnd for the better part of seven weeks, the institutions have in the immediate, remained cold rooms for study purposes.\nThey include the challenge of securing enduring quality for the system in a world where tertiary education is evidently a universal engagement where global best practices are the norm.\nIn the past there have been several suggestions, including one that public office holders be forced to compulsorily educate their children and wards within the countrys public tertiary educational system.",

          "title": "Tension mounts over Lekki Tollgate reopening",
          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nIf not properly handled the proposed reopening of Lekki Toll gate may prove a sticky one for the administration of Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State.\n\nLast Friday, Abiodun Alabi, commissioner of police in the state warned citizens planning to converge at the Toll gate to protest to shelve the idea, saying much as they have rights to protest, the state Police Command will not take kindly to attempts to infringe on the rights of others in the name of protest.\n\nThis subtle sabre rattling on the part of the police command in the state comes amidst meetings with stakeholders by the Lagos officials, where majority of speakers voiced their opposition to reopening, even as the representatives of Lagos State pleaded for understanding. The spectre of trouble hovers, and crisis looms over the polar views held on the matter by the government and the people.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2020, as #Endsaars protests which started as ripples of discontent against police brutality \u2013 especially its special branch responsible for robbery \u2013 raged across the country, rapping the knuckles of Nigeria\u2019s state actors lost sleep and became jittery. Then, wave after wave of soft pressure on the protesters, which included the deployment of street urchins to scuttle the protests failed to make their mark, before force was deployed.\n\nOn the night of October 20, 2020, while young Nigerian protesters sat at the Lekki Toll Gate, wrapped in the national flag and singing the national anthem, a hail of bullets cut loose from guns procured with their taxes, felling about 11 of them in the process while leaving others with horrific injuries. About a year later,\n\nresponsibility for the bloodbath, which effectively ended the protest was placed at the doorstep of the Nigerian police and the Nigerian army.\n\nIn scorching findings penned by the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led judicial panel of inquiry set up by the Lagos State Government to investigate the disturbances, the killings were poignantly described as a massacre. But that was not before the Lekki Concession Company, operators of the Lekki Toll Gate, where the killings happened, was indicted.\n\nThe panel was unequivocal and unsparing in its findings that the company lent a leprous hand to those who carried out the massacre.\n\nRecently, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, announced plans by the Lagos State Government to open the Lekki Toll Gate closed for over 18 months since the massacre. Pegging the planned opening for April 1, 2022, Omotoso said operators of the facility had huge debts to pay.\n\nOmotoso puts the debts at N11.6 billion to local lenders and about $31.1 million to foreign lenders. He also announced that about 500 workers with families to feed had been affected by the closure. But Omotoso said nothing about the blood debts owed by the Lekki Concession Company for its complicity in the killing of October 20, 2020. This, Omotoso, conveniently glossed over.\n\n\u201cFor money, reopening Lekki Toll gate without the state paying adequate compensations to victims and publicly apologizing is not the path to go\u201d, said Professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist.\n\nHe told this newspaper that reopening \u201cought to be the last on the menu.\n\n\u201cThe first is to come clean by accepting responsibility for what happened, and paying adequate compensation, then the state can call a meeting of stakeholders to negotiate and haggle on how to reopen.\u201d\n\nBen Adamson, a lawyer told Business Hallmark that \u201cI think this administration should have shown more sensitivity and compassion, placing profits above every other thing is not the best. We are talking about the feeling of Nigerians, their psyche was assaulted at the same Lekki, and we are yet to resolve this, only for the government to be talking of reopening the toll gate.\u201d\n\nIn the past one week, the Lagos State Government has been intensifying its plea to the people of the state, especially residents of Lekki and Ikoyi, to show understanding ahead of the proposed reopening of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge toll plaza by the Lekki Concession Company Limited.\n\nAccording to a statement on Wednesday, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso; Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederick Oladehinde and Commissioner for Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi, disclosed this during a stakeholders meeting held in Lagos.\n\nOmotoso and his counterparts assured the residents that the government will look into all the requests and recommendations made by the stakeholders which included the President of Lekki Estates Residents and Stakeholders Association, Olorogun James Emadoye; human rights activists, the media and several other residents of Lekki and respond appropriately.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to seek your understanding as a government about the matter at hand. We are also citizens of Nigeria. We are all Lagosians. I have listened to all of you talking about our rights, privileges and how government should be responsible for everything. I also feel that as citizens, we should have some responsibilities.\n\n\u201cLagos is a city of about 25 million people and out of the 25 million people there are about six million taxpayers and among six million taxpayers, only 4.2 million are active taxpayers.\n\n\u201cSo, let us reflect on all these things. I know how people feel and I understand what has been said but I believe that the matter at hand is about seeking your understanding. It is a matter of showing some compassion for people who have one thing or another to do with this company.\u201d\n\nOladehinde explained the decision of the government to re-open the toll plaza was not to punish people but to create an enabling environment for more jobs through private sector participation.\n\n\u201cWhat Lagos State is trying to do is to create an enabling environment to create more jobs and when you create more jobs. We should not be shortsighted. The only way to create jobs is to create an environment where we can attract the private sector to build more infrastructure in the state. Let us look at the issue from the view that we are trying to resuscitate the economy of Lagos State,\u201d he said.\n\nElegushi, said the purpose of the stakeholders meeting was to engage key stakeholders on the matter of reopening the toll plaza and appealed for cooperation from the people to work together with the government.\n\nThe Managing Director of LCC, Mr Yomi Omomuwasan, on his own hinted on the necessity for the resumption of operations so as not to continue to default on its payment of local and international loans as well as to cater for the welfare of its workers.\n\nLCC has also introduced new technology and innovations to make movement at the toll plaza seamless and faster for commuters.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians of all hue had asked the Lagos State government to halt the April 1 planned reopening of tolling of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge by the Lekki Concession Company Limited, LCC. This comes as appeal from Lagos State government calling for understanding on the side of the people mounts.\n\nHowever, the residents said they want the reopening halted based on the harsh economic situation in the country. They said the tolling would aggravate their hardship. Some Nigerians also took to social media to demand justice for people killed and injured at Lekki Toll Gate during the #EndSars protest.",

The plan is that once it comes to the South even the southeast governors will support the southsouth aspirant to emerge.\n\nAs we speak the entire 37man team has come under intense pressure to zone.\n\nI still submit that zoning at this late hour will breed rancour, division, resentment and bitterness. The appropriate thing to do if we actually want to achieve fairness, equity as well as merit and competence, is to choose a CONSENSUS CANDIDATE FROM THE SOUTH-EAST.\n\nTherefore let us choose National Consensus over Zoning.\n\nA lot of PDP members erroneously believe that whoever is our presidential candidate will easily win the election. Let the PDP not position itself to snatch loss over victory in the 2023 elections.\n\nI speak because I love my party and have paid monumental sacrifices for my immeasurable loyalty.

          "title": "[Breaking] Resignation call: Amaju Pinnick adamant, convenes NFF executive committee meeting",
          "text": "Repeated calls by football-loving Nigerians for Amaju Pinnick to resign as President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) seem to have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nThis is as Pinnick convened and presided over NFF executive committee meeting one week after the surprise ouster of Nigeria\u2019s Super Eagles from the 2022 World Cup scheduled for Qatar.\n\nShortly after the disastrous non-qualification from the mundial, Nigerians including sports editors, ex-internationals, pundits among other stakeholders had harmoniously demanded immediate Pinnick\u2019s and other board members\u2019 resignation.\n\nRather, the NFF board went to meet on Tuesday, and subsequently issued a communique.\n\nThe communique reads, \u201cThe Executive Committee tendered unreserved apology to the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria for the inability of the Super Eagles to win a ticket to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. It praised the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR for his personal presence and apologised that the team faltered in the quest for a ticket to Qatar.2) For his steadfastness, exemplary leadership and warm relationship with the NFF since assuming office and especially for the FIFA World Cup playoff matches, the Committee commended, appreciated and applauded the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cThe Committee further commended the Honourable Minister for his savvy in convening the meeting held among the Presidency, Sports Ministry and NFF on Monday, 4th March 2022 to review the unfortunate outcome of the match with Ghana and agree concrete steps on how to reinvigorate the Super Eagles and indeed Nigeria Football going forward. It noted that the meeting was very cordial, as well as established and appreciated the fact that all that was needed to be done and/or provided the team and the technical crew to ensure a positive outcome on the pitch against Ghana was delivered, and in a most professional manner. In addition, unique motivational strategy was put in place to spur the coaches and the players, such as offering the technical crew a two-and-half year contract. The standard agreement NFF had in place with the players that they will share 35% of the qualifying bonus Nigeria will earn by participating at the Qatar 2022 World Cup was also emphasised.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee regretted the death of Dr Joseph Kabungo, appointed as the FIFA Doping Officer for the Nigeria/Ghana FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Playoff match in Abuja on 29th March 2022. It reiterated that Dr Kabungo died as a result of sudden cardiac arrest, as attested to by the autopsy report, and disclosed that his body had been flown to Zambia for final rites accompanied by his family members who were flown to Nigeria two days after the unfortunate incident. It prayed that God grants the soul of Dr Kabungo eternal rest and for fortitude for his family and the Zambia Football Family to bear the big loss. The Committee equally commended the General Secretary for diligence and proficiency in handling issues surrounding the tragic development and also with regards to the match organization.\n\n\u201cAfter exhaustive deliberations, introspection and admission that the outpouring of emotions by fans and stakeholders over the FIFA World Cup miss was legitimate, the Executive Committee urged caution and patience, and assured that in tandem with the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, decisive steps will be taken in the next few days to reposition Nigeria Football in several areas, including the National Teams. It also disclosed that in line with the statutes, roadmap for new elections into the NFF Board will be designed at the Annual General Assembly (AGA) of the NFF once the ex parte injunction suspending the Congress from meeting is vacated. It can be recalled that the AGA to set the roadmap for the next NFF election cycle was statutorily scheduled to hold on 17th December, 2021 in Lagos but an ex parte court order was served on the NFF from a Federal High Court in Bayelsa State to stop the meeting. The NFF had since January 2022 approached the court to vacate the order and the next sitting is scheduled for 26th April 2022. The committee has now proposed June 2022 for the AGA to statutorily set the roadmap for the NFF elective congress provided the order is vacated accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee mandated its Technical and Development Sub-Committee to, within the next 5 days, make recommendations to the Executive Committee on coaching crews for the Super Eagles, the CHAN team, the U20 Boys (Flying Eagles) and the U17 Boys (Golden Eaglets) ahead of upcoming assignments. This is to ensure preparations for the next qualifying tournaments and championships commence in earnest.\n\n\u201cThe Committee hailed the Super Falcons for its qualification for the 12th edition of the Women Africa Cup of Nations taking place in Morocco in the month of July, and promised to provide the team ample support for adequate preparation for the Championship, aware that the event also serves as qualifying tournament for the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup finals. The Super Falcons\u2019 contingent departed Nigeria on Tuesday night for Canada for a two-match tour with that country\u2019s Women\u2019s National Team, and will camp in Morocco for the African Championship.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee also commended the U20 Women National Team, Falconets, for its qualification for this year\u2019s FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup taking place in Costa Rica in the month of August, and charged the U17 girls, Flamingos to put in the hard work necessary to win a ticket to this year\u2019s FIFA U17 Women\u2019s World Cup taking place in India in the month of October.",

All the activities are in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\u201cSo far, two out of the 14 activities in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities have been successfully accomplished. The Notice of Election was published on 28th February 2022, while nomination forms have been made available on the Commission\u2019s website since 1st March 2022 for political parties to download and issue to their candidates.\n\n\u201cThe next activity is the conduct of primaries by political parties in line with the dictates of Section 84 of the Electoral Act for which the Timetable and Schedule of Activities provides a period of 61 days (4th April to 3rd June 2022).\n\n\u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that parties must adhere strictly to the principles of internal democracy, drawing from their constitutions, guidelines, the Electoral Act and other Regulations and Guidelines issued by the Commission. Their candidates for the 1,491 constituencies for which elections will be conducted in 2023 must emerge from democratic, transparent and valid primaries, in line with the provisions of Sections 29 and 84 of the Electoral Act, 2022. Where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of the Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cAs required by law, the Commission shall monitor the primaries of each political party that provides the required legal notice in line with Sections 82 (1) and (5) of the Electoral Act. Failure of a political party to notify the Commission of any convention or congress convened for the purpose of nominating candidates for any of the elective offices specified in the Act shall render the convention or congress invalid.\n\n\u201cPrimaries must be conducted in the various constituencies as provided in Section 84 of the Electoral Act as it is a violation of the law to conduct primaries outside the constituencies for which parties are nominating candidates. The Commission will not monitor such primaries and their outcome will not be accepted.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are enjoined to avoid acrimonious primaries that could result in unnecessary litigations that may lead to failure to nominate and field candidates for elections in some constituencies.\u201d",

He said it was not clear whether he and Russian President Vladimir Putin would speak directly.\n\nRussian news agency Interfax cited a deputy Russian foreign minister as saying talks, which last convened on Friday, were continuing via video link. There was no update from the Ukrainian side.\n\nZelenskiy said earlier that at least 300 civilians had been killed in Bucha and that many more dead were likely to be found in other areas. He said he would address the United Nations Security Council later in the day as he builds support for an investigation into the killings.\n\nSATELLITE IMAGES\n\nRussia denied that its forces had carried out any atrocities and said it would present \u201cempirical evidence\u201d to the U.N. Security Council meeting proving its forces were not involved.\n\nBut satellite images of Bucha taken weeks ago showed bodies of civilians on a street, a private U.S. company said, undercutting Russian claims that the scene was staged.\n\nMaxar Technologies provided nine images taken of Bucha on March 18, 19 and 31 to Reuters. At least four of the images appear to show bodies on Yablonska Street in the town, which was occupied by Russian forces until about March 30. read more\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Putin and Washington will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council. read more\n\nAt the weekend, Reuters reporters in Bucha saw several bodies apparently shot at close range, along with makeshift burials and a mass grave, but could not independently verify the number of dead or who was responsible.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said he spoke with U.N.

          "text": "The first trial for atrocities committed in Darfur has opened at the International Criminal Court (ICC), nearly 20 years after violence tore through the Sudanese region.\n\nA suspected former leader of the pro-government Janjaweed militia has been charged with 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nAli Muhammad Ali Abd-al-Rahman denies the charges.\n\nSudanese human rights activists have described the case as historic.\n\n\u201c[Tuesday] is a momentous day for victims and survivors in Darfur who never stopped fighting to see the day the cycle of impunity is broken,\u201d human rights lawyer Mossaad Mohamed Ali said.\n\n\u201cWe hope the trial against Abd-al-Rahman will shed light on his responsibility for the horrendous crimes, in particular sexual crimes, committed by him and the government-backed Janjaweed militias under his command,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, is the first person to be tried by the ICC over a conflict that left about 300,000 people dead and more than two million homeless.\n\nSudan\u2019s former President Omar al-Bashir has so far evaded arrest over the conflict. He is wanted on charges of genocide and war crimes, which he denies the charges. He is currently in custody in Sudan after being ousted in a coup in 2019.\n\nMr Abd-al-Rahman surrendered to the ICC in 2020 after 13 years on the run.\n\nHe is alleged to have participated in attacks on civilians in four towns in Darfur between August 2003 and March 2004.\n\nDr Adeeb Yousif, a former governor in Darfur who was involved in the investigation of Mr Abd-al-Rahman at the time, told the BBC why the Janjaweed leader should be in court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen what happened by my naked eyes in regard to crimes that he committed in central Darfur, attacking villages, burning villages, killing people, burning people, burning children, rape of women and girls.\u201d\n\nThe ICC accuses Mr Abd-al-Rahman and militias under his command of rape, torture, killing and pillaging.\n\n\u201cHe is alleged to have implemented the counter-insurgency strategy of the Government of Sudan that also resulted in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur,\u201d the ICC said.\n\n\u201cHe is also alleged to have enlisted fighters, armed, funded and provided food and other supplies to the Janjaweed militia under his command,\u201d it added.\n\nDuring previous court appearances, Mr Abd-al-Rahman said he was the victim of mistaken identity, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nThe trial comes amid an increase in violence in Darfur since a joint United Nations and African Union peace force ended its operations in the region more than a year ago.\n\nConflict first erupted in Darfur in 2003 when mostly non-Arabs took up arms against the government, complaining about discrimination and a lack of development.\n\nThe government retaliated by mobilising mostly Arab militias, known as the Janjaweed, to fight the rebels, unleashing violence that caused global outrage.\n\nHundreds of villages were burnt and pillaged, with widespread accusations of ethnic cleansing against the civilian population.\n\nBBC",
