          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nA senior psychiatrist at the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Tomi Alalade says good education may help reduce the risk of dementia.\n\nAlalade said studies have confirmed that having a good education and embracing lifelong learning could help reduce dementia risk.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, dementia is an umbrella term for several diseases affecting memory, other cognitive abilities and behaviour that interfere significantly with a person\u2019s ability to maintain their activities of daily living.\n\nDementia, WHO stated, is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour, and the ability to perform everyday activities.\n\nIt noted that while around 50 million people globally have dementia, there are also nearly 10 million new cases every year.\n\nDr. Alalade said having lower educational status may be a risk factor to having Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAlalade spoke on Morning Crossfire, a live radio programme on Nigeria Info on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt has been shown from studies that going to school or having a good educational status is a bit protective against Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThough, the risk rises as you age however good educational status may be a protective factor to it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe psychiatrist also noted that women are more affected by Alzheimer\u2019s than men.\n\n\u201cBecause of the life expectancy-females grow older than the males and since we say Alzheimer\u2019s is related to increasing age, that is why we could have more females presenting later in life with Alzheimer\u2019s than the male,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, added that research has shown that oestrogen may help to protect the brain from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAccording to him, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of progressive dementia, and having memory loss alone doesn\u2019t mean one has dementia.\n\nHe added that about 60-65 percent of dementia cases are Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cIn simple terms, dementia means this person can\u2019t remember things the way he used to and there\u2019s a decline in his cognitive capacity,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe explained that other types of dementia are vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia and mixed dementia.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is complaining that he can\u2019t remember things and it becomes progressive or regular, it could be dementia.\n\n\u201cThere could be a problem with speech over time or problem with recognising body parts, there could be a problem with language but majorly, it is the progressive decline in memory function that is common,\u201d he said.\n\nAlalade noted that age is a risk factor for developing dementia.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, dementia occurs in the elderly age group from 60 years and above.\n\n\u201cHowever, with early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it could happen between the ages of 40-65 years.\n\n\u201cFamily history could be a contributory factor such that if you have someone in the family that suffers from dementia, it could contribute to you having it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that down syndrome is also a risk factor for developing dementia.\n\n\u201cIn looking at the symptoms apart from memory, psychosis and undue suspiciousness could also come in.\n\n\u201cFor some of them, they may start having hallucinations and they will start hearing strange voices, some may have serious belief, there may also be a delusion.\n\n\u201cFor some, there\u2019s a change in their personality because of dementia. There could be a change in the way they relate.\n\n\u201cAt some point, there are behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. They could become agitated. They could have urinary incontinence. There could be a decline in their total functioning,\u201d Alalade said.\n\nAccording to WHO the total number of people with dementia is projected to reach 82 million in 2030 and 152 in 2050. This increase, WHO said, is attributable to the rising numbers of people with dementia living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe UN agency said there is no treatment currently available to cure dementia or to alter its progressive course but noted that numerous new treatments are being investigated in various stages of clinical trials.\n\n\u201cHowever, much can be offered to support and improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers and families. The principal goals for dementia care are early diagnosis in order to promote early and optimal management; optimizing physical health, cognition, activity and well-being.\n\n\u201cIdentifying and treating accompanying physical illness, detecting and treating challenging behavioural and psychological symptoms and providing information and long-term support to carers,\u201d WHO stated.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2026As APC zones guber ticket to Enugu East Sen. District\n\nThe people of Enugu East Senatorial District of Enugu State comprising leaders of political, religious and traditional institutions, on Thursday, converged on the popular Michael Okpara Square, #Enugu, for a Mega Rally, requesting #Governor Ifeanyi #Ugwuanyi to uphold the long established rotational template with regards to the Office of the Governor of the state by lending his support for the district to produce his successor in 2023.\n\nSpeaking at the well-attended rally, themed \u201cOganiru Enugu East Senatorial District\u201d, the Convener and Speaker of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Edward Ubosi said that the only agenda of the gathering was to demand for the governorship seat of the state in 2023 in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice, stressing that it is the turn of Enugu East Senatorial District going by the long established rotational template in the state.\n\nThe Speaker who applauded Gov. Ugwuanyi for attending the rally stated that it was the unanimous stance of the people of Enugu East Senatorial District and beyond that the governor has a major role to play in the choice of his successor since his predecessors enjoyed such privilege during their tenures as governors of the state.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, your own will not be different. We are waiting for you to take a decision on your choice of your successor from any of the six local government areas of Enugu East Senatorial District and we will support the person overwhelmingly\u201d, Rt. Hon. Ubosi said.\n\nAligning with the Speaker\u2019s speech, the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu State, Dr. Ben Nwoye announced that the party has zoned its governorship position in 2023 to Enugu East Senatorial District.\n\nDr. Nwoye eulogized Gov. Ugwuanyi for his uncommon leadership qualities as a peaceful, humble and development-oriented governor, saying: \u201cWhen you have peace you have order; when you have peace you have development, you (Ugwuanyi) are a peaceful governor and you have brought peace to our people\u201d.\n\nThe APC State Chairman emphasized that the governor\u2019s presence at the rally was a prayer answered towards the quest for his successor to come from Enugu East Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, the fact that you are here, means that you have answered our prayers in our midst. It means that you have agreed to endorse someone from Enugu East Senatorial District come 2023.\n\n\u201cWe (APC) have zoned the governorship candidate to Enugu East Senatorial District. We are following the PDP people to beg you to also nominate and zone their governorship candidate to Enugu East Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cSo, Your Excellency, you will do the right thing. You will anoint someone from Enugu East Senatorial District; if it goes to APC, you anoint someone from APC; if it goes to PDP, you anoint someone from PDP\u201d, Nwoye said.\n\nIn his speech, the former Governor of old Anambra State and the former Senator who represented Enugu East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Jim Nwobodo, expressed optimism that Gov. Ugwuanyi will endorse his successor from the zone, pointing out that \u201cGburugburu is a peace-maker; Gburugburu entrusted Enugu State to the hand of God; Gburugburu will give Ndi Enugu East Senatorial District governor in 2023; we are only waiting for the time to come to know who will be the next governor from our zone\u201d.\n\nExpressing his confidence in Gov. Ugwuanyi, Senator Nwododo maintained that it is the turn of Enugu East Senatorial District to produce the next governor of Enugu State in 2023, appealing to other senatorial districts to support the choice candidate of the governor from the zone when the time comes.\n\nNwobodo added that the candidate should be someone \u201cwho will be as humble and peaceful like you (Ugwuanyi) and also a governor of the entire Enugu State not governor of Enugu East Senatorial Zone, as Ugwuanyi is today the governor of Enugu State, not governor of Nsukka\u201d.\n\nLending his support, the former President of the Senate, Senator Ken Nnamani endorsed the stance of the people of Enugu East Senatorial District at the rally and commended the organizers of the event for galvanizing the people of the zone to come and appraise the existing rotational principle of zoning in Enugu State.\n\nRepresented by the Ambassador-designate to the Republic of Poland, Major General Christian Ugwu (Rtd.), Sen. Nnamani lauded Gov. Ugwuanyi for the peace being enjoyed in Enugu State, expressing confidence that the governor\u2019s disposition to peace and good governance will guarantee a peaceful transition in 2023, where a candidate from Enugu East Senatorial District will be elected governor of the state.\n\nIn their separate goodwill messages, the members of the National and State Assemblies from the zone, the Council Chairmen, the Clergy, traditional rulers, State Executive Council, among others, equally paid glowing tributes to Gov.

          "text": "Anthony Joshua, the WBO world heavyweight champion, has recounted his journey from boarding school in Nigeria to jail and how Mike Tyson inspired him to become a boxer.\n\nIn the July 2021 issue of British Vogue, the 31-year-old Watford-born boxer narrated how he moved to Nigeria briefly at the age of 11 after his mother decided to establish a business in the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known Africa as the motherland. Like, out in the world is England, but in my house is Nigeria. My parents are still very attached to their roots,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they were born, that\u2019s where their friends are. They\u2019ve always travelled backwards and forwards. When I was 11, my mum set up a business there and we went, too.\u201d\n\nJoshua said he was enrolled in a boarding school where he spent nearly one academic session before he returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nHe described the condition as \u201ctough,\u201d with \u201cno-nonsense\u201d teachers drilling austerity into the lives of the students.\n\n\u201cI spent about nine months in a boarding school,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re woken at five in the morning and if you don\u2019t wake up, the teachers burst through the door. You go and fetch your water, shower, iron your clothes, and then school starts.\u201d\n\nShortly after Joshua returned to the UK, his parents divorced while his life thereafter pivoted for an unattractive end.\n\nA product of a broken home, he suffered a bit of crack himself.\n\nThe shattered mirror of his mind couldn\u2019t focus on just one thing, so he \u201cstopped all sports\u201d and sought the false calmness that comes with \u201csmoking\u201d which eventually landed him in jail.\n\n\u201cI had left school, and I was a Jack the Lad, you know what I mean? My mum had moved to London. I didn\u2019t want to leave Watford, so I was moving from one auntie\u2019s house to another auntie\u2019s house. Then I got my own little place when I was like 16, 17, and I stopped all sports and stuff like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I started, you know, smoking a bit, doing my own thing. And then I got banned from my area in Watford. I wasn\u2019t allowed to go back. I was in jail for a little bit, and on tag for about 14 months.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving prison, Joshua said Ben Ileyemi, his cousin, taught him the basics of boxing. Amidst all the introduction to the pugilistic stances and punch combinations, he watched Tyson \u2014 who was then the undisputed world heavyweight champion \u2014 closely.\n\n\u201cYeah. When I moved from Watford into London, I started chilling with my cousin, and he was boxing at the time. I was driving, so I\u2019d take him to the gym,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was doing weights, banging up my triceps. Then after a little while, my cousin gave me some shorts and boots and taught me how to wrap my hand. Then I discovered Mike Tyson.\u201d\n\nWhile the jaw-shifting jabs and gut-busting hooks of Tyson attracted the rest of the world, it was, however, the unattractive side of the American story that caught Joshua\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cI saw this kid who had been about 13-years-old getting into a whole heap of trouble, from a bad background, where you\u2019re deemed the worst in society, who became one of the most praised champions that the world has ever seen, all through hard work and discipline. I felt like I could do the same thing. So I took boxing a little bit more seriously,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere we grew up in Watford, it wasn\u2019t about being rough \u2013 obviously you had to back yourself \u2013 but we were hustlers. So I took the hustler\u2019s mindset from Watford and I just put it into boxing and navigated my way through with good manners. I walked into the gym still on tag \u2013 I had to rush out at 7:40 pm to be home by eight o\u2019clock.\n\n\u201cThree years later I went to the Olympics and represented Great Britain and got a gold medal. It happened really quick. But it just showed real discipline. It\u2019s fine to fail, but don\u2019t get disheartened. Build, go again. That marathon mindset is what\u2019s got me through my boxing days and that\u2019s what I\u2019m still using as motivation now.\u201d\n\nJoshua will be returning to the ring in September against mandatory challenger Oleksandr Usyk, after the \u00a3200 million undisputed world heavyweight bout with Tyson Fury was hampered by a US court ruling.\n\nVogue UK",

          "text": "From Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin Kebbi and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nBandits stormed the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, yesterday, abducted yet to be ascertained number of students, five teachers and killed a policeman, in a mid day operation.\n\nMultiple sources said several students and security men who sustained various injuries were receiving care at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nCommissioner of Police in the state, Adeleke Adeyinka-Bode, confirmed the attack in Birnin Kebbi.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the attack took place and five teachers have been taken away, four male and one female, but the number of students abducted are not known yet.\n\nA parent, Mallam Monsur Yauri, explained that the bandits attacked the school in their hundreds on motorcycles and opened fire on the mobile police guarding the school.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, Adeleke Adeyinka, assured parents and guardians of students that the Command was following credible leads and intensifying efforts to track the assailants and ensure the rescue of the students and teachers. The command spokesman, SP Nafi\u2019u Abubakar, said in a statement that a team, comprising operatives from the Police Mobile Force, anti-kidnapping and counter-terrorism units have begun combing nearby forests, routes and suspected hideouts of the criminals.\n\nThe police boss assured that the command would do everything within its power to ensure the abducted persons are safely reunited with their families and perpetrators brought to book and appealed to residents to assist with prompt information that would aid in solving the crime and apprehending the criminals.\n\nNotwithstanding the assurance from the police, panic-stricken residents have begun mass exodus from the towns and communities in Yauri. At press time, no fewer than six villages had been deserted.\n\nAn activist from one of the villages, Mallam Muktar Yauri, told Daily Sun on phone that almost all the villagers have relocated for safety.\n\n\u201cAll the residents are running towards Yauri town for their protection. When the bandits attacked, about 200 of them, according to eyewitness, they were selective. They didn\u2019t pick student who were not matured. They overwhelmed the security officers in the school as they shot sporadically. Wallahi, our people are in trauma now in Yauri Emirate.\u201d\n\nState Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Umar Halidu Alhassan told Daily Sun on phone that yesterday\u2019s attack has unsettled residents.\n\n\u201cWallahi, we\u2019re not happy about this incident. It is unfortunate and all the stakeholders must rally round to protect our schools, our state and our people.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that such incident is happening in Zuru and Yauri axis. Government should take proactive measures to protect our schools, our students. Kebbi State has porous borders with neighbouring countries. Our government needs to do something about that because Zuru and Yauri Emirates have porous borders with even other states.\u201d\n\nChairman, House of Representatives Committee on Health Services, Tanko Sununu, who represents Ngaski/Shanga/Yauri Federal Constituency of Kebbi State, decried the insecurity in his constituency and called for the intervention of the Federal Government.\n\nThe lawmaker told journalists in Abuja that children and farmers in his constituency can no longer go to school or farm as a result of insecurity.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits numbering about 300, each with AK-47 and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency.\n\n\u201cThey had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, moving from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles and cattle. That has led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons into the headquarters of the Emirate in Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back and in the early hours of today (yesterday), they repeated what they had done earlier and they came into the constituency, sometime around 10.30 or thereabout.\u201d\n\nSununu called on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State.\n\n\u201cIt has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the back of River Niger. Our fear is that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj.

          "text": "\u2022IMF laments re-emergence of fuel subsidy\n\n\u2022Welcomes CBN\u2019s measures to unify exchange rates\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos, Francis Ndubuisi and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has warned that rather than being a positive development, the rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria.\n\nHe spoke just as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over the re-emergence of fuel subsidy in Nigeria in the face of the country\u2019s low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe Washington-based institution, however, welcomed recent moves by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to unify exchange rates, certifying Nigerian banks as being liquid and well-capitalised.\n\nKyari, at the virtual Citizens Energy Congress, tagged: \u201cSecuring a Sustainable Future Energy System through Strategy, Collaboration and Innovation,\u201d yesterday described the rising price of crude oil as a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d situation.\n\nHe added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC, and becoming a burden.\n\nThe forum was organised by DMG Events, a London-based Public Relations company, which said the occasion was to provide an opportunity for players to reset the energy agenda post- COVID-19 and connect the divergent and polarising perspectives.\n\nKyari put the comfort zone globally at $58-$60, saying that for the NNPC, anything above $70-$80 will create major distortions in the projections of the corporation and add more problems to the company.\n\nBrent crude, Nigeria\u2019s oil benchmark, is currently selling for over $74 and is likely to increase further in the coming days as the NNPC continues to battle the dilemma of shouldering the payment of petrol subsidy, which has made it unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nKyari expressed the concern that as the commodity prices rise, buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future, they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60.\n\n\u201cBut for us as a country, as prices go up, the burden of providing cheap fuel also increases and that\u2019s a challenge for us but on a net basis, you know, the high prices, as long as it doesn\u2019t exceed $70 to $80, it\u2019s okay for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria will have no problems supporting the restoration of about 5.8 million barrels a day that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) still has offline since the pandemic, due to the curbs in production quota imposed by the oil cartel.\n\nHe said adding that number to demand will stabilise and probably bring oil prices down to about $60 level or a little below $60, stressing that that\u2019s a comfort zone for every producing company or country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see them (Nigeria) having any difficulty agreeing to add additional volume to cushion the effect of these high prices for this period,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that Nigeria is already producing well below its capacity, because in early 2020, the country actually produced up to 2.4 million barrels of oil per day for both oil and condensates.\n\nWith declining investments in the oil sector, Kyari stated that in a short time, most likely the next five years, the world may experience an energy crisis if the current situation is not properly managed.\n\n\u201cBut we know that a number of things are going on in the transition journey at renewables. Many oil companies are transiting to renewables in the future. And that means that emphasis will be on gas and I see a very turbulent next five years and potentially some stability in the next 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the transition to renewables as a reality, adding that for Nigeria, what is clear is that the country is deficient in infrastructure and, therefore, needs resources from oil to exit poverty.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria, to transit means to go for a low-carbon option and move towards more gas development than the liquids, adding that in the long term, the country needs to find a way out of dependence on oil.\n\n\u201cRenewables are real and we are making efforts to go in that direction, but obviously, our first step is to develop our gas resources.\n\n\u201cIn this industry, you can\u2019t do anything except you have the financing and financing is now clearly constrained both in terms of available resources and the decision of some of the shareholders of some of the lending institutions,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that although everyone seems to be talking about peak oil, there is no reference to gas, which contains lower carbon.\n\nKyari said: \u201cEverybody is saying that in the next 10 years, we will get to peak oil. But nobody has said peak gas. And it\u2019s very difficult to distinguish the two because as you get peak oil, in many cases, you know, oil is produced alongside gas.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s possible, it can be in 10 years time but you also know that what we are doing today in the industry is also curtailing investment and meeting the transition target in 2050.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that in five years\u2019 time, you could be in a situation of shock and this shock will mean that people will have to put more money into producing the liquids and that means that it will defer the date for liquid oil and potentially pushing it by 20 to 30 years.\u201d\n\nRe-emergence of Fuel Subsidy Worrisome, Says IMF\n\nMeanwhile, the IMF has expressed concern over the re-emergence of fuel subsidy in Nigeria in the face of the country\u2019s low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF in a statement at the end of its staff virtual meeting with top Nigerian officials, said the views expressed in the statement were those of the IMF staff and did not represent those of the IMF\u2019s Executive Board.\n\nThe IMF team was led by IMF\u2019s Mission Chief for Nigeria, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, in the virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities, held from June 1st to June 8th, 2021, to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nAt the end of the visit, Rahman, in the statement, said the Nigerian economy had started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies. It reiterated the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\u201d\n\nIt stated that tax revenue collections in Nigeria were gradually recovering but with fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for COVID-19 vaccines, added to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the consolidated government was expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nIt added that following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in the fourth quarter (Q4 2020) and growth reached 0.5 per cent (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\nHowever, it said employment level in the country continued to fall dramatically and, together with other socio-economic indicators, remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u201cInflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.93 per cent, owing to high food price inflation. With the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued forex shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021,\u201d it added.\n\nIt anticipated that inflation in Nigeria would remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nDownside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the pandemic both globally and in Nigeria, it added.\n\n\u201cThe mission commended the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programme under the COVAX initiative, and strongly supported the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\n\u201cThe mission urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\n\u201cThe recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate are encouraging,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe mission recommended maintaining the momentum toward fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn the monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, the mission recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using the central bank or government bills of short-maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\n\u201cThe banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained. The extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalised except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability,\u201d it said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says banking sector remains liquid, well capitalised\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the federal government to keep reliance on overdrafts from the Central Bank Bank of Nigeria ((CBN) within legal limits.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution said this should be done while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nSection 38(1) of the CBN Act allows the apex bank to grant overdrafts to the federal government to address any temporary deficiency of budget revenue, with sub-section 2 providing that any outstanding overdraft shall not exceed 5 per cent of the previous year\u2019s actual revenue of the federal government.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s admonition was contained in a statement from preliminary findings of a virtual visit to Nigeria by its staff.\n\nAccording to the IMF, real gross domestic product (GDP) is recovering but unemployment and inflation remain elevated, noting that recent exchange rate measures were encouraging.\n\nIt, however, called for reforms to achieve a fully unified and market-clearing exchange rate, even as it expressed concern on the re-emergence of fuel subsidies, particularly in the context of low revenue mobilisation.\n\nThe IMF team led by Ms. Jesmin Rahman, the statement added, held virtual meetings with the Nigerian authorities between June 1 and 8, 2021 to discuss recent economic, financial developments and outlook.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigerian economy has started to gradually recover from the negative effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Following sharp output contractions in the second and third quarters, GDP growth turned positive in Q4 2020 and growth reached 0.5 per cent (y/y) in Q1 2021, supported by agriculture and services sectors.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the employment level continues to fall dramatically and together with other socio-economic indicators, is far below pre-pandemic levels. Inflation slightly decelerated in May but remained elevated at 17.9 per cent, owing to high food price inflation.\n\n\u201cWith the recovery in oil prices and remittance flows, the strong pressures on the balance of payments have somewhat abated, although imports are rebounding faster than exports and foreign investor appetite remains subdued resulting in continued FX shortage.\n\n\u201cThe incipient recovery in economic activity is projected to take root and broaden among sectors, with GDP growth expected to reach 2.5 per cent in 2021.\u201d\n\nThe IMF noted that inflation is expected to remain elevated in 2021, but likely to decelerate in the second half of the year to reach about 15.5 per cent, following the removal of border controls and the elimination of base effects from elevated food price levels.\n\nTax revenue collections, it observed, are gradually recovering, adding that: \u201cWith fuel subsidies resurfacing, additional spending for Covid-19 vaccines, and to address security challenges, the fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain elevated at 5.5 per cent of GDP,\u201d it said.\n\nThe multilateral financial institution stated that downside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, and the still uncertain course of the COVID-19 pandemic both globally and in Nigeria.\n\nWhile commending the authorities\u2019 measures to contain the transmission of Covid-19 in Nigeria, including the ongoing vaccination programmes under the COVAX initiative, it strongly expressed support to the authorities\u2019 efforts to acquire additional doses from countries with surplus stocks.\n\nHowever, it expressed its concern with the resurgence of fuel subsidies, reiterating the importance of introducing market-based fuel pricing mechanism and the need to deploy well-targeted social support to cushion any impact on the poor.\n\nThe IMF mission recommended stepping up efforts to strengthen tax administration to mobilise additional revenues and help address priority spending pressures.\n\nIt urged the authorities to keep reliance on CBN overdrafts for deficit financing within legal limits, while the government continues to make efforts to strengthen budget planning and public finance management practices to allow for flexible financing from domestic markets and better integration of cash and debt management.\n\nIt also described as encouraging the recent removal of the official exchange rate from the CBN website and measures to enhance transparency in the setting of the NAFEX exchange rate.\n\nThe IMF called for the sustenance of the momentum towards fully unifying all exchange rate windows and establishing a market-clearing exchange rate.\n\nOn monetary policy to strengthen the monetary targeting regime, it recommended integrating the interbank and debt markets and using central bank or government bills of short maturity as the main liquidity management tool, instead of the cash reserve requirements.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the Nigerian banking sector remains liquid and well-capitalised, while non-performing loans (NPLs) are contained.\n\nBut it advised that the extension of the moratorium on principal payments of qualifying credit facilities on a case-by-case basis through March 2022 should be limited to viable debtors with strong pre-crisis fundamentals.\n\n\u201cCBN stress tests purport that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized except in case of a severe deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it remains to be seen what share of forborne loans may turn non-performing as the impact of the pandemic abates. Since NPLs often rise at the later part of economic crisis, CBN\u2019s strong oversight remains critical to safeguarding financial sector stability.\n\n\u201cThe IMF mission would like to thank the authorities and other counterparts for the open and thoughtful discussions and excellent cooperation,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "When an eight-year-old Kamaru Usman left Nigeria for the United States in 1995, his young mind would never have conjured the fanfare that would herald his return to the country. He might have imagined the loving hands of members of his extended family patting his back, shoving for his suitcases, and tilting his head this way and that way to the amazement of how \u201cthe land of white man\u201d has changed their once little Kamarudeen. He might have even pictured himself smiling while telling them he\u2019s now a surgeon or a Wall Street lawyer or a certified engineer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut reality has the story different and better for the Auchi-born go-getter.\n\nWhen he returned to Nigeria 26 years later, it wasn\u2019t with fancy certificates but a gilded belt whose shimmering tells the tales of several contenders that Kamaru has unseasonably whooped en route to becoming Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Welterweight champion. Instead of a handful of relatives welcoming him, he was hosted by the vice-president of the country. He dined with a minister of the federation and went on a boat cruise with a governor. He left the country a twinkling little star, came back a nebula: the \u2018Nigerian Nightmare\u2019 considered one of the best pound-for-pound mixed martial artists in the world.\n\nWhen TheCable\u2019s IDRIS SHEHU met him at his hotel in Ikoyi, Lagos, it was stunning to see such a prodigiously fierce fighter turn into a cool-headed young man, who, with jokes and stabs of pidgin English, discussed his upbringing, discovering wrestling, transitioning to mixed martial art and the corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects he plans to effect in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver two decades and a half outside Nigeria, yet you haven\u2019t lost touch with your Nigerian side, what kept you connected?\n\nWhen you have a Nigerian father like mine, a former major in the army, and my mom, it\u2019s just ingrained in you. So in our house, mainly we speak pidgin unless we have to speak English. Even before I left Nigeria for America, the culture was ingrained in me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you convince your parents about a wrestling career?\n\nWhen you\u2019re from a Nigerian household, there\u2019s only a couple of acceptable fields that you can go into: become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. Those are the only acceptable fields you can get into as a Nigerian. But growing up overseas, I was exposed to a bit more. Of course, I still had to face my studies because \u2018you\u2019ll become a doctor someday\u2018. Then I found sports as an extracurricular activity on top of my studies and started to excel in that. The better you do that, the more your Nigerian parents realise that this can actually be sustainable. \u2018Ha, my son, you can make money playing sports\u2018. Then they finally accepted. It took time but they finally got around to accepting.\n\nHow did you break the news to them?\n\nThey found out I was wrestling on TV. It was on TV. This is the thing that helped me in breaking the news to them and making it more acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow was the transition from wrestling to mixed martial arts?\n\nThe transition from wrestling to mixed martial arts was tough. But at the same time as a mixed martial artist, you have to be able to do wrestling, boxing, kick-boxing, and jujutsu\u2013 all of the above. And wrestling, of all of those, is the hardest to learn. So once you already have that down it makes the rest a little bit easier so it makes that transition a lot faster as opposed to being a boxer and trying to learn wrestling \u2014 that takes a lot longer, it\u2019s going to take a lot more time. But having been from a wrestling background, that journey was a lot shorter.\n\nDo you still feel fear before your fights?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, absolutely. Each time I fight, I still feel that fear; that never leaves you. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s completely natural to a person, it\u2019s something that you train for and mentally prepare for. The fear is there each time but that\u2019s part of having the courage to be able to get in there and still be able to do it.\n\nWith the recent success of Israel Adesanya and Francis Ngannou and yourself, UFC is under Africa\u2019s domination. What will you say has fuelled the superiority?\n\nI think it\u2019s just our resilience and some of the backgrounds and circumstances that we come from. We have that never-die attitude. It is that resilience that we have that aids us when the times get tough in those fights. Where most people will give up and quit, we fight through that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill there ever be a face-off between the Nigerian Nightmare and Israel Adesanya?\n\nFor me, in my perspective, it is a no. Because I always said I would rather have two Nigerians with belts than one Nigerian with two belts. I\u2019m the type that likes to share. So the number of Nigerians I can get into the UFC to hold belts, the better. I don\u2019t want to keep all the belts to myself; I\u2019m not that greedy or selfish.\n\nYou\u2019re the guy to beat at the UFC welterweight division, having knocked out or outwrestled anyone who ever dared to face you. Are there any plans to move up the division for more competition?\n\nYes of course I\u2019ve been kind of dominating my own weight class, and I\u2019ve beaten pretty much almost everyone in the top five. But a lot of people in that situation would ask if it\u2019s time for you to move up from a different division. In most cases, I would move up, but the next division above happens to be the middleweight division where Israel Adesanya has the belt. So as long as Israel has that belt, I have no plans to move up. But if something happened and Israel was not in the picture, then of course I\u2019ll move up and take the belt.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your CSR project, what issues will the initiative be tackling? Will it be a foundation that focuses on building the next combat sports stars in Nigeria or some other humanitarian issue?\n\nFor me, part of my outreach and some of the things that I want is that I want it to be all of the above. I want to be able to give someone the opportunity to eventually follow those footsteps and say, \u2018hey I want to be like this guy and follow his footsteps and be a champion someday.\u2019 And, at the same time, we want to be able to help who we can along the way.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion about the depth of talents that Nigeria can mine for more success in mixed martial arts?\n\nNigeria has talent. We are very athletic and resilient in a way, but as far as skill-wise, that is something that we have to learn. The sport is not that big yet and not everyone knows it or understands the skills needed. It\u2019s something that we have to clear, but, of course, the talent is here.\n\nPhoto credit: Kamaru Usman/Instagram",

          "text": "TeamApt has become a leader in Nigeria\u2019s agent banking business and that could drive it to the envied status of a billion-dollar startup in the coming months.\n\nHeadquartered in Lagos Nigeria, the company started off in 2015 building applications for banks. By the end of 2018, it processed an average of $160 million transactions per month by supporting the operations of 26 banks.\n\nA year later, it launched Moniepoint, a platform for agent banking.\n\nAs one of the \u201cSuper Agents\u201d licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, TeamApt\u2019s Moniepoint powers thousands of shops where typical banking transactions \u2013 deposits, withdrawals, account opening and more \u2013 are now performed in Nigeria using point-of-sale devices.\n\nBut facing competition from other players, how well is Moniepoint performing?\n\nLeading the pack\n\nTosin Eniolorunda, TeamApt\u2019s founder and CEO, is confident that it is the industry\u2019s number one.\n\nHis audacity is based on data from SANEF, the body empowered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria. According to this data, TeamApt accounts for 74% of the agent banking industry based on the volume of transactions processed monthly.\n\nSANEF\u2019s agent banking data is not public. It is sent confidentially to startups in the sector. TechCabal has not independently verified ranks of performance among these companies.\n\nEniolorunda points to the company\u2019s transaction value numbers as another measure of TeamApt\u2019s maturity in the fintech sector \u2013 and future valuation.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time, according to the CEO. The value for May was \u20a61.4 trillion ($3.5 bn) from a base of 68 million transactions. Total value of transactions TeamApt has processed between April 2020 and April 2021 is $16 bn.\n\nTeamApt says it processed $3.5bn in May 2021, thanks to its leading share of Nigeria\u2019s agent banking sector\n\nThese transactions are from four use cases: deposit, withdrawal, as well as airtime and bill payments. Moniepoint, the company says, has 14 million unique customers monthly.\n\nUnicorn calling?\n\nEniolorunda does not specify what the company\u2019s present valuation is. But based on the above numbers and those of other Nigerian fintechs, he believes TeamApt seats comfortably among the continent\u2019s most valued startups.\n\n\u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal earlier in May.\n\nIn March, Flutterwave said it had processed over 140m transactions worth over $9bn since its founding.\n\nAvailable numbers for Opay are from 2020; the Opera-backed company claimed to have processed $1.4 bn in October and $2bn in December of that year. Paga, on the other hand, processed $2.3 billion in 2020 and $8 billion over the last four years according to CEO Tayo Oviosu.\n\nBig Milestone for Paga @mypaga & Digital Acceleration\n\n\n\nWe crossed 3 Trillion Naira in transaction values processed since the start of commercial operations in 2012.\n\n\n\nHit N2 Trillion in March 2020\n\n\n\nHit N3 Trillion in May 2021\n\n\n\n15 months to process 1 Trillion!\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 #JustPagait \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) June 7, 2021\n\nNot much is known about Firstmonie, also in the agent banking heavyweight category. Observers say it is more private due to its ownership by First Bank.\n\nUnless TeamApt is acquired for a billion dollars or goes public, the only available way to estimate its valuation will come after a funding round.\n\nRumors of an announcement circulated briefly in May but the company has yet to officially declare a round. Its last fundraise was $5.5m Series A in February 2019, led by Jim Ovia\u2019s Quantum Capital.\n\nAt a media event this week Thursday, Eniolorunda confirmed the round \u2013 \u201ca couple of tens of million\u201d \u2013 has been closed. Another \u2013 \u201ca lot more\u201d \u2013 is in progress.\n\nWhen these are announced, a clearer picture will emerge of the company\u2019s valuation, direction and, more broadly, investor appetite for high-growing fintech companies in Africa.\n\nFlutterwave and Chipper Cash have made headlines in the first half of the year with $100-million-plus rounds that catapulted them to unicorn status. OPay is reported to have a $400 million deal in the works which could value it at $1.5bn, and Paga expects to be a unicorn in a year or two.\n\nIs TeamApt next in line?\n\nDigital bank on the horizon\n\nMeanwhile, the company is evolving to a more consumer-facing company.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we are directing our business towards becoming a digital bank,\u201d Enioolorunda says.\n\nIn this new direction, Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking but will also be used as an app by individuals as a digital bank. Eniolorunda says this \u201chybrid approach\u201d is essential to truly serve underserved people in Africa who, for good reason, retain a need to physically visit service providers when quality falls short.\n\nThe other expansion on the company\u2019s playbook is geographical; TeamApt plans to start operating in the \u201cthird-largest francophone country\u201d in Africa by the third quarter of the year, the CEO says.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Five Nigerian banks have signed up as pioneer members of a new initiative that aims to increase partnerships between corporations and startups in emerging markets.\n\nThe initiative is called the Circle of Corporate Investors and is organised by Catalyst Fund, an accelerator operating in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe aim is to help startups and corporates \u201cbetter discover technical and commercial synergies while sharing learnings and insights with the wider industry,\u201d says Maelis Carraro, Catalyst Fund\u2019s managing director.\n\nThe banks joining the partnership are Access, Sterling, Ecobank, and Fidelity. VFD Group, an investment company that owns VBank, a digital bank, has also signed up.\n\nThe startup-corporates face-off\n\nAdvances in digital technology have limited the barrier to service delivery in sectors like financial services. As mobile phones replace office buildings as access points, competition has increased between slow-moving old corporations and agile up-starts.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, the likes of Paystack and Flutterwave have taken command of online payments, enough to make respected institutions like Guaranty Trust Bank set up new structures to counter the threat.\n\nBut emerging market narratives of disruption that pit startups and corporates against each other gloss over many avenues of collaboration that currently lie fallow.\n\nFor all that is impressive about the current state of tech progress, the reality is that traditional corporates retain a stronger hold of offline markets and cover wider geographies than startups.\n\nOne example is Access bank. Founded in 1988, it has risen through managerial adjustments and corporate acquisitions to become Nigeria\u2019s largest bank.\n\nAccess has 36 million customers across 600 service locations in 12 countries on three continents. Somewhere in there is a trove of market resources that will be invaluable for startups that enter into strategic partnerships with the bank. Landing such a partner can signal a startup\u2019s ambition to competitors and legitimacy to customers.\n\nCorporates could benefit from startups\u2019 agility, innovation and flexibility to increase value to customers and speed up digital innovation, Carrro said.\n\nWhile their history and coverage are impressive, traditional banks were slow in pushing Nigeria past a 3% credit penetration mark until digital lenders came on board with avant-garde instant loans.\n\nBut partnerships are risky, yes?\n\n\u2018Leverage my market and network, while I leverage your tech and agility\u2019 should create a win-win for both sides. However, such business partnerships are not straightforward.\n\nA 2019 Harvard Business Review article explained that \u201cdisparities in size, structure and power\u201d can make it difficult for startups to connect with the right nodes within a large corporation. These disparities throw up risks for both parties.\n\nA startup may spend too much time building a custom solution for one large corporate partner, thereby failing to think of itself as a platform that can scale universally. Also, the corporate partner, distracted by other interests, may not devote the requisite high-level manpower to make the best of this partnership.\n\nThere are risks for corporates too. Startups are experiments and could come with reputational risks for corporates when they fail or splinter into some sort of scandal. As this World Economic Forum whitepaper notes, \u201cmany start-ups fail, so the investment risk for corporates is high compared to their usual investment projects.\u201d\n\nFrom the above, it becomes clear that for startup-corporate partnerships to succeed, some work needs to be done to mitigate the risks involved. It is possible that startups and corporates can, on their own, set up the right structures and interfaces to reduce such risks.\n\nBut what if a middleman does the work?\n\nDe-risking partnerships\n\nWith its Circle of Corporate Investors, Catalyst Fund hopes to be a partnerships accelerator by providing an ecosystem of tools that de-risk partnerships.\n\nIn its best form, such an accelerator should add precision to how corporates source, assess, and implement new innovations for their customers. Though its first members are banks, the initiative has plans to include telcos, FMCGs and logistics providers.\n\nThe perks of membership for corporates includes access to Catalyst Fund\u2019s portfolio of 40+ active startups in three regions. In Africa, that portfolio includes Chipper Cash, Cowrywise, Sokowatch and 27 other startups.\n\nCatalyst Fund is also promising \u2018custom toolkits\u2019 that will strengthen and streamline partnership processes. It plans to facilitate \u201cknowledge sharing roundtables\u201d with global corporate innovators.\n\nUntil now, Catalyst Fund\u2019s main focus has been to offer venture building support \u2013 product design, marketing strategy, and more to startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this experiment will fare. They point to helping Unilever reach millions of new consumers through Sokowatch as one instance of what they can help achieve.\n\nEither way, the Nigerian banks that have signed up think it will be a worthwhile adventure.\n\nNvalaye Kourouma, Chief Digital Officer at Ecobank, describes the initiative as \u201ca major step in building a framework for a productive engagement with startups and other key stakeholders to make this a success.\u201d\n\nFor VFD Group, it provides an opportunity to accelerate their vision of reaching the last mile with practical and empowering solutions, according to Gbenga Omolokun, the company\u2019s Executive Director for Group Risk, Compliance and Technology.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

The regulator adds that it is constantly looking for ways to accommodate innovation without \u2018compromising market integrity and stay within limits that ensure investor protection.\u2019\n\nOnce the program kicks off in Q3 2021, financial businesses running on full or auxiliary technology in the country will have to fill a Fintech Initial Assessment (FIA) form to determine if they are excluded from the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the situation where the said innovation doesn\u2019t have an existing regulatory framework, the startup will proceed to apply for the RI program.\n\nBased on SEC\u2019s terms, the application will either be accepted or rejected on the basis of whether the innovation is allowed or not.\n\nTen months into the incubation program, the startup will be presented with guidelines covering its services. This is to help it gain clarity on the appropriate regulatory regime applicable to it.\n\nOn completion of the 12-month program, the startup is either directed to continue operating as a registered entity or terminate its operations.\n\nIt can only be imagined how far reaching the effect of this intended move will have on fintech startups as a number of innovations in the country\u2019s fintech sector are still trying to find a fit within the existing regulations governing the financial sector.\n\nA possible implication is that API fintech startups, micro-lending platforms, investment tech, and other innovations operating under no specific regulatory framework may have to cease operation until certified through the incubation program.\n\nAlready, there are existing CBN guidelines covering mobile money operators, e-payment channels, USSD services, international money transfer, remittance and similar services. As it were, crowdfunding startups barely escaped this new directive as a framework was recently enforced in May.\n\nCrypto and digital commodity investment startups, on the other hand, may not make it through the FIA stage since their services are still restricted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this can be explained as another case of regulations chasing after innovation. Still, it is unclear when regulations begin to stifle innovation, even as fintechs have been helping boost financial inclusion on the continent.\n\nIt is also not clear how this incubation program is different from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s regulatory sandbox \u2014 a platform that allows fintech companies to test their products and get regulatory approval before launching.\n\nA major drawback to the CBN\u2019s sandbox could be a distrust for regulators among most startup founders.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s incubation program, however, has the added incentive of legitimacy, but the Commission has not revealed how it plans to enforce it.",

With the relaunch of the talent platform, the startup can connect more talents with jobs.\n\nAfter creating a profile on the platform, businesses can access a diverse pool of talents in software development, graphic design, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, product development, and digital marketing, which are available for remote or on-site work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese talents are pre-vetted by Gebeya, and the company ensures that businesses get the best fit for their tasks. Gebeya\u2019s matching algorithm considers location, language, and budget when matching businesses with talents.\n\nThis way, businesses of all sizes can access the services they need without being restricted by their budget or location. Companies can also hire a core team if they like.\n\nWhile most people would argue that there is a shortage of technical talent in Africa, Amadou Daffe, CEO and Co-founder of Gebeya, seems to disagree.\n\n\u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t have a talent deficiency, it has a matching problem, and that is what Gebeya is seeking to address through the deployment of a true Pan-African marketplace.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by freelance marketplace, Upwork, 59 million Americans performed freelance work and contributed $1.2 trillion to the American economy. Contrastingly, there is no reliable data on the number of freelance workers in Africa or their contribution to the economy.\n\nGebeya plans to help more businesses hire more freelancers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for businesses to leverage the sharp skills and fresh perspective that freelancers infuse into a permanent workforce,\u201d Daffe added.\n\nSeveral startups have sprung up in Africa to meet the continent\u2019s demand for talent, with Andela, Decagon, and Gebeya leading the charge. Their involvement is all the more critical given projections that Africa\u2019s youth population will cross the one billion mark by 2050 and governments and schools failing to provide them with the skills or jobs they need.\n\nAdvertisement",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenya-based foodtech startup, has announced raising $1 million in pre-seed funding. This raise was led by pan-African early-stage VC, Launch Africa Ventures. Consonance Investments, Liechtenstein-based investment company, Century Oak Capital GmbH, and Pariti, an ecosystem management firm also invested in this round.\n\nFounded in December 2020 by France-born Robin Reecht, Kune\u2019s objective is to provide ready-to-eat food services at a moderate price.\n\nReecht revealed, per TechCrunch, that when he moved to Kenya in 2020, he found it difficult to get affordable and well-cooked food anywhere other than Uber Eats, Jumia, or Glovo with foods that go for $10. The alternative \u2014 cheap roadside food \u2014 didn\u2019t taste as good.\n\nHe took it upon himself to proffer a sustainable solution to bridge the gap between great food and affordable pricing. The following month, he started Kune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReecht tested for product/market fit by creating a trial in a week, from which he got 50 excited customers who had probably been waiting for such a solution. After the trial, his customer base grew to 150 people, and the startup sold over 500 meals.\n\nFood prices cost as little as $4, and Kune raised $50,000 from customers to sustain operations.\n\nBusiness was so good that the startup\u2019s small team struggled to meet their orders. Consequently, the quality of service dropped, and the company decided to retreat and take a break.\n\nIt turned out to be a time to rethink their strategy, as Kune resumed operations with more hires. The company began building a factory with the capacity to cook and package 5,000 meals daily. Kune was ready to raise, and investors took notice.\n\nTwo months later, with a million-dollar check in hand, Kune is one of the first non-fintech startups in the African tech ecosystem to raise a seven-figure pre-seed.\n\nThis funding will be used to internalise all production and human resources capacities, including hiring more team members, completing the factory building, and launching officially in August.\n\nLaunch Africa\u2019s Director of Operation, Baljinder Sharma, believes that having complete autonomy over their supply chain will provide massive growth and scaling opportunity for the startup; hence plans include owning a fleet of 100 electric motorcycles and hiring 100 female riders by 2022.\n\nReetch also revealed plans to create a food media company where Kenyans will be kept up-to-speed with the global food scene and export African foods to Europe and the US by creating weight-reduction, retail, and microwaveable meal offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe aim is to be the go-to for quality, freshly-made and affordable ready-to-eat meal delivery service and be a number one culinary major. With Kune anticipating a fast growth rate, we just might have more founders looking into Africa\u2019s foodtech space.",

          "text": "The Nigerian media industry has called on the House of Representatives to step down a bill seeking to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, saying it is still a subject of litigation at the Supreme Court.\n\nThis message was given by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO), which covers the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), and the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), at the House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values organised public hearing on the bill. The House, however, insisted on going ahead with the exercise.\n\nIn recent time, several media organisations and groups have criticised various clauses in the bill as possibly discouraging Freedom of Speech in the country.\n\nThe committee had organised the hearing on five bills that include the \u2018Bill for an Act to Amend the Nigerian Press Council Act, CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, to Remove Bottlenecks Affecting Its Performance and Make the Council in Tune with Current Realities in Regulating the Press and for Related Matters (HB 330).\u2019\n\nOlusegun Odebunmi, chairman of the committee, apologised to the Nigerian media, especially NPAN that protested on Wednesday over exclusion from the exercise, saying an open invitation to the event was extended to all stakeholders.\n\nOdebunmi said, \u201cSo, I am sorry if there is anybody who thinks we did not invite them. It is not by intention; it was definitely a mistake. Notwithstanding, we have covered everybody through our advert.\u201d\n\nHowever, Azubuike Ishiekwene, editor-in-chief of Leadership Newspapers, who represented the NPO, said contrary to the claim of an open invitation by the committee, the organisation did not receive any notification that would have enabled it engage the lawmakers and Nigerians robustly on the bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a matter and I am sure that as stewards of the people and the law, you are aware that there is a pending matter between the NPO and some parties involved in this legislation. That is why a negotiated conversation seems to us to be a way to deal with it because there is a matter pending before the Supreme Court: between the NPAN and some parties involved in this bill that is being amended. And as stewards of the law, I am sure you are constrained just as I am to make any further conversations on this matter because it is a pending matter before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThe last time it came up in 2010 \u2013 it is a matter that has actually been pending since 1999 \u2013 17 of the 39 clauses contained in the bill that you are considering were ruled unconstitutional by the court at that time. Of course, the Federal Government appealed the ruling. We won the appeal and the matter is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI will rest my case by appealing to the honourable members of this committee; I crave your indulgence to refer to a conversation that was had on a similar matter in 2018 when this matter came up before the Senate and the pendency of this matter before the court was canvassed. And the Senate \u2013 the 8th National Assembly \u2013 at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step,\u201d Ishiekwene stated.\n\nOn his part, Odebunmi argued that the House was doing its constitutional job \u201cand I am very sure (that) no court will restrain us from doing the job,\u201d saying while the lawmakers would not stop anybody from going ahead with the judicial process, the lawmakers had the mandate of Nigerians to amend laws.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is not about the matter in court, it is an Act of the National Assembly and we deemed it fit to amend it and we are doing that. It does not stop you from what you are doing but this is the position of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nIn a memo was signed by Lanre Arogundade, executive director, IPC; Edetaen Ojo, executive director, MRA; Richard Akinnola, executive director, CMLA, and Dapo Olorunyomi, executive director, PTCIJ, the International Press Centre, Media Rights Agenda, Centre for Media Law and Advocacy and the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, a joint memorandum titled \u2018For a Truly Independent and Media Freedom Friendly Nigeria Press Council,\u2019 called on the National Assembly to expunge all laws intended to criminalise free speech and press.\n\nArogundade, who read from the memo, said, \u201cFirst, we like to say that the international behaviour towards media regulation is peer regulation, constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press, and the expunging from statute all laws that criminalises freedom of expression. This is the line the Committee should tow like Ghana has done and like South Africa has done; and with regards to throwing off defamation statute from the books, the way Sierra Leone has done.\n\n\u201cA consideration is that the amendment seeks an unabashed focus to restrict freedom of expression while masking the toga of something else. It attempts to do what other laws have done like the Cybercrimes Acts which Sections 24 and 38, which in no fewer than ten instances have been used to clampdown on bloggers or journalists for expressing opinion antagonistic to politically or economically powerful elites.\n\n\u201cBodies like the Amnesty International has documented 50 cases where the law had targeted, not cybercrime suspects, but bloggers and journalists for writing on what they \u2018know to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another.\u2019\u201d\n\nOthers are that, \u201cThe ethical code that should be operationalised by the council is the Code of Ethics of Journalists in Nigeria as adopted by the Nigerian Press Organisation, comprising the Nigeria Union of Journalists, the Nigerian Guild of Editors and the Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria in Ilorin in 1998 and as may be regularly updated. This has been the practice. A political and non-journalism office like that of the Minister of Information should not be given the power of approval over the code of conduct of journalists.\n\n\u201cThe power to determine sanctions relating to hefty fines should be vested in the courts and not the council. The Court of Appeal has clearly established this legal principle in NOSDRA v Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (2018) LPELR-44210 (CA) where it held that \u2018the imposition of fines by NOSDRA was contrary to its powers on the basis that penalties or fines are imposed as punishment for an offence or violation of the law and the power as well as competence to establish that an offence has been committed belongs to the courts and not a regulatory agency.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe provision relating to revocation of license for alleged publication of fake news should be removed from the Act. Decisions for appropriate sanctions in relation to such offences should be vested in the law courts.\u201d",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain ongoing infrastructure projects across the state to boost economic activities and improve the lives of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are aware and know that the road has been awarded by NDDC.

We will do something quick for our people at Urhonigbe because we know that our people are predominantly farmers.\n\n\u201cWe would deploy officials from the Ministry of Infrastructure to examine the state of the road to enable us to provide palliative measures before providing a permanent solution to the road. As an administration, we will do our best to ensure that the people of the community feel the impact of the government.\u201d\n\nAppreciating the people of Ugha Quarters for the support before, during and after the governorship election in the state, the governor noted: \u201cI appreciate you for your support and prayers before, during and after the election, as well as your support throughout the time in the courts.\n\n\u201cThe last election proved to us that you trust this administration and I want to assure you that the confidence reposed in us will not be betrayed. We will deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of the State, including Ugha Quarters in Urhonigbe.\n\n\u201cAs a candidate, I visited the 192 wards of Edo State and know what the people want; I am prepared to ensure that we improve the standard of living of our people.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Odiowere of Ugha Quarters, Michael Evharevba, whose speech was read by the Secretary, Michael Omorotionmwan, congratulated the governor and his deputy on their victory in the September 2020 governorship election and the subsequent successes at the courts.\n\n...",

          "title": "Spotlighting Femi Fani-Kayode, Nigeria\u2019s anti-vaccination champion who later took the jab",
          "text": "On March 30, a former Nigerian minister announced on Twitter that he had taken the COVID-19 vaccine. Strange news! For over a year since the virus was first detected in Nigeria, his name, Femi Fani-Kayode, rang a deterrent bell of anti-vaccination.\n\nApart from his many political jabs against the ruling party, fraud allegations and their resultant court cases, Mr Fani-Kayode had before that date, played a leading role in the league of COVID-19 vaccination opposers and confronters.\n\nAt one time, he described the vaccine as a ploy to create a new world order, at another he tagged vaccination an exercise that would result in the deaths of millions. To further dissuade his followers, he would tweet unconfirmed information and conspiracy theories being peddled against the virus.\n\nA regular reference for journalists, Mr Fani-Kayode was once described by a fact-checker as one who makes \u201cbogus statements, capitalising on his large social media followership to spur the spread of disinformation and misinformation.\u201d\n\nAll reports on his conversion (those encountered in the course of research for this report) made references to his earlier comments on the virus but none made pragmatic efforts in measuring the former minister\u2019s previous disparaging comments on his followers.\n\nOn Twitter, the announcement was greeted with mixed reactions. To some, it was only a matter of time, they knew all along he would be vaccinated for travel access. To others, mostly those who refused to be converted alongside him, another soldier in the fight against vaccination had deserted. A few questioned his advertent mislead of many followers.\n\nThe numbers before conversion\n\nOne of the first notable, misleading COVID-19-related tweets by Mr Fani-Kayode was on March 29, 2020, when he claimed that the virus was a ploy to create a new world order and get the United States President, Donald Trump, out of power. Elections in the U.S. were about seven months away then.\n\n\u201cOne of the many objectives of the Illuminati & those that are behind the coronavirus pandemic & the emergence of a New World Order is to get @realDonaldTrump out of power in this year\u2019s pres. election by sparking off a massive recession & crashing the American &world economy,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe tweet as of Monday, June 14, had garnered 6,904 retweets, likes and comments and thousands of duplication across many platforms. Some fact-checking efforts were deployed to counter these claims but not long enough, Mr Fani-Kayode released two more fearsome tweets about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nOn April 30, he warned Nigerians not to take vaccines which by then were in the trial stages. In doing so, he made three unfounded, totally false claims. Firstly, that vaccination would result in millions of deaths; secondly, that Nigeria was about to enact a law to make vaccination compulsory for all, and thirdly, that the vaccines are meant to depopulate the world.\n\nThe first of these three claims conform with the popular misconstrued comment of Robert Young, an alternative medicine practitioner, who at a meeting of a conspiracy theory group said that vaccination is a chemical warfare to depopulate the world. The video was widely shared by many but a fact-check revealed that the comment was made earlier in 2019, before the detection of COVID-19, in respect of the different vaccines given to children in the first six years. Despite the fact-checking efforts, Mr Fani-kayode still shared the video in January 2021.\n\nTwo days later, on May 2, Mr Fani-Kayode tweeted again, \u201c@WHO are set to begin Covid 19 vaccine trials in our country. EVIL! Not only have our people been turned into Guinea pigs to test Gates\u2019 killer vaccine but our leaders are also passing a law which will make the use of that evil vaccine compulsory. What a mess! I weep for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSome of his tweets may, at this period (with multiple vaccine roll out in many countries) come as laughing items, but they were sacred voices of caution when they were made. They were tweeted when a large part of Nigeria was on lockdown enforced to curtail the effect of the virus.\n\nThe lockdown notwithstanding, over 200 people, including Abba Kyari, the then Chief of Staff to the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, had died of the virus; confirmed cases were in total of thousands; patients were treated in isolation centres with close monitoring; worse still, researches on the virus had not reached advanced stages, hence, conspiracy theories held sway. In short, it was a time of panic and tweets by Mr Fani-Kayode readily reinforced people\u2019s fears and biases.\n\nHow then did a panic monger convert?\n\nThe conversion and the dangers inherent in peddling falsehood\n\nAgainst the nature of his comments, Mr Fani-Kayode announced on March 30, 2021, that he had taken a jab. \u201cDespite my initially strong reservations I bowed to sound logic and superior reasoning and took my Covid 19 vaccine today,\u201d he wrote in a thread of tweets.\n\nHe went further to explain the \u2018sound logic\u2019 and \u2018superior reasoning\u2019 to include persuasions from his political associates and the fact that his hero, Donald Trump, had taken it, despite his initial opposing stance.\n\nAs of the morning of Monday, June 14, his announcement tweets had a total of 1,173 likes, comments and retweets; a less than 10 per cent faction of interaction when compared to four of his falsehood spreading tweets examined in this piece.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis confirms the concerns of some researchers who have discovered that a good percentage of people who come in contact with false information don\u2019t care about the follow-up fact-checks. A recent survey by Zignal labs showed that 86 per cent of Americans who read news articles on social media do not always fact-check.\n\nNot done, the ex-minister still used the opportunity of his vaccination to peddle falsehood about vaccines.\n\nHe wrote in the thread, \u201cThe Covid vaccines we are taking in Nigeria are not Bill Gates\u2019 vaccines and neither are we being used as Guinea pigs. These ones are tried & tested, have already been approved & have been administered successfully throughout the world. This is the Oxford Azrazeneca brand.\n\n\u201cThere is a world of difference between what we are being given in Nigeria & the exploratory vaccines that @WHO had wanted to test Africans with which we spoke against & resisted last year. Most importantly Bill Gates& his foundation have no connection with Oxford Azrazeneca.\n\n\u201cI would not touch anything Bill Gates with a barge pole for obvious reasons. Mark it.\u201d\n\nOne notices that he recounted some of his earlier misinformation about the vaccines but not all that came in contact with the falsehood are impressed.\n\nOne of his followers replied sarcastically; \u201cI praise your patriotism for agreeing to be one of our guinea pigs. Well done.\u201d Another wrote; \u201cnonsense\u201d with rolling eyes emoji.\n\nPerhaps this reply captures the question you might readily want to ask; \u201cYou got convinced by your sister and friend. What about the thousands you convinced and made to see the vaccine as devil products?\u201d\n\nThis publication was produced as part of IWPR\u2019s Africa Resilience Network (ARN) programme, administered in partnership with the Centre for Information Resilience(CIR), the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) and Africa Uncensored.",

This requires a complementary approach where imported food is crucial to ensure food security while also supporting the government\u2019s long-term agricultural transformation plan to build a sustainable dairy sector in Nigeria. Our new dairy farm is our next step in our commitment to Nigeria,\u201d says Managing Director of Nigeria Peder Pedersen.\n\nArla Foods farm management expert, Snorri Sigurdsson says, \u201cI am very proud of our collaborations to support the sustainable development of the Nigerian dairy sector and excited about what our new state-of-the-art farm will achieve. To collaborate with farmers in many parts of world, sharing knowledge and supporting local dairy industries is a key part of our cooperative mindset and our farm in Nigeria is the next important step. When it is built, we can support local dairy farmers to create better livelihoods and it is a key enabler to growing dairy and food production on a local scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisements",

I say independent because it is a stand-alone and we were registered in 2012. We are happy today to announce that after over 15 months of the NCAA reviewing our variation and our operational specifications (OpsSpecs) and also expanding our capability list in wheels and breaks, we have finally finished our phase five which is the last stage in the certification process and we have been granted final approval,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe huge capital in aircraft maintenance we often experience, amounting to over $1billion that is annually spent in West Africa alone is going to help create jobs here in Nigeria, he said.\n\nHe further noted that as former president of the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), he had seen the difficulties and foreign exchange airline operators spent to fly their airplanes overseas for repairs, incurring huge costs to operators and the industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cwe have done inspection and maintenance on Augusta 139 helicopters which most VIPs, even the presidency and most oil and gas companies (Mobil, Shell, and Chevron) operate.

I can tell you categorically that aside from about 10 expatriates that we have to transfer technology to indigenous engineers and train them on some few areas that we are not yet strong at, we already have about 68 local engineers that have the manufacturers\u2019 type-course on those aircraft.\u201d\n\nDisclosing that the business is capital intensive, he added that, \u201cwe have invested over $5 million on equipment alone. These are equipment that the NCAA team came to inspect and they are satisfied and the equipment are all overhauled, calibrated, and up-to-date, and our engineers are well-trained on how to operate the equipment.

In my opinion, a power shift is necessary for all Nigerians to have a sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nShekarau, however, noted that although the rotational presidency was not written in the APC\u2019s constitution, he believed it was desirable for justice and fairness.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari in Borno, tasks security agencies on terrorism\u2026\n\nHe said, \u201cFor instance, the present six geopolitical zones are not reflected in Nigeria\u2019s constitution, but it is a good arrangement. You cannot implement any policy in Nigeria without considering geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cYou see, the North alone cannot produce enough votes for the president. Likewise the South; it is only when we come together. My belief is not only geopolitical regions, no state in the federation does not have a competent person to lead this country.\n\n\u201cI think that we should exercise patience and bring our brothers from the South close to us.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker while speaking on the possibility of the Peoples Democratic Party fielding a northern candidate, said both the PDP and APC faced the same dilemma.\n\n\u201cEach is trying to outsmart the other. My advice to the parties (APC and PDP) is that they should not look at zoning from political exploitation, but what should be just and fair. Fair play and competence of the candidate should be the guiding principle,\u201d he added.\n\nHe emphasised the need for the ruling party to elect party officials from the ward to national levels in addition to setting up a modality on how to spread political appointments across the country.",

          "title": "You contributed to current upheavals: Femi Adesina attacks Obasanjo",
          "text": "Michael Adeshina\n\nFemi Adesina has identified former President Olusegun Obasanjo as one of the persons who contributed to the current upheavals in Nigeria.\n\nAdesina stated this in his weekly article titled \u201cNIGERIA\u2019S UNITY AND ALL THE IBERIBERISM.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians speaking about Nigeria\u2019s unity and the possibility of disintegration are now at the point of Iberiberism \u2013 a word he defined as political foolery and trickery or stupidity.\n\nHe, however, added that Obasanjo contributed to the current political foolishness in Nigeria through his actions and inactions.\n\nHe also warned the former president to mind his thoughts and language.\n\nThe presidential aide also knocked activists, others who contributed to the Democracy Day Protest on June 12.\n\nPlease read Femi Adesina\u2019s article titled NIGERIA\u2019S UNITY AND ALL THE IBERIBERISM below\n\nWhich one is Iberiberism again o? What kind of English shall we not hear in this country?\n\nWell, the word is not regular English language, neither is it my creation. The copyright belongs to former Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha, who created something being fast accepted in English from the Igbo word, Iberibe, meaning foolery, trickery, or stupidity. It is the act of being deceitful or untrue.\n\nOkorocha engaged in neologism when he created the word Iberiberism, and used it to describe political foolery and trickery or stupidity.\n\nLet\u2019s divert a bit. There was another Imo man, who was a master neologist. His name was Chief Ozuomba Mbadiwe, man of timber and caliber, pillar and caterpillar, the political juggernaut. He would tell us that \u201ccome would soon come to become,\u201d and other such ticklish expressions.\n\nI once interviewed Chief Greg Iheanacho Mbadiwe, who regaled me with his father\u2019s ability to create words. He said as a boy, he was struggling with another young boy in his father\u2019s compound, not knowing that the father was watching with keen interest from upstairs.\n\nWhen the tussle became too long, Chief Ozuomba Mbadiwe bellowed: \u201cIheanachooooo. Will you slap that boy, and let him be seconsaimabalism.\u201d\n\nHoly Moses! What does the word mean? You will search all the dictionaries in the world, including the ones that have not been compiled, and you will never find the word seconsaimabalism. It\u2019s a creation of Chief Mbadiwe, just as Okorocha created Iberiberism.\n\nNow, back to the main issue. The sabre-rattling about Nigeria\u2019s unity and the possibility of disintegration has got to the point of Iberiberism.\n\nSome people have no other business than doomsday predictions of a crumbled, collapsed Nigeria, as if they actually fast and pray for that eventuality.\n\nWhen Chief Olusegun Obasanjo was President between 1999 and 2007, they predicted that he was going to be the last President of a united Nigeria. It didn\u2019t happen. When Umaru Yar\u2019Adua came, they said he was too sick to hold Nigeria together. The country stood. Under Goodluck Jonathan, they said the man was too weak, and different components of the country would soon say, \u2018to your tents oh Israel.\u2019 Nigeria survived. And for six years under Muhammadu Buhari, they have not changed their songs. The Somaliasation of Nigeria was on the way. The Fulanisation of the country would be the final death knell. But Nigeria lives. It trudges on from day to day, month to month, and will surely survive.\n\nVeno Marioghae (by the way, where is she?) got it right in her hit song of the 1980s, when she said:\n\nIf them thief our oil o\n\nEven if them burn the oil o\n\n(Nigeria go survive)\n\nI say if them drink the oil o\n\nNo matter how them try o\n\n(Nigeria go survive)\n\nOur roots them strong for ground o\n\nAncestors no go gree ooo (Nigeria go survive)\n\nThe god of thunder and lightning\n\nUnited shield Nigeria\n\n(Nigeria go survive)\n\nNigeria go survive\n\nAfrica go survive\n\nMy people go survive o\n\nNigeria go survive.\n\nYes, sing it from Abeokuta to Kaura Namoda, from Isokoland to Brass, from Orlu to Nsukka, Nigeria will survive. To, therefore, continue to wail about disintegration is now bordering on Iberiberism. We need to change our tongue, and our song. Nigeria go survive.\n\nWhy do some people always dwell on the negative? They have been seeing nothing but negative for decades, but Nigeria remains sturdy and steady. Yes, countries do fail, collapse, crumble, but Nigeria will survive. Let them change from malediction to benediction. It will be well with this country.\n\nSome fathers of the land will not fold their hands and see Nigeria go down. Fortunately, we have one of them as President now. The young Muhammadu Buhari spent 30 months in the frontlines as a young army officer, fighting the war of unity. And he has said it: we will not be around and watch Nigeria go down. Never. We will rather speak to insurrectionists in the language they understand.\n\nAnd what of Olusegun Obasanjo, a civil war hero. Despite all that he has contributed to the current upheavals by his actions and inactions, words and bile, he says it is idiotic to wish Nigeria disintegration now. Good. But let us put our money where our mouth is. Let Baba mind his thoughts and his language.\n\nLast Saturday, as Nigeria celebrated Democracy Day, some people wanted to stoke protests, riots and destruction. Did the system allow it? Not at all. Should it have been allowed? Not when there is still law and order in the land. Only anarchists would set the country on fire in the name of Democracy Day protests. And it was sad, tragic, to hear some so-called activists asking the police to apologize to Nigerians, for not folding their arms, and allowing the country to go into a tailspin. Anarchists masquerading as activists. And they would be the first to show a clean pair of heels when things go awry, leaving innocent people to suffer. Kudos to our law enforcement agents for being professional. It\u2019s the way to go.\n\nThere cannot be development without peace. Nigeria, despite severe security challenges, is taking giant strides in development, particularly infrastructure. President Buhari was in Lagos last week to commission Lagos-Ibadan rail project, a maritime security project, Deep Blue, costing millions of dollars, and to handover massive security equipment to the Nigeria Police. This week, he has been in Maiduguri, Borno State, to also commission landmark projects. Nigeria is making progress, despite all the odds.\n\nNext year, the last full year of the current administration in power, the country, by the grace of God, will witness the commissioning of legacy projects. Roads, bridges, gas projects, many others. Why then would anybody wish the country death? That would be Iberiberism at its height, and such people should stop it. They should begin to speak peace, rather than discord, they should begin to speak the language of God, rather than that of the accuser of the brethren. Nigeria will survive.\n\nSome weeks back, when I wrote that Nigeria was like the testicles of a ram, which only sways from side to side as the animal runs, and would never fall off, some idle hateful hearts deliberately attempted to turn what I said upside down, and were \u2018dragging\u2019 themselves on the now rusticated Twitter. One simply ignored them. And to show that I stand by what I wrote, I repeat it again: \u201cThis country is like the testicles of a ram, which gyrates from side to side, as the animal runs. However fast the speed of the ram, have you ever seen the testicles fall off? Or when a woman runs, and holds her breasts, is it for fear that those tender parts will fall off? It never happens.\u201d\n\nNigeria will survive. The polity will endure. And the component parts will live together in amity and brotherhood. Any other option is Iberiberism.",

          "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\n\nNigeria\u2019s former President, Olusegun Obasanjo has recounted his last encounter with former Zambian President, Kenneth Kaunda before his death.\n\nKaunda died on Thursday at the age of 97.\n\nObasanjo, in a condolence message to the family of the deceased and Zambia, said he last met with Kaunda in December 2015, when he visited him at his home in Lusaka.\n\n\u201dAs we discussed about everything from family to politics in our two countries and indeed in Africa generally, I asked him if the Africa that we have today is the Africa for which he and his contemporaries struggled and fought.\n\n\u201cPresident Kaunda was visibly pained in his response and at some point he broke down and wept. It was obvious to me how disappointed he was about some of the challenges that have plagued our continent for decades since independence,\u201d he narrated.\n\nObasanjo said in this moment of great loss to Zambians and indeed all Africans, \u201cI wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the Kaunda family, President Edgar Lungu, and the government and people of the Republic of Zambia.\n\n\u201dThe demise of President Kaunda at the grand old age of 97 years brings to end the pioneers and forefathers who led the struggles for decolonisation of the African continent and received the instrument of Independence from the colonial masters in Africa.\u201d\n\nHe urged all Africans and friends of Africa take solace in the knowledge that Kaunda has gone home to a well-deserved rest and to proudly take his place beside his brothers such as Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor of Senegal, Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria, Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 of Guinea, F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Patrice Lumumba of Congo, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, among others.\n\n\u201dAll of them, without exception, were nationalists who made sacrifices in diverse ways. Some, like Patrice Lumumba, untimely lost their lives soon after independence. We are consoled that God granted President Kaunda long life to witness the progression of Africa through five decades of proud and not-so proud moments.\n\n\u201dAs we mourn President Kaunda, my prayer is that the death of this great African son and leader will remind us of the sacrifices that he and his contemporaries who fought for Africa\u2019s independence made.\n\n\u201dLet it remind us of the vision that they had for Africa; their hopes and aspirations; their dream for a free, strong, united and prosperous Africa. Let us, African leaders and people, never let the labour of these heroes past be in vain. Rest well, KK. Africa is free and will be great,\u201d Obasanjo stated.",

          "title": "Insecurity: I Feel Safer In Maiduguri Than Abuja \u2013 Ndume",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSolomon Elusoji, Lagos\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, on Thursday said he is more at ease when visiting Maiduguri than Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMaiduguri, the Borno state capital, is closer to Nigeria\u2019s insurgency war in the North-East.\n\nThe war has raged on for over a decade.\n\nBut Ndume, while speaking on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said the insurgents have been kept away from the city and can only attack soft targets in other areas of Borno State.\n\n\u201cI live in Abuja and also live in Maiduguri,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I come to Maiduguri, I feel safer than in Abuja, because somebody can knock down your door with a gun. In Maiduguri, we don\u2019t hear of that.\n\n\u201cIt is outside Maiduguri where the insurgents are marauding around and attack intermittently. And that\u2019s normal with insurgents, that\u2019s why they are called insurgents, they do hit and run on soft targets.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that \u201cin every society, you can\u2019t wipe out criminality completely. In America, there is school shooting. Our own is that we have known terrorists and the army is fighting them.\u201d\n\nSenator Ndume, who has repeatedly called for more funding for the army, said the situation seems to be improving with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s commitment to the welfare of the fighting troops.\n\n\u201cWith the new budget, things will soon change,\u201d he said.\n\nA turning point\n\nSenator Ndume was speaking on the heels of President Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno earlier on Thursday.\n\nThe Senator described the visit as a boost to the morale of the Nigerian troops.\n\n\u201cThe President went round for six hours \u2013 I was tired. He came in 10 o\u2019clock and we were going to see various projects until four o\u2019clock this evening before he left,\u201d he said, praising President Buhari\u2019s stamina.\n\nSenator Ndume also commended President Buhari\u2019s bold welfare plans for the state, including the decision to build 10,000 houses for displaced persons and the provision of financing for a power plant.\n\nBut he urged the federal government to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d and fast-track its financing of army operations, especially the acquisition of improved fighting equipment.\n\n\u201cWe should now walk the talk by accelerating the release of funds on time,\u201d Senator Ndume said. \u201cThe army now has the numbers.\u201d\n\nA less hideous enemy\n\nWith the apparent death of Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, terrorist group ISWAP appears to have replaced Boko Haram as the new face of insurgency in the region.\n\n\u201cISWAP is more deadly, more sophisticated, have international connection, access to military armament and the likes, but the other side of them is that they don\u2019t kill civilians indiscriminately like the Boko Haram and in fact that was what ignited the fight between the ISWAP and the Shekau group,\u201d Mr Ndume said.\n\n\u201cNow the Shekau group have been virtually eliminated, it means that our Nigerian troops are going to face what they know specifically.\n\n\u201cWhat was frustrating them most was the indiscriminate killing of civilians and other soft targets, destruction of public property by the Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cBut now that the ISWAP is saying we are just going after the military or the armed forces or the security agencies. Our security agencies are up to the task; Our security agencies are up to the task and ready for them. They have engaged themselves and (ISWAP) have suffered serious casualties.\u201d",

The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gunmen Kill Five Security Personnel In Zamfara\n\n\u201cYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari also said the nation owes a debt of gratitude to military men and women, and security agencies currently tackling security challenges in the country, particularly the many who paid the supreme price.\n\nHe assured that the government will continue to support all the loved ones.\n\n\u201d I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity.\n\n\u201cAs I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that my administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country are well cared for,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said wounded comrades will get the best medical attention towards their full recovery and commended the military and security agencies for the synergy that translated into successes in restoring peace and order.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy pooling together the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari also assured that his administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building.\n\n\u201cConcerted efforts are being made to fast-track reconstruction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as people return to their homes.\n\n\u201cAlongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the carrot and stick,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said several interventions by the Federal Government had led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition.\n\n\u201cMany have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived in the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements.\n\n\u201cI would like, at this point, to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the President\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in bringing the war to a conclusive end.\n\nThe Commander thanked the President for the visit to the troops, which he said will greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Babagana Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor, Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen Farouk Yahaya, Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao and National Security Adviser, Maj Gen.

President Kaunda was visibly pained in his response and at some point he broke down and wept. It was obvious to me how disappointed he was about some of the challenges that have plagued our continent for decades since independence.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Kaunda\u2019s death should remind Africans of the vision of a free, strong, united and prosperous continent the pioneer leaders had for the people.\n\n\u201cLet us, African leaders and people, never let the labour of these heroes\u2019 past be in vain,\u201d he said.\n\nZambia Mourns\n\nKaunda died on Thursday following a struggle with pneumonia.
