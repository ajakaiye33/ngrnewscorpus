          "text": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has gone on a short recess to prepare its ruling on the bail application brought before it by the 12 detained aides of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe lawyer to the detained aides, Pelumi Olajengbesi, had prayed the court to admit the Igboho aides to bail.\n\nThe lawyer to the Department of State Services, I. Awo, told the court that he was not opposed to the bail of eight of the applicants.\n\nHowever, he vehemently opposed the bail of the other four applicants on the ground that the DSS\u2019 investigation has revealed their high complicity in the offence of arms\u2019 stockpiling.\n\nThe DSS lawyer argued that the four aides should not be granted bail in the interest of justice and national security.\n\nHe also stated that their investigation was currently ongoing and has not been concluded.\n\nAwo submitted that once investigation is concluded, the DSS would not hesitate to charge them to court.\n\n\u201cThe fear of the respondent is that if granted bail, they will not make themselves available for further investigation and possible prosecution,\u201d Awo argued.\n\nThe lawyer to Igboho aides, Olajengbesi, prayed the court to discountenance the argument of the DSS as it was unknown to Nigerian law.\n\nOlajengbesi stated that the Igboho aides have been detained by the DSS for 34 days since July 1, 2021, and are yet to be charged to court for any offence.\n\nHe argued that their continued detention violated the provisions of the constitution and was an infringement on their fundamental human right.\n\nOlajengbesi also argued that the DSS does not need 34 days to investigate a person that they claimed was found with firearms.\n\nOlajengbesi urged the court to release the Igboho\u2019s aides on bail and assured the court that the applicants would be available for further investigations.\n\nDetails later\u2026",

          "text": "The Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has appealed to bandits terrorising the country with seemingly unending abductions of students to leave schools in the country alone.\n\nThe minister made the appeal on Tuesday night when he featured as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nHe was reacting to the reported release of three more abducted students of the Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State.\n\nThe students were abducted by daredevil bandits on July 5, 2021 around 2am on the school premises along the Kaduna-Kachia Expressway, Damishi, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna.\n\nThe first batch of 28 of the students had spent 20 days in the kidnappers\u2019 den before their recent release. This was after payment of N50 million ransom.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the release of the three students, the minister said, \u201cI\u2019m elated; this is the kind of news is what I want to be hearing everyday that they should please return our children to us. I am so happy for these children and their parents but I appeal, like I have been appealing \u2014 I was in Katsina to plead with the air service men who are flying that area to please.\n\n\u201cI encourage our military, they are doing tremendous job of following up these kidnappers and these bandits but I appeal to the bandits and whoever talks to them, please leave our schools alone.\n\n\u201cWe already have many issues from Kagara to Jangebe to all the places, they have just been disrupting school activities for our children, this is unprecedented. The atmosphere of insecurity is a big setback for us in the school agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad to have these three back and I would be glad to have all of them back,\u201d Nwajiuba added while assuring parents that the government would do everything possible to secure the release of other abducted students.\n\nMany Nigerians have questioned the capability of the Nigerian security forces in dealing with bandits and insurgents, especially in the Northern part of Nigeria which has been a hotbed of killings and kidnappings of late as rampaging bandits terrorise the people of the region.\n\nKidnapping has become a sordid menace and a lucrative \u2018enterprise\u2019 in Nigeria as the West African nation\u2019s security situation worsens.\n\nThe abduction of students in Kaduna State is not the first in the history of the nation. Non-state actors had in the past abducted hundreds of secondary school students from Kankara in Katsina; Jangebe in Zamfara State; Kagara in Niger State; Chibok in Borno State; and Dapchi in Yobe State, amongst other mass and sad abductions.\n\nAside from the kidnapping of students from schools, hundreds of Nigerians have also fallen victims to kidnappers in recent times and their families have had to part with millions of naira to secure their release after days or even weeks of excruciating pains and agony. Some families have not been so lucky, however, as the daredevil kidnappers rape and kill their victims even after receiving ransom.\n\nAside from payment of ransom, the condemnable venture feeds a growing illicit trade in illegal organ trafficking. Kidnappers also sometimes use their victims for ritual purpose.\n\nThe Senate had proposed a bill seeking to prohibit the payment and receipt of ransom for the release of any person kidnapped, imprisoned or wrongfully confined.\n\nAccording to the bill, Nigerians who pay ransom to kidnappers and kidnappers who receive ransom risk 15 years imprisonment.\n\nBut many Nigerians including human rights activist, Femi Falana, SAN, have flayed the upper chamber and described the bill as stupid. They noted that the National Assembly should instead focus on ensuring they make laws that guarantee adequate security for every Nigerian.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s interior design industry needs its Ladipo market, for collective efficiency \u2013 Tomi Bamgbelu",
          "text": "In this interview, Tomi Bamgbelu, Creative Director of SpazioIdeale, speaks on the interior design industry, its impact on the future of work, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. She also charges organisations to be intentional with their office spaces, to improve employee productivity.\n\n1). What is your take on the current state of Nigeria\u2019s interior design and space transformation industry?\n\nThe interior design and space transformation industry in Nigeria is evolving and has gained some momentum but it is not quite Uhuru. Compared to developed countries and the likes of South Africa on the continent skilled in interior design, Nigeria has a long way to go.\n\nThere is a growing awareness among Millennials, baby boomers, and even Gen Z about the need for interior designers able to create a contemporary ambience in their offices and homes. However, this interest is still low and prevalent in a few segments of society, such as the middle, upper class, and commercial segments of society.\n\nOne predominant raw material used in interior design is processed wood and laminated boards, and this, like other related materials, is still being imported. I believe there is room for much-needed growth in other segments of the industry, such as manufacturing, as it is closely related to the interior design industry.\n\nThese developments will significantly improve the interior design industry, create job opportunities, attract FDI via exports to other countries, and improve the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n2). How was the industry affected by the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nI do not think the industry was significantly impacted by COVID-19, because though not at full capacity, things went on as usual. From my interaction with other interior designers, I gathered that many people had jobs during the pandemic, with existing and even new clients seizing the opportunity to design their home offices.\n\nHowever, the impact was felt indirectly from related industries like manufacturing, where the lockdown, border closures, and the country\u2019s general economic situation necessitated the steady increase in the cost of goods used for projects, as a result of FOREX concerns.\n\n3) How did SpazioIdeale tweak its business model to navigate the effects of the pandemic?\n\nWe created client retention strategies to ensure we survived the pandemic, but we didn\u2019t have to do much. We planned to pivot to manufacturing and to infiltrate a different market segment at some point but haven\u2019t done this due to current project overload. We see the market for the freelancer or remote working population, as many people worked from home in 2020. And in conjunction with a sister company in Ijoko, we will tap into it and launch soon.\n\nHowever, we targeted the healthcare industry because hospitals, HMO providers, and hospital equipment manufacturers and providers were doing well at the time. Our operational flexibility and proper strategy got us to pivot and focus promptly on that specific industry, and this ensured that we remained relevant at the height of the pandemic.\n\n4). What distinguishes SpazioIdeale from other industry players?\n\nThe SpazioIdeale process sets us apart from other players. We have an airtight process that ensures that we deliver excellent quality to our clients; this has helped us retain repeat clients such as Paystack, SoFresh and many others.\n\nAll SpazioIdeale\u2019s processes revolve around two key pillars; design and execution, which are delivered to clients over time. Project deliverables feature a distinctive trademark of creative design, experiential spaces, and excellent execution, as usual. Our slogan is \u201cconnecting people to spaces\u201d, so all projects are designed with an experiential feature to enable clients to create memories through their interaction and flow with people within the space\u201d\n\n5. What are some of the challenges facing Nigeria\u2019s interior design industry?\n\nThe biggest challenge is probably the vulnerability of the manufacturing industry and its correlatedness with the interior industry. Though some of the items we use can be made locally, we are mostly import-dependent due to different concerns.\n\nAgain, the quality of vendors and artisans and the absence of professional associations to monitor interior design are other issues. Many people think interior design is purely aesthetic; have a good eye for colours, and voila! you can be an interior designer. There are many things involved in designing spaces for people. Form follows function, and designers must communicate the vision of the company in its space.\n\nIn many industries in more advanced climes, companies cluster together geographically for joint advantage. In the United States, for instance, carpet makers can be found in Dalton, Georgia; furniture makers in High Point, North Carolina; automakers in Detroit; film and TV in Hollywood, diamond sellers on 47th Street in New York and so on in Silicon Valley, Madison Avenue etc. This is similar with watchmakers in Geneva, or manufacturers of ski boots in Montebelluna of ceramic tile makers in Sassuolo, Italy, or even a Ladipo, in Lagos for vehicle spare parts. Nigeria\u2019s design industry needs such a cluster, that improves collective efficiency, allows them trade within themselves, and make the right investments to move the industry forward.\n\n6. What are key lessons Nigeria can learn from developed markets in space transformation?\n\nI think Nigeria needs to create structure and an enabling environment for design. We need to develop the manufacturing sector and other sectors that impact interior design and the industry at large, encourage co-creation and collaboration, etc. Also, we should learn why space transformation is important, and how it affects/improves lives, etc.\n\n7. What is your outlook for the interior design sector in Nigeria?\n\nI believe there will be more growth over the next few years. We have been evolving over the years and will continue to do so, not just in Nigeria but in most parts of Africa. Asides from South Africa, Nigeria is the next largest industry in interior design on the continent. With more commercial, enterprise, and startup activity, we expect to see more office designers, especially from Nigeria, expanding to other African countries with lesssophisticated interior design industries.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

And wherever these indices are absent, there\u2019s bound to crisis, distrust among the people.\n\nTherefore, to avoid witnessing these crises and put the communities on the path of peace and development, Ndigbo who aired their views on this issue advocate that these ingredients that ensure peace in communities be enshrined in the constitutions of Igbo communities and strictly adhered to.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Majority Leader of the Abia State House of Assembly, Chief Solomon Akpulonu, rotation of leadership positions would reduce agitation and give a sense of belonging to all sections of communities.\n\n\n\nAkpulonu explained that if there is a law on rotation in a given community or town, there will be less agitation on who occupies a particular leadership position at a given time. He further explained that there is no community, state or zone that doesn\u2019t have competent hands that can efficiently man leadership positions at all levels.\n\n\n\nAkpulonu who represents Obingwa East State Constituency, added that rotation would boost inclusiveness, peace, unity and harmony which he said, are essential ingredients for the development of society.\n\n\n\nThe Majority Leader, however, stated that there are exceptions in monarchical system of leadership in communities and nations where leadership cannot be rotated and remains a life-time affair.\n\n\n\nIn his words: \u201cI think there is need for a law for rotational leadership in any community. It should be made a constitutional matter; you can only exempt communities and nations that operate monarchial system of leadership. Law on rotation will reduce the increasing level of agitation from all quarters which are now threatening to tear many communities, state and country apart.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will also boost inclusiveness, peace, harmony, love for one another and unity which are the essential ingredients for the development of our communities, state and nation. It will enthrone equity and justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be less rancour because people are assured of a sense of belonging and a sense of ownership of the community. No section will feel cheated or marginalised by the dominant group. No section will dominate others as there will be respect for rights of the minority. Some people are saying that certain sections or zones lack competent hands to occupy leadership positions, but this is not true.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout rotation, some parts of the community will never produce the leader of a given community. And that won\u2019t be good for the unity of the community. We must promote such ideals that will enhance our unity in diversity. One of such is inclusiveness. You don\u2019t beat a child and expect him not to cry. This is why you see some of these agitations rising up daily.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe called for the insertion of the law on rotation in the Nigerian Constitution to address the fear of domination of the minority by the majority groups.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a law on rotation of positions in her constitution. This will address the fear of domination of the minority by the majority groups. Such law will even address the kind of marginalization and second-class citizenship the Igbo people have been subjected to in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his contribution, the traditional ruler of Umuogudu Akpu autonomous community in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Eze Godwin Ogba, affirmed that there are evident leadership crises among Igbo communities which he attributes to disobedience to existing traditional institutions/rules.\n\n\n\nEze Ogba pointed out that there are many prominent men and women in some communities who see themselves as kings, or kingmakers and who always gang up to allocate amenities of their communities when offered without prior knowledge of the traditional ruler in charge of the community.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the traditional ruler notices an error in his community and decides to speak against it or insists it has to be fairly done, owing to the fact that such amenities are owned by the people, those selfish individuals will oppose it thereby generating crisis.\n\n\u201cIn the olden days, the ward councillors are answerable to their traditional rulers in which case they bring information and messages from government down to them and when that is done, the traditional ruler in conjunction with his cabinet, ward councillor and stakeholders, would call the attention of the community members to educate and possibly distribute the incentives or amenities to them. But these days, what obtains is the opposite and it has been causing a lot of conflicts in community leadership in Igbo land.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf leadership positions are rotated and built into the constitution as the way to go, it will reduce the struggle for supremacy which is currently noticed in our various communities; it will make leadership positions rotate from kindred to kindred. With that, peace will reign. So for me, it will be a beautiful thing if Igbo communities make rotation of leadership positions a constitutional matter,\u201d Eze Ogba suggested.\n\n\n\nAlso contributing, Hon. Eze Uchechukwu Izekwe, a former councillor of Umuogudu Akpu ward II, said that imposition of candidates is a serious factor that triggers conflicts in Igbo community leadership, owing to the lacuna created by lack of constitutional provisions.\n\n\n\nIzekwe observed that in Igbo communities, there are cabals who call themselves godfathers and who are bent on imposing candidates of their choice on others rather than the choice of the masses owing to the fact that there are no existing constitutional provisions spelling out how positions should be assumed by stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause it is not the wish of the masses, such leadership does not yield positive fruits to the people but few individuals, who are the beneficiaries of the arrangements. This means that such administration is crises-ridden from day one and would not engender development,\u201d Izekwe said.\n\n\n\nSuggesting the way forward out of Igbo community leadership crisis, a legal practitioner, Mr. Ugwoke Stephen pinned the root of the problem of Igbo leadership crisis on disobedience to constituted authorities and unwritten rule of law.\n\n\n\nHe maintained that the principle of rule of law, equity and fairness should be upheld to resolve the challenges of leadership in Igbo communities. He regretted that lack of constitutionality of rotation process was the major defect which had fanned the embers of crises in the communities especially when it is time to choose leaders.\n\n\n\nHe advocated that rotation of power or leadership be made a constitutional matter in various towns to engender peace, unity and harmony.\n\n\n\nThe legal practitioner condemned the issue of god-fatherism, imposition of candidates and election rigging among others in Igbo community leadership processes.\n\n\n\nHe advised that the leadership structure or system should engender accountability and transparency to the masses and advised that every other leader in the community should always collaborate with their traditional rulers for better insight and direction.\n\n\n\n\u201cLeadership is a call to service which requires the support of everybody. Therefore, leaders at all levels should try and carry their subjects along and ensure that equity and fairness are observed to the letter. With that, leadership crises and challenges in Igbo communities will be eliminated and the world will be a better place for us,\u201d Ugwoke said.\n\n\n\nDue to lack of these peace factors, the struggle for kingship and other leadership positions has turned many Igbo communities into battle grounds, with some involved in protracted court cases. In some communities, factions exist and the resultant effect is lack of the much needed unity to enable them embark on developmental projects for which Igbo people are known. Sometimes, the struggles for the Igwe position lead to death as diabolical means are often applied to advance the struggle.\n\n\n\nIn some communities, even members of a family struggle for crown to the consternation of the people. One example is Amanuke in Awka North Local Government Area where two blood relations from Ezebuilo family are in court for the Igweship of the town.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra State for instance, more than half of the 191 communities have issues with their Igweship because of the involvement of government and some well placed persons in the communities who engage in circumventing the laid down means of selection/election. Some people who do not even merit occupying the community\u2019s throne in the Igbo traditional consideration are now forcing themselves into the exalted position, using their acquired wealth to buy support in their communities.\n\n\n\nIn fact, it has become a regular occurrence for communities to march to the Government House in Awka to complain either for or against their traditional rulers, thereby creating tension in most communities. Sometimes, traditional rulers lock horns with their president-general, making it difficult for government projects to be executed peacefully and properly in those communities.\n\n\n\nIn Awka, Chief Austin Ndigwe is parading himself as the Eze Uzu Awka, even when the recognised traditional ruler, Obi Gibson Nwosu, who has been on the throne for over 30 years, is still alive. Surprisingly, some people in the community are urging the man parading himself as the Igwe, to carry on.\n\n\n\nA community leader in Umuoji, Idemili North Local Government Area of the state, Chief Tochukwu Mmodu, who recently led the people of the community on a protest to the Government House, wondered why the state government has refused to issue certificate of recognition to the person selected by the community as its traditional ruler. He said that although the community has selected Chief Anayo Okoye as the traditional ruler of the town, some individuals in the area have become stumbling blocks, thereby creating a leadership vacuum and stalemate in the town.\n\n\n\nIn Alor, Idemili South Council Area, which is the community of the Minster of Labour and Productivity, Senator Chris Ngige, there are two traditional rulers, one supported by the Minister and another who has the certificate of recognition from the state government. The Minister is supporting Igwe Collins Ebele Chukwumesili, while Igwe Mac Anthony Okonkwo is recognized by the state government. The Igweship tussle is also affecting the position of the President-General of Alor as two parallel groups emerged in the community.\n\n\n\nAlso, Nanka community in Orumba North Local Council Area, has been experiencing crisis as a result of the tussle for the throne of the town. There has not been total peace in the town since the coronation of Igwe Ezeilo following the death of the former traditional ruler of the community, Igwe Gilbert Oformata. Although Igwe Ezeilo has been on the throne for some years, a section of the community is still opposed to his kingship despite appeals by stakeholders in the town.\n\n\n\nHowever, the National President of the Association of South-East Town Unions, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe, in his response on the issue of the usual tussle associated with the selection process in Igboland, attributed it to the republican nature of the Igbo.\n\n\n\nWhile he agreed that rotation could be a way of reducing electoral tension in selection of leaders, it will still not be easy at the end of the day since those favoured by the rotation process will find among themselves so many qualified and potential leaders that arriving at a particular leader will still be a problem.\n\n\n\nHe nonetheless, preferred the Igbo republican system to the monarchy system of the South-West or the feudal system in Northern Nigeria where a supreme leader\u2019s view or position in a matter overrides the integrated views of the entire citizens.\n\n\n\nDiwe said: \u201cSuch tussles are reflections of the genetic republicanism of the Igbo man. The Igbo man is genetically republican, which means that administration is inclusive; governance in Igbo land is inclusive. Everybody is involved and it is not easy in such an inclusive system for a leader to emerge with different interests and different backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnlike what is obtained in Igbo land, in the North the people are highly feudal, where the opinion of one person rides over others. It is the same thing in Yoruba land where there is a monarchical system that when the Oba says it, it is carried out.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, naturally, electing a leader in Igbo land will not be that easy. Also, even if you make it rotational, it is not also going to be easy. It is in the attempt to find a credible person, a worthy leader that is why some of these issues arise. Igbo are very skeptical and apprehensive of having the wrong person in a leadership position because of the inherent flaws and danger.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I will say it is one of the democratic processes but when it becomes too much, it will no longer be advisable. In essence, rotational leadership is also good and even if it is rotational, it doesn\u2019t mean it will fall on one person directly because among the people whose turn it is to produce such a leader, there will also be a problem of choice because in Igbo land, a lot of people are qualified. So the process of selection is usually not very easy.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the opinion of an Owerri resident, Mazi Alloy Iwundu rotational leadership positions in Igbo communities should be encouraged and made a constitutional matter, saying that would largely reduce the crises that emanate from the struggle to take up leadership positions in the communities.\n\n\n\nHe, however, said that the issue of Ezeship position may not be so easy as there are communities where the Ezeship position is hereditary and others by election or what he called \u2018political appointment.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me say this in brief, adding rotational leadership in the constitution for our communities is a brilliant idea. There will be fewer troubles. It will help all of us to achieve development.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy worry is the Ezeship position, like we know majority of the Ezeship positions are hereditary and it is because some people out of greed, bastardized the system and today the trouble about Ezeship positions being contested has been causing serious problems. Let us allow Ezeship position be hereditary.\u201d\n\n\n\nProf. Obasi Igwe, on his part, blamed the leadership crisis in all Igbo communities on political leaders who he said were bent on giving power to corrupt, malleable and least fit persons.\n\n\n\nProf. Igwe lamented that the election of Igwe, Obi, Oba, Eze, Onyendu and Onyeisi, is no more determined by the traditional norms of truth and justice, but by political, monetary and cultic connections.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe leadership crisis could centre on related domestic issues of eligibility and rivalry, or related to meddlesomeness of some external interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese contradictions could be positive and therefore promote, or negative and lead to the destruction of the commonwealth. Most crises in present-day Igbo communities arose from the political leaderships at the state and federal levels.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe situation is made more complex by the inability of the timid youths and intelligentsia to question the mis-governance of society. Now, any position in any Igbo village is for the highest bidder in politics, money and the cults; sometimes culminating in unnecessary loss of precious lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Igbo, a highly democratic and republican people, should restore their elevated moral standards, condemn ill-acquired wealth, extol meritocratic competitive emulation and the excellence it produces, ensure that leaders give account of their stewardship, and refuse to be used to rig elections, kill or harm people, or steal monies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Igbo are under a serious existential threat and unity is the only effective first step for a viable survival. But such unity is not possible with compromised leaderships sponsoring negative contradictions, and youthful populations with false consciousness aiding and abetting the evils of the political leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cWithout positive action now, you might complain and worry till eternity, with things only getting worse. Others elsewhere successfully did it, and it always works,\u201d Igwe said.\n\n\n\nFor the former President- General, Ihiagwa Autonomous Community, Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State, Emeka Nkwoada, the best way to ensure equity, justice and peace is the adoption of rotational leadership which should be enshrined in the constitution.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn Ihiagwa where I come from, the village that produces the monarch cannot at same time produce the President-General of the town union. When Eze J.O. Muruako who hailed from Umuelem, died the community asked Umuchima to give them another king. That was how Eze Lucky Ajoku came to the throne.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen his reign comes to an end, the community knows the next village to produce the king and the one to produce the President-General. The arrangement has guaranteed peace and unity in Ihiagwa. If most communities where there are disputes can adopt this approach, such crisis will be a thing of the past.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuch arrangement gives everyone a sense of belonging and maintains peace and unity. I propose such arrangement for elections into political offices, up to the presidency. In a democracy, everyone should have a fair share and there should be equity,\u201d he stated.\n\nChief Ozoh Anaekwe, said crisis is stoked in Igbo communities by people who want to impose themselves or their cronies on the communities.\n\n\n\nAccording to Chief Anaekwe, the reasons for leadership crisis in some Igbo communities are simply not because of lack of equity, fairness and inclusiveness, but imposition, greed and selfishness by occupiers of such seats.\n\n\n\nFor him, leadership is about service to the people and whoever is fighting, quarreling, disturbing or forcing himself on the community is not doing so to serve the community. He is doing that to enrich himself or to use the position to get what he wants. It is for selfish interest.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are also aware that Igbo contribute money to develop their communities. So, some people fighting to be President-General of their communities do that to access the money contributed by the communities for development. They can do anything to be president-general of their community. For instance, now that government is paying presidents-general and the traditional rulers, some people want to become emergency civil servants, because of the payment from the government that makes them now semi civil servants. And this is one of the factors that make them lack integrity. They do not have respect anymore, because he who pays the piper dictates the tune, government pays them and controls them.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo responsible traditional ruler or president-general who knows what he is doing, will subject himself to the pains and disrespect of receiving money like civil servants from the government; a teacher will queue to receive his salary and a king will also queue to receive salary from the government, that is why the integrity of the king and the president-general is reduced.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the rotation of leadership positions in the communities, Chief Anaekwe said that it is good but it depends on the customs and traditions of the community. Communities must also stand their ground to reject people imposed on them by the government; you have your culture and traditions and must maintain it.\n\n\n\nFor Chief Tommy Ezeonwuka, the Ogilisi of Igboland, some of the factors, including lack of skills acquisition development, sports development, littering of corpses in mortuaries and bad leadership on the part of government, are responsible for disunity, insecurity and leadership in Igboland today.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello\n\nFederal Government on Tuesday said it has introduced a system of National Vehicle Registry, VREG, to tackle smuggling and dumping of stolen vehicles into the country.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed made this known while declaring open a one day zonal sensitization programme on the system, VREG for stakeholders in Kano.\n\nAhmed represented by her Director, Technical Services, Hajia Fatima Hayatu said Nigeria has been a hub of stolen vehicles as most Vehicle Identification Number (VIM) in the country were unregistered rendering the vehicles difficult to trace hence the need to introduce the system.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe National Bureau of Statistics confirmed that between 2015 and 2020, Nigeria imported an average of 400,000 vehicles with an average of 8% increase in import annually. While an additional 40% of vehicles are smuggled into the country annually, thus evading duty payment of which 22% of these vehicles are stolen vehicles.\n\n\n\nA case study also revealed that between October, 2018 to September, 2019 the country recorded over 1.8 trillion naira value of used vehicle importation. It was further revealed that Nigeria was hub of stolen vehicles as Vehicle Identification Number (VIM) of vehicles in the country were unregistered, consequently, vehicles within the shores of Nigeria cannot be traced.\n\n\u201cin a bid to address these challenges, the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning launched the National Vehicle Registry, VREG, which is a national repository of vehicular information that seeks to provide a singular platform through which all relevant agencies shall reference vehicular data with a view of ascertaining ownership and value information, capturing vehicular exchanges and utilizing the Vehicle Identification Number, VIN of all vehicles in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cVREG system will among others serve as a single source of validation at the point of vehicle registration while capturing and storing all vehicular information over the life cycle of every vehicle for the purpose of effective motor vehicle administration, ensuring the enforcement of penalties placed on vehicles by regulators across board and sensuring accurate monitoring, documentation and tracking of vehicular activities across the nation to enhance national security,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Acting Controller in charge of Zone B, Nigeria Customs Service, Uba Mohammed, said the system would assist in curbing insecurity and enhance revenue generation especially on vehicles.\n\nMohammed represented by the Controller, Kano/Jigawa Command, Comptroller Suleiman Umar, said, \u201cThis system, VREG could not have come at an important time than now when the Federal Government is working round the clock to better the lives of Nigerians and ensuring insecurity is curbed at all cost.\n\n\u201cThis initiative suit in with E-Customs Project that would signal the beginning of end-to-end automation of Nigeria Customs Service processes and procedure.

The court later adjourned the suit till August 18.\n\nAbout three weeks after he was declared wanted by the Department of State Security (DSS), the Benin Republic Police arrested Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho last month. The campaigner for Yoruba self-determination and leader of Ilana Oodua, was arrested while attempting to travel to Germany at Cardinal Bernardin International Airport in Cotonou.\n\nSince his arrest, he has been charged by the Benin government with obtaining fake passports and has appeared before a prosecutor at the country\u2019s Court of Appeal.\n\nEarlier in June, DSS operatives invaded Igboho\u2019s house, located in Soka, Ibadan, capital of Oyo State around 1:00 a.m. Two of his vehicles and some valuable properties were destroyed in the process. The spokesperson of the DSS, Peter Afunnaya, claimed that seven AK 47 rifles, pump action guns and 5,000 rounds of ammunition were recovered from his house after a \u201chot gun duel between them and Igboho\u2019s guards\u201d. The DSS also admitted that two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed in the process while a security agent was shot on the right hand. But Igboho denied owning the weapons, saying that they were not his and that security operatives planted them in his house to implicate him.\n\nIgboho\u2019s Ilana Oodua has led rallies in Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Ekiti, calling for the actualization of an independent and sovereign country for the Yoruba ethnic group and the eviction of herdsmen from South-west states.

We cannot allow this quagmire to continue because 2023 is near\u2026\u201d it was gathered.\n\nMeanwhile, the battle to control the party before the national convention stems from tendencies in the two major political blocs involved in the formation of the APC; the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nThe CPC, it was gathered, is now bent on producing the new national chairman of the party, with the argument that the ACN has had its fair share of producing national chairmen of the party in time past while the ACN faction is insisting that the CECPC should be dissolved as keeping them in place would jeopardise APC\u2019s chances in future elections.\n\nAn influential minister is leading the charge for the CPC bloc in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court judgement has exposed the underbelly of the APC. The minority judgement has shown that this is a fight between the ACN and the CPC. This is the end-game between the two powerful blocs in the APC.\n\n\u201cSome party leaders are asking that Buni should step aside and the national caucus should appoint a new caretaker committee, whose committee would be short, its mandate clearly spelt out, conduct credible congresses nationwide including the national convention, within a stipulated and publicised timeframe,\u201d a party chieftain explained, yesterday.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nTussle for the control of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) got messier, yesterday, as some members of the National Working Committee (NWC) moved against the National Chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nThe National Youth Leader, Sunday Ude-Okoye, confirmed to journalists, at the party National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, that there was a split in the NWC as no fewer than 10 members were against the continuation of Secondus as national chairman.\n\nThis is as seven deputy national officers have served the NWC a 30-day resignation notice. They include Diran Odeyemi, deputy national publicity secretary; Ahmed Bello, deputy national legal adviser; Umoru Hadizat, deputy national women leader; Divine Amina Arong, deputy national auditor; Hassan Yakubu, deputy national organizing secretary; and Irona Alphonsus, deputy national financial secretary.\n\nHowever, Secondus, in a swift reaction, said he remains in control of the leadership of the PDP. He spoke through his media aide, Ike Abonyi.\n\n\u201cI want to assure members of the party that the structure of the party is intact and Prince Secondus is the national chairman and anybody who resigns will be filled the next day and this party will work to victory in 2023 there is no going back about it.\n\n\u201cAll those who are looking for interim government few months to general election are taking us back to Egypt and nobody is ready to go back to Egypt. We have passed through this road before and we do not want to go back there.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun gathered that amidst rising tension in the opposition party, the PDP Governors Forum, has scheduled to meet on August 9 to fashion the way forward. The meeting is expected to take a decision on Ude-Okoye, who stormed out of a meeting of the NWC and demanded immediate resignation of Secondus. He called on PDP governors and other leaders to rise up and rescue the party. He threatened to resign within four days if Secondus does not quit.\n\n\u201cMr. Uche Secondus, the national chairman of the party is incompetent of managing the affairs of this party, he lacks capacity to manage PDP. There is a sharp division in our NWC right now; not only me, many more NWC members are more aggrieved than myself.\n\n\u201cToday, I have asked him in our NWC meeting to resign his position because he cannot lead this party to victory.\n\n\u201cI am also asking the leaders, the governors, the founding fathers, the youths, the women to rise up to rescue our party from the hand of incompetent leader like Secondus because he is not willing to take us to anywhere.\n\n\u2018Seven deputies have already resigned their positions because of Secondus. Many more people are also going to resign in the NWC. Right now, I can tell you that not less than eight to ten persons within the NWC members are very aggrieved.\n\n\u201cI am here to make it very clear to all Nigerians that if Secondus does not resign from the party, I am going to leave the party for him to eat the party and own the party. The governors, if they don\u2019t wade into this matter right now, I assure Nigerians that within the next three, four days, my letter will be public.\u201d\n\nHowever, a highly placed source told our correspondent that the notice of resignation by the deputy national officers was part of a grand plot to force Secondus out before the expiration of his tenure on December 10.\n\nThe source confirmed that apart from Ude-Okoye, who has threatened to resign, three other NWC members, including the National Secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri, the National Auditor, Mai Adamu Mustapha and the Deputy Chairma, North, Suleiman Nazif might resign in the next couple of days. The plot is to create a crisis situation so as to replace the NWC with a caretaker committee, which will preside over the December national convention.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that already governors elected on the platform of the PDP are divided with majority of them in support of the party chairman.\n\nThe source listed governors allegedly opposed to Secondus to include Nyesom Wike, Seyi Makinde and Ahmadu Fintri of Rivers, Oyo and Adamawa respectively. Governors with him, according to the source, include Godwin Obaseki, Edo; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi,Enugu; Dori Douye, Bayelsa; Samuel Ortom; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi and Darius Ishaku, Taraba while Ifeanyi Okowa and Emmanuel Udom of Delta and Akwa Ibom are said to be indifferent.\n\nIt was gathered that the Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who is chairman of the PDP governors is calling for caution. Tambuwal, it was also gathered, is proposing that rather than sack the NWC before the end of tenure, the party can fasttrack the conduct of the national convention.\n\nHowever, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party has activated its internal conflict resolution mechanism immediately it got the notice of resignation from the deputy national officers.\n\n\u201cWe call on all the leaders, stakeholder and members of our great party to remain calm as we collectively resolve these issues.\u201d\n\n\u2022National Reconciliation C\u2019tte meet in Ibadan\n\nMeanwhile, the National Reconcilation Committee under the chairmanship of former Senate president, Bukola Saraki, met with Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, and some aggrieved members of the party in the state towards brokering peace.\n\nThe committee met with Governor Makinde at the Governor\u2019s Office in Agodi, Ibadan, and thereafter met with some aggrieved members at Carton Gate Hotel, Idi-Ape, Ibadan. The third meeting, which was an enlarged one held in front of the Presidential Lodge, Government House, Oke-Oyinbo, Agodi, Ibadan, comprising both the aggrieved and non-aggrieved members of the party in the state.\n\nSaraki was accompanied by former Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim; former governor of Cross River State, Liyel Imoke; and former leader of the House of Representatives, Mulikat Adeola-Akande, who is also part of the aggrieved members of the party in the state.\n\n\u2022Vote of confidence in Ortom\n\nThe party has passed a vote of confidence on Governor Samuel Ortom and reaffirmed its support for him as leader of the party in Benue State.\n\nIts state chairman, John Ngbede, moved a motion for the vote of confidence at an expanded caucus of the Party which held at Government House on yesterday and was chorused by all other caucus members in the affirmative.\n\nHe posited that the PDP has total confidence in the ability of the Governor to lead the party to victory in the 2023 general election.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022APC faces \u2018legal ditch\u2019 over Supreme Court ruling in Ondo, legality of Buni\u2019s leadership called to question\n\n\u2022PDP in crisis of confidence, plagued by defections, resignations\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nFor the two main political parties in the country \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 the road to 2023 appears inauspicious. Both parties are not only bogged down by leadership crises, but they are also plagued by seemingly intractable survival battles. Strangely, since the APC was coupled together on February 6 , 2013, by the different tendencies that came together, it has never been able to form a Board of Trustees.\n\nThe ruling party is today facing stringent legal complications, which have thrown its leadership into confusion since last weekend, after a Supreme Court judgement in the Ondo State governorship election sounded the alarm. PDP, too, is not only contending with a crisis of confidence but it is also desperately afflicted by a spree of defections by governors, and lawmakers elected on its platform, which has been compounded by yesterday\u2019s resignations of top ranking party officials.\n\nThe reality of the delicate state of things in APC did not dawn on majority of members until the Supreme Court judgement in the Ondo State governorship election petition. The judgement suggested that the party would have lost the state to PDP had the opposition party\u2019s governorship candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, joined APC\u2019s National Caretaker Committee Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, in the suit. .\n\nThe technicality of the case had split the seven-man Supreme Court panel to a four-three majority decision, with the minority judgement led by Justice Mary Odili, arguing that the apex court should have sacked Governor Rotimi Akeredolu since Buni acted on behalf of the party. But the majority judgement delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim contended that since all the issues revolved around Buni, he should have been joined for the argument to be valid.\n\nThe crux of the debate followed the position held by some members of the party that as governor of Yobe State, an executive position, Buni could not at the same time act as the APC chairman, another executive office. They alleged that Buni contravened both Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 (iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nBut Buni and a few other like-minded party faithful disagreed and despite a plea by majority of party members to suspend last weekend\u2019s congresses for fear of the unknown, the Caretaker Committee went ahead with the exercise.\n\nTHISDAY had reported earlier this week that the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, acting on the instruction of President Muhammadu Buhari, had made desperate moves, after a meeting of all lawyers in the cabinet, to call off the congresses. This was for the fear that the hint from the Supreme Court judgement in Ondo State could come back to haunt the party.\n\nBut from all indications, reason is believed to have started prevailing, as governors elected on the platform of APC and other stakeholders are now considering the way forward. Their options are believed to include the possibility of cancelling the congresses to save the party from a myriad of potential future legal challenges.\n\nTo this end, a chieftain of APC, Okosisi Ngwu, has dragged the Buni-led caretaker committee before a High Court in Abuja seeking a nullification of the congresses. The plaintiff is also asking the court to declare the congresses held under Buni as illegal, flowing from the Supreme Court judgement that questioned the validity of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee.\n\nThe suit marked FCT/HC/CV/1824/2021 and dated August 2, 2021, listed the APC and all members of the caretaker committee as defendants.\n\nThey are Buni, Isiaka Oyebola, Ken Nnamani, Stella Okorete, Governor Sani Bello, Dr James Lalu, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon. Akenyemi Olaide, David Leon, Abba Ali, Prof. Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed, and Senator James Akpanudoedehe.\n\nIn the originating summons filed by his counsel, Chief Oba Maduabuchi (SAN), Ngwu is further asking the court to dissolve the committee, as there was no organ of the party or any such organisation in the party\u2019s constitution as Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nHe equally sought a declaration that pursuant to Section 87(4)(b)(1) of the Electoral Act (as amended), only the National Executive Committee of a political party could validly appoint a date for the holding of primaries for the nomination of the governorship or other candidates of the political party.\n\nNgwu, who hinted that he had wanted to contest the position of the National Chairman of the party in 2018, urged the court to grant an order setting aside all actions and decisions taken by members of CECPC of the party.\n\nAPC is, apparently, yet to agree on a strategy to approach the quagmire it has found itself in. But what the majority of members feel the party can minimise its losses by, first, cancelling the congresses and, then, fathoming a way out of the legal ditch it has found itself.\n\nIn PDP, the last few months have been palpably discomforting, with the party losing about three governors and several state and federal lawmakers to different reasons, including not being able to tag along anymore with the PDP leadership.\n\nLeading the defection train was the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, followed by Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade, and, most recently, Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle, whose defection had also raised some constitutional concerns following the manner of his emergence as governor.\n\nMatawalle had emerged governor after the 2019 general election, sequel to a Supreme Court judgement that disqualified all APC candidates across the board over allegedly flawed primary elections. Although PDP is still in court challenging Matawalle\u2019s defection and asking the Supreme Court to sack him, a fresh crisis has erupted in the party, with the National Youth Leader, Sunday Udey-Okoye, berating the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus.\n\nThis was soon taken a notch up as seven officials of the party tendered their letters of resignation yesterday over allegations of marginalisation by the party leadership.\n\nBut Secondus has described what the youth leader said as the price of leadership, wondering why he did not realise that the deputies that resigned were not given any official duties in the last three years or since the inception of the party.\n\nOther members of the NWC, it was gathered, equally berated the national youth leader, alleging that he is being economical with the truth. One of the NWC members, who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity, stated, \u201cAsk the deputies that resigned, they knew before they contested elections to become officials of the party; knew that they are not entitled to attend the NWC meeting, less invited.\n\n\u201cIf they were not sponsored, why are they just waking up from their slumber? This is a constitutional issue. There is nothing we could do unless the constitution of the party is amended.\n\n\u201cThis has been the case right from the formation of the party. They are being used.\u201d\n\nThe NWC member said, a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting would soon be summoned to address the issues raised.\n\nSecondus, in his response, claimed that the issue was not personal but the price of leadership. He alleged that the seven deputies that resigned were sponsored, as they were all aware of their status before being elected.\n\n\u201cThe National Working Committee of our great party at its meeting today received the notice of the resignation from deputies, who are elected members of the National Executive Committee,\u201d Secondus confirmed.\n\nResponding to the emergency, National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said, \u201cThe meeting of the National Working Committee and the deputies immediately took place to dialogue on the issues that were raised. The party will look into the grievances raised by members of NEC as well as members of the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cThe internal conflict resolution mechanism of our party has also been immediately activated to put these issues behind us. We call on all the leaders, stakeholder and members of our great party to remain calm as we collectively resolve these issues.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with newsmen, the youth leader blamed Secondus for the problems of the party.\n\nThe youth leader stated, \u201cMr. Uche Secondus, the national chairman of the party, is incompetent of managing the affairs of this party, he lacks managerial capacity to manage PDP. He had made sure that many departments of the party did not function as effectively as it ought to function. Mr. Chairman has nothing to offer to the party; only to come here and deceive us.\n\n\u201cThere is a sharp division in our NWC right now, not only me, many more NWC members are more aggrieved than myself.\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, National Organising Secretary of the PDP, Col. Austin Akobundu, confirmed the resignation of seven members of the NWC.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that by the PDP constitution, the seven different deputies that resigned were not truly eligible to attend meetings of the NWC. It is the substantive officers that attend the NWC, except where in the absence of the substantive official.\n\nBut the deputies have been agitating that they should be allowed to attend the main NWC meeting as the information reaching them after NWC was always secondary. The seven national officers of PDP, in their separate letters, addressed to National Secretary of the party, Senator Unaru Tsauri, on Tuesday, alleged being side-lined and unfairly treated by the National Chairman, Secondus.\n\nThose who have resigned are Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Woman Leader, and Deputy National Auditor.\n\nOne of the deputies that resigned, who pleaded anonymity, also berated the Secondus-led NWC for allegedly treating deputy national officers \u201cas if we are nobodies.\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify the statement, the officer said, \u201cSince our election in 2017, we (deputy national officers) have only met with our chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, thrice. It is not as if he called us; on those three occasions, we sought audience with him.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying part is that during Christmas and Sallah festivities, the NWC would visit our governors. They would collect money and other items but I can tell you that they don\u2019t share anything with the deputies. To him, we are just a necessary evil to be tolerated but never to be catered for.\n\n\u201cWe all have our constituencies and our followers but from the way we are being treated, it appears they see us as nothing but appendages forced on them by the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAs at press time, the Secondus-led NWC was meeting and a statement expected from the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum said it received with regrets and sadness the recent rumblings in the party. It called on all members of the party and stakeholders to remain calm in the face of the developments.\n\nThe PDP governors, in a statement by their chairman, Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, said, \u201cWe plead with all aggrieved persons and those with the interest of the PDP at heart to keep their gun powder dry, as efforts are being made in consultation with members of the PDP Board of Trustees and other stakeholders to resolve all contending issues.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum has scheduled an emergency meeting to discuss the affairs of the party and the way forward. The PDP, as the only remaining hope of the nation for good governance, must show an example to Nigerians and also take advantage of the current disarray in the APC and its rudderless government.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Gbajabiamila extols CBN governor\u2019s diligence\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu: He is an invaluable asset to Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari today congratulated the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, and wished him well on his 60th birthday. Buhari appreciated the economist and banker for his patriotic service to the country at a time of difficult economic challenges.\n\nThe president prayed that Emefiele\u2019s efforts would yield positive dividends for the generality of Nigerians to reap from.\n\nBuhari equally wished the CBN governor good health and greater service to fatherland.\n\nIn a congratulatory letter to Emefiele, which was personally signed by the president, he stated, \u201cIt gives me great pleasure to rejoice with you on the occasion of your diamond jubilee. Kindly accept the felicitations of myself, family and Nigerians at this auspicious milestone.\n\n\u201cAs Governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, you have rendered selfless service to your country at a most challenging period of our economic development, and I salute your commitment, passion and doggedness. As you continue to build on these achievements, it is my hope that your efforts translate to more positive results on the nation\u2019s economy for improved living standards we envisage for our people.\n\n\u201cWhile using this medium to pray Almighty God to bless you with many more years in good health and service to your fatherland, please accept my best wishes and personal regards.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, also congratulated Emefiele and praised his diligence and commitment to the country\u2019s economic project. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, Gbajabiamila said Emefiele was one Nigerian whose track record of excellence was there for all to see.\n\nThe statement quoted the speaker as saying regarding Emefiele, \u201cNigeria and Nigerians are proud of him for his services.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, felicitated Emefiele, describing him as an invaluable asset to Nigeria.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, noted that the CBN governor\u2019s input to the country\u2019s economy and the financial sector were clear testament to his visionary leadership.\n\nThe governor said the renowned economist and banker had used his wealth of experience for the benefit of the private sector, especially the banking industry, at a most challenging period of the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOn behalf of my adorable wife, Ibijoke, and the good people of Lagos State, I heartily congratulate the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on the occasion of his Diamond Jubilee.\u201d\n\nThe governor said attaining the age of 60 year in grace was worth celebrating, considering Emefiele\u2019s remarkable track record in the financial world. He said the CBN governor\u2019s performance had earned him an enviable place as Governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank.\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, over the years, Emefiele has proved his worth as a good manager of human and capital resources in both the private and public sectors.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cAs CBN Governor, Emefiele has been a worthy partner in our administration\u2019s quest to build a Greater Lagos for millions of Lagosians, by creatively working with us in some areas of intervention aimed at building institutions for sustainable economic growth and development of Lagos State.\n\n\u201cMr. Emefiele\u2019s intellectual input to the nation\u2019s economy in this globally economic depressing period has helped in no small measure to stabilise the business environment, while restoring confidence in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAs Mr. Godwin Emefiele celebrates his Diamond Jubilee, I wish him good health and more fruitful years. I pray that God will continue to preserve and grant him good health to enable him render more service to humanity and our dear nation.\u201d\n\nEmefiele has been at the forefront of Nigeria\u2019s economic diversification drive, by providing the critical financial support to operators in the non-oil sector. Under him, the CBN has rolled out massive development interventions in critical sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThe interventions Emefiele include the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF); Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS); Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI); Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF); the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP); and the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), among several other development finance initiatives in the past seven years.\n\nUnder the MSMEDF, which charges nine per cent interest rate, the disbursement of over N83.9billion to 216,704 beneficiaries was recorded at the end of 2020. AGSMEIS is an initiative of the Bankers\u2019 Committee, in collaboration with the CBN, that was also set up to improve access to affordable and sustainable finance by agri-businesses and MSMEs.\n\nThe initiatives have enhanced job creation and boosted the managerial capacity of agri-businesses and MSMEs.\n\nSo far, a total of N111.7 billion has been disbursed to 29,026 beneficiaries. Furthermore, a N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility was introduced in March 2020 as a stimulus package to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on households and MSMEs across the country. The fund has been increased N400 billion.\n\nIn terms of the ABP, over 3.1 million farmers have been financed for the cultivation of crops across 21 agricultural commodities. Also, a total of 3,107,890 farmers have been financed for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions in the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from the inception of the programme till date.\n\nFor the YEDP, which was launched in 2016 to enhance the deployment of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of Nigerian youths to achieve maximum economic development, a total of N173.4 million has been disbursed to over 67 beneficiaries. The target beneficiaries are members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), non-NYSC (but not more than five years post-NYSC), holders of verifiable tertiary institution certificates, and artisans with First School Leaving Certificate or a technical certificate or accredited proficiency certificate from the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\nEmefiele also earned his stripes as one of the heroes of the country\u2019s efforts to contain COVID-19. The CBN under Emefiele\u2019s leadership was proactive in mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the economy.\n\nImmediately the first COVID-19 case was recorded in Lagos, the Emefiele-led CBN took decisive actions and unfolded a raft of measures to moderate the effect of the virus on households, businesses, and the economy.\n\nEmefiele was also instrumental to the formation of the private-sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), which was able to mobilise billions of naira and has immensely supported the country\u2019s COVID-19 fight by setting up healthcare facilities across the country and distributing palliatives to states. It also established a health sector grant to promote research in the development of vaccines, among other policy measures.\n\nThe health sector facility has provided loans to pharmaceutical companies to expand and open drug-manufacturing plants in the country, and it has helped hospitals and healthcare practitioners to expand and build health facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Austin Akobundu has confirmed the resignation of seven members of the National Working Committee (NWC) who resigned from their respective offices.\n\nAccording to the PDP constitution, THISDAY gathered, the seven deputies that resigned, are not entitled to attend meeting of the NWC.\n\nIt is the substantive officers that attend the NWC, except where in the absence of the substantive official. They have been agitating that they should be allowed to attend the main NWC meeting as the information reaching them after NWC is secondary.\n\nThe seven national officers of PDP in their separate letters addressed to the National Secretary of the party, Senator Unaru Tsauri, on Tuesday, alleged being sidelined and unfairly treated by the National Chairman, Uche Secondus.\n\nAmong those who have tendered their letters of resignation are the Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Woman Leader, and Deputy National Auditor.\n\nOne of the deputies that resigned berated the Secondus-led NWC for allegedly treating deputy national officers \u201cas if we are nobodies.\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify his comment, the officer said, \u201cMy brother, since our election in 2017, we (deputy national officers) have only met with our chairman, Prince Uche Secondus thrice. It is not as if he called us; on those three occasions, we sought audience with him.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying part is that during Christmas and Sallah festivities, the NWC would visit our governors. They would collect money and other items but I can tell you that they don\u2019t share anything with the deputies. To him, we are just a necessary evil to be tolerated but never to be catered for. We all have our constituencies and our followers but from the way we are being treated, it appears they see us as nothing but appendages forced on them by the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the NWC led by Prince Uche Secondus was in a meeting and a statement was being expected.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s embattled Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has deleted his infamous Facebook update in which he responded to his indictment in the United States with claims that he only assisted serial internet fraudster, Ramon \u2018Hushpuppi\u2019 Abbas, to get N300,000 clothes.\n\nKyari had taken to his Facebook hours in the wake of his indictment as announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on July 29, saying he barely knew Hushpuppi and imploring his supporters to disregard the allegations because he only helped the fraudster to get tailoring services.\n\nThe post had subsequently elicited thousands of derisive comments and further nailed the police chief as other evidences he could not deny began to pour in.\n\nKyari on Wednesday morning around 4am Nigerian time deleted the post, four hours after he had earlier edited it. There was no reason he gave, however, for deleting the obviously ridiculous post.\n\nThe infamous post had read, \u201cFriends: Abbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about 2years ago that somebody in Nigeria Seriously threatened to kill his Family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s Phone number and pleaded we take action before the Person attacks his family.\n\n\"We traced and arrested the Suspect and after investigations we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life And they are long time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the Suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\"Nobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to Save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\nLater, he saw some of my Native Clothes and Caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The Native Clothes and Caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and He sent somebody to Collect them in our office.\n\n\"Nobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s embattled Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, has deleted his infamous Facebook update in which he responded to his indictment in the United States with claims that he only assisted serial internet fraudster, Ramon \u2018Hushpuppi\u2019 Abbas, to get N300,000 clothes.\n\nKyari had taken to his Facebook hours in the wake of his indictment as announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on July 29, saying he barely knew Hushpuppi and imploring his supporters to disregard the allegations because he only helped the fraudster to get tailoring services.\n\nThe post had subsequently elicited thousands of derisive comments and further nailed the police chief as other evidences he could not deny began to pour in.\n\nKyari on Wednesday morning around 4am Nigerian time deleted the post, four hours after he had earlier edited it. There was no reason he gave, however, for deleting the obviously ridiculous post.\n\nThe infamous post had read, \u201cFriends: Abbas who we later came to know as Hushpuppi called our office about 2years ago that somebody in Nigeria Seriously threatened to kill his Family here in Nigeria and he sent the person\u2019s Phone number and pleaded we take action before the Person attacks his family.\n\n\"We traced and arrested the Suspect and after investigations we discovered there wasn\u2019t an actual threat to anyone\u2019s life And they are long time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the Suspect on bail to go and he was not taken to any jail.\n\n\"Nobody demanded for a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to Save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\nLater, he saw some of my Native Clothes and Caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k directly to the person\u2019s account. The Native Clothes and Caps (5 sets) were brought to our office and He sent somebody to Collect them in our office.\n\n\"Nobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him.

          "text": "On Monday, the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) commenced an indefinite strike over complaints of irregular payment of salaries, allowances, members welfare, health hazard allowances, among other issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strike action comes at a time when the country is battling the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of cholera in many states.\n\nWhen the resident doctors went on strike in April, patients across teaching hospitals in the country were stranded and abandoned. TheCable had also reported how the strike was said to have contributed to the death of a newborn at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).\n\nSpeaking on the latest action, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, NARD president, said: \u201cResident doctors constitute the highest number of doctors in teaching hospitals in Nigeria, so invariably, it is mostly us who are at the first point when patients present at the hospital.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkhuaihesuyi\u2019s comment implies that the doctors who are not on strike will be overwhelmed, given that the country is battling other health issues.\n\nIn view of his comment, what does the strike mean for the health sector?\n\nTHIRD WAVE OF COVID-19 IS HERE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria has witnessed a steady rise in the number of COVID cases in recent days. The country recorded 505 fresh infections on Tuesday.\n\nOsagie Ehanire, the minister of health, had on Monday said available data indicate that the country is already experiencing the third wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAll data indicate that we are now no doubt in the third wave of resurgence of the SARS-COV-2 infection, which we saw coming long ago,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\nFrom July 20 to August 3, at least 5,586 cases were recorded in the country, with 34 deaths reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLagos, which is the epicenter of the pandemic, recorded a daily average of six deaths in isolation centres in just one week, while 4,300 new infections were confirmed in July.\n\nThe positivity rate rose to 8.9 percent, which is an eight-fold increase when compared to the figure recorded a month ago, according to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos state.\n\n\u201cThe situation at hand should rightly alarm all of us,\u201d the governor said.\n\nEven more alarming is that the Delta variant of COVID-19, which has been linked to increased infection rates, has been recorded in six states since the first reported case in the country on July 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe highly infectious variant has been recorded in Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, Plateau, and the federal capital territory (FCT).\n\nASIDE FROM COVID, CHOLERA IS ALSO KILLING NIGERIANS\n\nAmid the global COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of cholera in many states has also killed 526 people.\n\nBased on the recent data released by the NCDC, 18 states and the FCT have reported cholera cases since the beginning of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Nasarawa, Niger, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, and the FCT.\n\nAs of July 22, the suspected cases recorded in the affected states stood at 22,130.\n\nAccording to a report by SB Morgan (SBM) Intelligence, cholera killed 441 people in Nigeria in July alone. The report said Kano state recorded the highest number of deaths with 123 fatalities, followed by Sokoto with 86 deaths, and FCT 53 deaths.\n\nMONKEYPOX IS STILL A THREAT\n\nAs health workers are battling COVID-19 and cholera, small clusters of monkeypox cases are being reported by the NCDC.\n\nOn July 16, the Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) in Texas, US reported a case of monkeypox in a resident who recently returned from Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the DCHHS, the individual, whose name was withheld, is a resident of Dallas, Texas who travelled from Nigeria and arrived at Love Field Airport on July 9.\n\nOn July 20, Chikwe Ihekweazu, director-general of the NCDC, said the agency had recorded 59 suspected and 15 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the country.\n\nIhekweazu said Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, and Lagos states recorded the highest number of cases.\n\nRESIDENT DOCTOR STRIKE \u2014 HOW WILL THE HEALTH SECTOR COPE?\n\nIn a bid to address the shortage of manpower that the strike will cause in the coming days, and possibly longer, the health minister charged medical directors at federal and state hospitals to ensure there is no disruption in service.\n\n\u201cThe federal ministry of health is engaging resident doctors who have embarked on industrial action with a view to quickly resolving the issues,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201cWhile this is ongoing, medical directors at federal and state hospitals are directed to ensure that service delivery is not disrupted in their centres.\u201d\n\nBut will the directors be able to fill the lacuna left behind by the striking doctors, as more and more patients seek medical attention?\n\n\u2018PAY MORE ATTENTION TO HEALTH WORKERS\u2019\n\nAdetokunbo Fabamwo, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), spoke to TheCable about the implications of the strike.\n\nFabamwo said the country\u2019s health sector is in a \u201cfragile state\u201d and called on the federal government to ensure that promises made to health workers are fulfilled.\n\n\u201cIf promises have been made they should be fulfilled and it should not get to the point where doctors will down tools. Nobody wants that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are needless deaths. The national government needs to pay more attention to health workers as a whole, not just doctors. The developed countries have made it so easy for nurses and doctors to come to the UK, US and Canada.\u201d\n\nAnother health expert who craved anonymity said although general healthcare delivery would be severely affected by the strike, COVID-19 treatment will continue without hitches.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely going to affect the health of the populace. We see a lot of patients every day. People that have health issues and emergency cases can\u2019t be taken care of. It is a very big issue,\u201d the health expert said.\n\n\u201cAt least the COVID-19 management centers are working. The doctors are working, anybody with suspected and confirmed cases can be managed but for the general healthcare, it is not easy for the people.\u201d",

The country recorded 505 fresh infections on Tuesday.\n\nOsagie Ehanire, the minister of health, had on Monday said available data indicate that the country is already experiencing the third wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAll data indicate that we are now no doubt in the third wave of resurgence of the SARS-COV-2 infection, which we saw coming long ago,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\nFrom July 20 to August 3, at least 5,586 cases were recorded in the country, with 34 deaths reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLagos, which is the epicenter of the pandemic, recorded a daily average of six deaths in isolation centres in just one week, while 4,300 new infections were confirmed in July.\n\nThe positivity rate rose to 8.9 percent, which is an eight-fold increase when compared to the figure recorded a month ago, according to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos state.\n\n\u201cThe situation at hand should rightly alarm all of us,\u201d the governor said.\n\nEven more alarming is that the Delta variant of COVID-19, which has been linked to increased infection rates, has been recorded in six states since the first reported case in the country on July 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe highly infectious variant has been recorded in Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, Plateau, and the federal capital territory (FCT).\n\nASIDE FROM COVID, CHOLERA IS ALSO KILLING NIGERIANS\n\nAmid the global COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of cholera in many states has also killed 526 people.\n\nBased on the recent data released by the NCDC, 18 states and the FCT have reported cholera cases since the beginning of the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Nasarawa, Niger, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, and the FCT.\n\nAs of July 22, the suspected cases recorded in the affected states stood at 22,130.\n\nAccording to a report by SB Morgan (SBM) Intelligence, cholera killed 441 people in Nigeria in July alone. The report said Kano state recorded the highest number of deaths with 123 fatalities, followed by Sokoto with 86 deaths, and FCT 53 deaths.\n\nMONKEYPOX IS STILL A THREAT\n\nAs health workers are battling COVID-19 and cholera, small clusters of monkeypox cases are being reported by the NCDC.\n\nOn July 16, the Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) in Texas, US reported a case of monkeypox in a resident who recently returned from Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the DCHHS, the individual, whose name was withheld, is a resident of Dallas, Texas who travelled from Nigeria and arrived at Love Field Airport on July 9.\n\nOn July 20, Chikwe Ihekweazu, director-general of the NCDC, said the agency had recorded 59 suspected and 15 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the country.\n\nIhekweazu said Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, and Lagos states recorded the highest number of cases.\n\nRESIDENT DOCTOR STRIKE \u2014 HOW WILL THE HEALTH SECTOR COPE?\n\nIn a bid to address the shortage of manpower that the strike will cause in the coming days, and possibly longer, the health minister charged medical directors at federal and state hospitals to ensure there is no disruption in service.\n\n\u201cThe federal ministry of health is engaging resident doctors who have embarked on industrial action with a view to quickly resolving the issues,\u201d Ehanire said.\n\n\u201cWhile this is ongoing, medical directors at federal and state hospitals are directed to ensure that service delivery is not disrupted in their centres.\u201d\n\nBut will the directors be able to fill the lacuna left behind by the striking doctors, as more and more patients seek medical attention?\n\n\u2018PAY MORE ATTENTION TO HEALTH WORKERS\u2019\n\nAdetokunbo Fabamwo, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), spoke to TheCable about the implications of the strike.\n\nFabamwo said the country\u2019s health sector is in a \u201cfragile state\u201d and called on the federal government to ensure that promises made to health workers are fulfilled.\n\n\u201cIf promises have been made they should be fulfilled and it should not get to the point where doctors will down tools. Nobody wants that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are needless deaths. The national government needs to pay more attention to health workers as a whole, not just doctors. The developed countries have made it so easy for nurses and doctors to come to the UK, US and Canada.\u201d\n\nAnother health expert who craved anonymity said although general healthcare delivery would be severely affected by the strike, COVID-19 treatment will continue without hitches.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely going to affect the health of the populace. We see a lot of patients every day. People that have health issues and emergency cases can\u2019t be taken care of. It is a very big issue,\u201d the health expert said.\n\n\u201cAt least the COVID-19 management centers are working. The doctors are working, anybody with suspected and confirmed cases can be managed but for the general healthcare, it is not easy for the people.\u201d",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2013. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until seven years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company has secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Project Manager.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "text": "Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda Bank, has raised $55 million in a Series B round at a valuation of $500 million. This comes after a recent Series A of $25 million announced by the company just a little over four months ago.\n\nThe latest round was co-led by existing investors Target Global and Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel. SBI Investment and other previous angels also participated.\n\nKuda plans to use the funds to build on its new services for Nigeria as well as prepare for a continental expansion. According to Co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda aims to build a new take on banking services for \u201cevery African on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of resource deployment in our operational entity, in Nigeria. But now we are doubling down on expansion and the idea is to build a strong team for the expansion plans for Kuda,\u201d Ogundeyi told TechCrunch, without disclosing which countries Kuda is eyeing.\n\n\u201cFor Babs and Musty, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,\u201d said Ricardo Sch\u00e4fer, the partner at Target Global. \u201cThe prospect of banking over 1 billion people from day one really stood out for me at the beginning.\u201d\n\nOgundeyi co-founded Kuda with the now CTO, Musty Mustapha, in the second half of 2019. The startup launched in Nigeria as a no-fees, digital-only bank with $1.6 million pre-seed funding. It has since witnessed significant growth.\n\nAs of November 2020, Kuda had 300,000 customers and was processing an average of $500 million worth of transactions per month.\n\nBy March this year, Kuda\u2019s registered users had more than doubled to 650,000, after the startup processed $2.2 billion a month earlier. Presently, Kuda has 1.4 million people in its user base.\n\nBeyond just basic financial services, Kuda now offers credit to its users by way of an overdraft allowance, which the company pre-qualifies the most active users for.\n\nIn the second quarter of the year, Kuda disbursed $20 million worth of credit to over 200,000 qualified users, with a 30-day repayment period.\n\nAccording to Ogundeyi, Kuda has seen \u201cminimal\u201d default because of its approach. \u201cWe use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer\u2019s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,\u201d he said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cKuda is our first investment in Africa and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months,\u201d said Andrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures.\n\n\u201cWith a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda\u2019s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting them.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much does it cost to educate a girl child? This is one of the questions that come to mind when trying to make sense of why there are more out-of-school girls than there are in school globally.\n\nConfirmed in findings by the United Nations, it is prominent in sub-Saharan Africa, where many people expect girl children to sacrifice their education to get married early.\n\nWith such expectations, girls are almost always deprived of opportunities for higher education, much less a career. However, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) says the situation is getting better, although the pace is slow.\n\nBut for a father willing to go against the norm in the 1990s, Nigerian-founded Patricia Technologies would not have the amazing brand manager it currently has.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the three years and six months since Rachael Akalia joined Patricia Technologies, she has taken on seven roles at the company, something she considers challenging but worth it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to a point where I\u2019ve realised what I love, that I want to grow where I\u2019m at. I\u2019m someone that always wants to fix a problem and being a brand manager helps me do that. But I don\u2019t fix the problem when it\u2019s a problem, I prevent it from becoming a problem. It\u2019s more of being proactive,\u201d Rachael revealed during a recent conversation at Patricia Technologies\u2019 HQ in Lekki, Lagos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael Akalia\n\nLiving across the river, aiming for the skies\n\nOne of eight children from Anambra State, Nigeria, Rachael spent her primary and secondary school years in Ikom, Cross River State with her mom and late dad. Before heading for the university, she spent her post-secondary school years with her uncle in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.\n\nBut, she almost missed out on a tertiary education.\n\nBeing the eighth child at a time when younger siblings were not permitted to be ahead of their older ones in school \u2014 and in some cases, marriage \u2014 Rachael had to wait two years before going to the university. And it didn\u2019t come easy.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, I told them, \u2018just register me for the exam, I promise, I won\u2019t pass it.\u2019 But I knew I was tricking them because there was no way I would not pass it. While I was home, I was studying and solving JAMB past questions. I also did a six-month training in basic computer knowledge and got a certificate.\u201d\n\nShe faced another hurdle when she got admitted to study economics at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, and her older sister, who took the same exams, didn\u2019t. The family decided that Rachael would go to school five months after school resumed.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t slow her down; she caught up on five months of work. Such was her resolve that she set a first-class honours target for herself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll the while, she had a nudge.\n\n\u201cI had this quote, \u2018Aim for the moon, and if you miss it, you land among the stars.\u2019 So, in my head, if I missed First Class, I\u2019d get a Second Class Upper. But I wasn\u2019t going home with anything less than that because I needed to show them that the investment was worth it.\u201d\n\nSeizing opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael knew that an education would open doors for her. And it did.\n\nThe entrepreneur in her was awakened when she took on the responsibility for some of her financial needs during her four years at the university.\n\n\u201cFor other dues, apart from my school fees which my uncle took up, I taught tutorial classes. In my department, they knew me as the \u2018Summary girl.\u2019 I would summarise big textbooks into five pages without missing out on any important details. This was all thanks to my English teacher in secondary school whose summary and comprehension lessons came in handy.\u201d\n\nWith time, she became the go-to person for detailed study and exam prep materials. Rachael, who says her handwriting is hard to miss, kept this up for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t her only shot at entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring her mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) year at a secondary school in Enugu State, where she taught accounting, commerce, and economics, she sold pastries and organised classes for the students. Realising that most students didn\u2019t understand why they were in school, she says she focused on making an impact, not on money.\n\n\u201cThey had this mentality that they didn\u2019t need to study. They were actually forced to go to school. The boys wanted to farm, and the girls wanted to get married. But I had to tell them that inasmuch as you want to do all those things, it is really important to get vital knowledge first. I encouraged them with my story, and it was a reorientation for them.\u201d\n\nSimilar stories of motivation do not always achieve desired results, but her efforts were not futile. The school recorded its first year of excellent West African Examination Council (WAEC) results in the subjects she taught, ending five years of abysmal results. This remains one of the high points of her life.\n\nMoving up at Patricia Technologies\n\nAfter her NYSC, Rachael got an unsatisfactory sales and marketing job in Port Harcourt. In her quest for a new challenge, she moved to Lagos after being invited for an interview following numerous applications.\n\n\u201cI was writing nothing less than 25 applications daily. I was following job sites, and whether I was qualified or not, I applied immediately I got a job notification. And I did this on my phone because I didn\u2019t have a laptop.\u201d\n\nWith seven interview invites in her inbox, she made her way to Lagos. She got three offers, the first of which she took. Rachael eventually discovered that the marketing job came with a lot of pressure and unrealistic targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, she had turned down an offer from Patricia Technologies in February 2018 because the startup was only a few months old, and she didn\u2019t understand its operations.\n\nJust when she decided to begin her search for a new job, Patricia reached out, asking why she turned down the offer. Hiding her excitement after a contract review, she accepted a role in the operations team and resumed on February 5, 2018.\n\n\u201cI knew that I would be excellent wherever I worked, but the only factor that might hold me back was a lack of experience. I just wanted to get experience. So, I was willing to take any role to start, figure out what I wanted to do, and start getting skills in that area. I believed that I would figure out a career path to follow within one year.\u201d\n\nAfter a few months in the operations team, she moved to the gifts department. That was where CEO, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, discovered she had skills in complaint resolution, customer handling, and digital marketing. She was better suited for relationship-based tasks with such a skillset, so Agbodje asked her to become the startup\u2019s customer service representative and social media manager.\n\nShortly after, the media department was created to handle graphics designing, content creation, and digital marketing. And after 11 months at the startup, Rachael became the head of the media team, but she knew there were more responsibilities ahead; Agbodje thought so too.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this thing my boss does at the beginning of the year; he weighs people\u2019s strengths and puts them in positions where they can magnify these strengths and better work on their skills. He said, \u2018Rachael, I have watched you for a while, and I think you have great customer service skills. I want to start a proper customer service team, which you will head.\u2019\u201d\n\nLeading a team of ten was a new challenge that came with greater responsibility which prompted her to take customer service courses on Udemy. She also read widely and followed successful companies. And this is her modus operandi for every new role she finds herself occupying.\n\nBy June 2019, the growth of the Patricia team necessitated the expansion of the customer service team to 35 people. Rachael promptly stepped into the role of supervisor, and a professional customer service lead came in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a reshuffle in January 2020, Rachael chose to be on the marketing team.\n\nFor Rachael, a recurrent theme with these changes in roles was how well they aligned with her life goals and how she often leaves a role more knowledgeable than she came in. But the management saw beyond that.\n\n\u201cI had a conversation with Chika, the Chief People Officer, about why I was moved to the marketing team. She said I was a growth facilitator and that I build whatever team I\u2019m in. And they needed to build the marketing team.\u201d\n\nRachael had a month to put creatives in the startup together under a team in preparation for a head of marketing who would soon come in. As a marketing executive, she worked directly with Ogunwede Rotimi, who she reveals also played an integral role in her growth.\n\nThis path led her to become the brand manager in June 2020.\n\n\u201cAnd this was more challenging because I have to embody the brand. I have to know what is good for the brand whenever I speak for the brand. I have to be the brand and make decisions that will affect the brand. So, I can\u2019t falter.\u201d\n\nRachael acknowledges how important bringing in experienced hires is in a business, and holding her current role for over a year, she has exceeded her growth expectations. She attributes this to being in an environment that facilitates growth.\n\nLife hacks and aspirations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRachael believes building habits takes consistency, and she constantly makes an effort to replace unhealthy habits with good ones. One way she does this is by setting alarms due to the management and organisational skills she picked up at a young age.\n\n\u201cI get to remind myself to do things. I have a reminder that tells me to sleep, drink water, call my friends, see a movie, call my mom, pay my tithe, take a stroll, and every other thing.\u201d\n\nA typical workday sees her responding to internal and external emails, setting up tasks to achieve weekly goals, liaising with other team leads to carry out their tasks, and having meetings. Essentially, she works with every team in the company depending on the startup\u2019s needs per time.\n\nOutside work, Rachael likes reading \u2014 or doing anything that increases her knowledge \u2014 travelling, eating, and writing.\n\nWhile she continues to embody the Patricia brand, Rachael ultimately plans to go back to school, something she has put on hold for a few years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom interpersonal communication to business transactions, technology is fast changing the conventional way of doing most things. And Africa has not been left out in the wave of groundbreaking innovations.\n\nMany young Africans are joining in the development of novel tech infrastructure and building products that cut across various fields.\n\nNonetheless, Africa\u2019s young population \u2014 aged 15 to 24 \u2014 make up more than 200 million of her over 1 billion populace. These youth account for a large chunk of the unemployed. Interestingly, of the 20 countries with the youngest population in the world, 19 are African.\n\nCombine this with the continent\u2019s worryingly low number of upskilled developers and a limited tech talent pool, and you have a situation that can hinder Africa\u2019s technological advancement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDissatisfied with this situation, Dauda Barry, a London-based Senegalese serial entrepreneur, was propelled to start Alida School in March 2021, an online coding school for Africans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlida School\u2019s Co-founder and CEO, Dauda Barry\n\nAfter getting a degree in computer science from the Queen Mary University of London, he founded Adama Robotics in 2016, an AI company that builds and sells educational robotic kits.\n\n\u201cBuilding up Adama Robotics, being part of the startup ecosystem in London, I began hearing about Lambda School. I liked the model; the fact that it shifts the risk from the students to the organisation. Then I thought, \u2018why not build a Lambda for Africa?\u2019\n\nFor context, Lambda is a US-based online coding school that offers a six-month training course with tuition deducted as a certain percentage from students\u2019 income when they land their first jobs.\n\nReports reveal that 60% of Africa\u2019s unemployed population are youth, a statistic that Mthuli Ncube, former Chief Economist at the African Development Bank (AfDB), describes as \u201c\u2026unacceptable for a continent with such an impressive pool of youth, talent and creativity.\u201d\n\nAnd Barry shares this view.\n\n\u201cYou know, we have the young, the growing, and the innovative in the continent; mobile Internet penetration is rising, while its cost is falling a bit. There are many tech startups in Africa, yet we produce fewer computer scientists and developers than the rest of the world. So I thought, \u2018how can we bridge this gap?\u2019\u201d\n\nA Statista report states that as of 2019, only 7.7% of households in Africa were estimated to have a computer at home. As Barry thought about building a Lambda for Africa, he wondered how students in the African market would access stable Internet and computers for classes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis question was answered when he paid a visit to Senegal in February 2021.\n\n\u201cI was in Dakar, and I noticed my cousin who was running a degree in computer science taking most of his classes remotely. Then later, he took me to the community centre, where they had computers and Internet for people to use. Then I thought, \u2018Oh! A Lambda School for Africa can work in Senegal.'\u201d\n\nRealising the feasibility, Barry began building Alida School upon his return to London in March 2021.\n\nThe initial plan was to teach young Senegalese how to code. However, upon announcing application openings for the first cohort on Twitter, things took a surprising turn.\n\n\u201cWe started to receive applications from Kenya, Nigeria, and Guinea Bissau. In fact, our current students in this first cohort are mainly from Kenya and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSo, the focus moved from Senegal to the rest of Africa.\n\nAnd by \u2018we\u2019, he\u2019s referring to himself and his co-founder. While searching for good tutors, he met his co-founder, George Chinedu Ikwegbu, a computer engineering graduate of Michael Okpara University, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Chinedu Ikwegbu\n\n\u201cThere I was on Twitter, reading through and learning from insightful threads as usual, when Dauda sent me a DM, introducing me to his plans for Alida School and asking if it was something I\u2019d like to join,\u201d Ikwegbu recounts.\n\nIkwegbu, who has a flair for teaching, didn\u2019t hesitate to jump on the offer.\n\n\u201cI have always loved teaching, and so I told him yes. We then talked about my proficiency in programming languages. After a series of tests and virtual coffee conversations, I became a partner and coding tutor at Alida School.\u201d\n\nA sustainable model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Alida School is cohort-based, with each cohort running for 12 weeks. Alida School provides schooling in mainly front-end web development, Git, and Vue.js, and the first cohort is currently eleven weeks into the programme. Classes are held virtually, from 7-9 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nBefore students are enrolled, they are interviewed. Barry believes this helps to filter out those who might not be committed to the course.\n\n\u201cOnline course completion is at 52-53% rate in the world today, and so George and I monitor the attendance and check for accountability tightly. During the interview, we make it clear that attendance is at least 90%,\u201d Barry says.\n\nTuition is paid via a hybrid model. Students make a part payment upfront, and then the rest is paid using an income share agreement (ISA) when they land their first jobs.\n\n\u201cSome of the students prefer paying the tuition upfront because to them, it helps with consistency. Knowing that they have paid for the classes, they can\u2019t afford to miss any,\u201d Barry adds.\n\nThe hybrid payment model is similar to that of Decagon Institute, a Lagos-based coding school that offers a six-month training for software engineers, using upfront payment or the ISA method.\n\nWhile the current fee of $180 is seemingly steep, Barry says it was reached after a lot of deliberation.\n\n\u201cCompared to our competitors in the West, who charge as much as $9,000, ours is somewhat fair. I\u2019m a big advocate of a business being sustainable. Initially, we wanted to charge higher, but we went and asked for feedback from Senegalese people, based on their monthly and average salaries, and $180 was the highest we could go.\u201d\n\nFor the time being, Alida School\u2019s primary means of revenue is from its paying customers, and Barry discloses that there are plans to apply for funding.\n\n\u201cEventually, we\u2019ll apply for funding, but for now, we\u2019re dependent on tuition. We\u2019re still a small team, and I think small teams are good. We\u2019ll be faster, and with time, extend our runway.\u201d\n\nChallenges so far\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIkwegbu says that a major challenge so far has been poor Internet connectivity.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I\u2019m taking a class, and suddenly the network cuts and students can\u2019t follow any more until after a while. This greatly affects us,\u201d he says.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Barry reveals that plans are underway for the school to partner with telcos and get subsidised data bundles for students.\n\n\u201cWe have maybe 60 to 70% of good Internet. So far, I\u2019ll rate it 8 or 9 out of 10, which actually is not great, but it could be worse. Hopefully, things improve with time. The plan is to partner with telcos to get a stable source of data for our students at subsidised rates.\u201d\n\nAlso, Barry shares that the startup has challenges with payments and transactions made to countries outside Africa. There are usually many glitches when students are trying to pay their fees.\n\n\u201cAs much as a lot of fintechs in Africa are really putting in the work, there\u2019s still a lot that can be done with getting funds across to bank accounts outside the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does the future hold for Alida School?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort term plans include adding more courses to the school\u2019s curriculum and expansion into more African countries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently recruiting tutors for back-end so that we can raise more full-stack developers. For the next cohort, new courses will be integrated into the platform like back-end, app development (iOS and Android) and Data Science,\u201d says Barry\n\nAlso adding that the big picture is to reduce the unemployment and poverty gap while raising the next generation of tech talent in Africa, Barry says, \u201cThere is a big need to raise local talents in Africa. A lot of companies are outsourcing their talent needs to European developers to carry out projects.\u201d\n\nAnother goal for the second cohort is a remote and physical expansion to cities in other African countries.\n\n\u201cOur long term plans include foraying into major tech growing cities in Ghana, South Africa, and Rwanda, and also establishing a physical school in Africa, where we can teach people in person,\u201d Barry reveals.\n\nAnd because the school currently runs an English speaking teaching method, most Senegalese students usually do not want to enrol.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried that they won\u2019t be able to follow through because of their English, so we\u2019re looking to employ someone who can teach coding in French, so we can get more applications from Francophone African countries,\u201d Barry shares.\n\nWith the various challenges that Africa\u2019s burgeoning tech scene faces, startups like Alida School will go a long way in creating and refining talents to bolster the growth of technological innovations on the continent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

The round was led by AECI, one of Africa\u2019s biggest agrochemical companies. South African investor E Squared Investments also participated in the round.\n\nFinance is not all Khula stands to gain from AECI. The startup will also be able to use AECI\u2019s vast distribution network to ensure its products reach more people.\n\nFintech startups receive most of the funds coming to Africa, but buoyed by the state of the continent\u2019s agro-industry, agri-tech startups are not too far behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntriguingly, the sector grew 44% year on year between 2016 and 2019 and in 2020 received $59.9m from investors, up from $48.5m according to Disrupt Africa\u2019s African Tech Startups Funding Report 2020 (PDF).\n\nFounded in 2018 by Karidas Tshintsholo, Matthew Piper, and Jackson Dyora, Khula provides farmers with software and a marketplace to grow their business.\n\nKhula does this using three primary products: the inputs app where farmers can access agricultural inputs from suppliers, a fresh produce marketplace where they can sell directly to wholesalers, and the Funder Dashboard that enables them to access finance.\n\nSince opening its doors to the public, the startup has reportedly onboarded more than 3,000 farmers and over 100 suppliers.\n\nWapipay raises $2.2 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft: Paul Ndichu Co-Founder Wapi Pay, Right: Eddie Ndichu Co-Founder & CEO Wapi Pay.

Between countries in the region, these charges could rise to about 20% of the amount to be sent.\n\nRevealing the purpose of the funds they received, E. Ndichu said, \u201cThese funds will help Wapipay diversify our product range and drive growth so that we can evolve remittances into real-time global cross-border payments, starting with Africa and Asia.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Tokyo 2020 Olympics showing has been near disaster, but change is happening",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe suspension of Nigeria\u2019s sprint queen, Blessing Okagbare, from further participation at the Tokyo Olympics last week, after testing positive for human growth hormone, coupled with an injury to Enoch Adegoke who pulled out of the men\u2019s 100 final on Sunday, appeared to have capped what had been shaping up to be an out-and-out disastrous showing by the ill-prepared Nigerian athletes at the games.\n\nThe above tragedies had come on the heels of the elimination of both the D\u2019Tigers and the D\u2019Tigress; the country\u2019s male and female basketball teams \u2013 the latter which had shown flashes of brilliance with stunning wins against the United States and Argentina prior to the games \u2013 as well as the disqualification of 10 athletes from the country for not meeting the minimum testing requirements. But the country\u2019s wrestler at the event, Blessing Oborududu, and long jumper, Ese Brume, have ensured that it won\u2019t return empty handed, by winning silver and bronze medals respectively.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s been an embarrassing showing by Africa\u2019s most populous country; an eloquent testimony of the terrible state of sports and everything else in the country. Sacramento Kings and D\u2019Tigers player, Chimeze Metu, painted a succinct picture of the situation while narrating the experience of the basketball team and other athletes in the hands of Nigerian officials at the games.\n\nYet, the Tokyo outing says something more than the obvious poor state of sports in Nigeria and the terrible attitude of sports officials. It has shown that there is a gradual shift, which is attributable to the fact that the country\u2019s sports is no longer driven by local content, but the Diaspora population, and the face of Nigerian sports is changing as a result.\n\nConceded that there is really nothing strange about Nigeria feeding a team of mostly foreign based players for a global competition \u2013 at least, that\u2019s been true of the country\u2019s national football team for as long as anyone can remember \u2013 however, while that\u2019s been true of football, understandably so, because the best of the players ply their trade in Europe, it\u2019s not been true of other sports. But that\u2019s changing, too, and the reason is much deeper than one adduced to explain the preponderance of foreign based players in football.\n\nThe country\u2019s list of 60 athletes who headed to Japan tells an interesting story. Of the 60, about 36 were either born, raised or trained in the United States, or some other Western countries \u2013 overwhelming majority in the US \u2013 and that has reflected hugely on the nature of the country\u2019s sports; it\u2019s a paradigm shift.\n\nFor the first time in history, the world got to watch a Nigerian Olympic gymnast, in the person of 23-year-old Uche Eke. Dressed in a pair of fitting green Slimline Joggers, Eke wagged and wagged his legs to the administration of the scanty spectators at the Olympics arena, who could not help but clap for the young Nigerian.\n\nHe did not, however, go far in the games. He left almost as soon as he came, unable to compete with likes of the U.S., Russia, China, Japan and other nations that have been in the sport for ages. But it was a good debut, and part of the larger picture of the changing face of Nigerian sports, one driven by the Diaspora population.\n\nThere was 21-year-old Esther Tamaraebi Toko, the Canada based rowing sensation, and Abiola Ogunbanwo, coming from Australia to represent Nigeria in swimming; first, too, to represent the country in that category. But there is even the biggest of them all: basketball replaced football.\n\nIt\u2019s both heartwarming and sad story. On the one hand, the preponderance of foreign born or trained athletes speak eloquently to the strength of the country\u2019s Diaspora population, which can also be a catalyst for its development. But on the other hand, it lays bare the pathetic state of sports management in Nigeria, and how much things have deteriorated over the years.\n\nWhen in 1996, 50-year-old Chioma Ajunwa-Opara, jumped her way to gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, aged 25, becoming not just the first the Nigerian, but also the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal in a field event, she made a clear point; the point that the country had all it took \u2026 that with the necessary facilities and grooming, Nigerian athletes can rule the world.\n\nThe police officer who started life as a footballer, had subsequently opted for athletics when she was denied a chance to excel in the game by then Falcons coach who she said wouldn\u2019t just let her play, even when it was obvious that she was the best player in the team, later applied herself to track and field, specializing in the 100m, 200m and long jump, and by dint of hard work, won bronze medal at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, gold medal at the 1991 All Africa Games before taking gold at the Atlanta Olympics.\n\nThe same Atlanta games, Nigeria\u2019s under 23 Dream Team, comprised of young players who had grown up playing in Nigeria, with little to no European experience, beat both Brazil and Argentina en route to winning gold medal in the football event. 1996 turned out to be Nigeria\u2019s golden year. The Relay Team of Olabisi Afolabi, Fatima Yusuf, Charity Opara and Falilat Ogunkoya won the silver medal, while Mary Onyali and Ogunkoya took bronze in their individual track events. The medal table was capped by Duncan Dokiwari who also boxed his way to bronze, bringing to the number of medals won by Nigeria to five.\n\nBefore 1996, the country had only managed eight medals since it started participating in the games in 1952, five of which came from boxing and three from athletics. Indeed, the country won its first medal in the 1964 games held in Tokyo, with Nojim Maiyegun winning bronze in boxing. This was followed in West Germany 1972, by another bronze won in boxing by Isaac Ikhouria. And in 1984 in Los Angeles, Peter Konyegwachie won the country its first silver medal in boxing, a feat matched by the Relay Team of Sunday Uti, Moses Ugbisie, Rotimi Peters and Innocent Egbunike which took silver, too, in the track event.\n\nThe 1984 record was yet bettered by the 1992 athletes in Barcelona \u2013 after the 1988 team that went to Seoul, South Korea returned empty handed \u2013 with the Relay Team of Chidi Imo, Olapade Adeniken, Davidson Ezinwa and Oluyemi Kayode winning silver; David Izontitei and Igbinegbu each winning silver in boxing and the Relay Team of Mary Onyali, Christy Opara-Thompson, Beatrice Utundu and Faith Idehen winning bronze.\n\nSo, when the country amassed five medals four years later in 1996, it must have seemed as though this African giant was now emerging into a sports powerhouse, poised to challenge the likes of the United States, Russia and China. But things went rather downhill, slowly but surely, like everything else about \u201cthe African Giant.\u201d\n\nIn the following event in Sydney 2000, the country managed three medals; one gold medal, courtesy of the Relay Team of Nduka Awazie, Fidelis Gadzama, Clement Chukwu, Jude Monye, Sunday Bada and Enefiok Udo-Obong; as well as two silver medals one by sprinter, Gloria Alozie and weightlifter, Ruth Ogbeifo.\n\nFour years later, in Athens 2004, it came down to two bronze, won by the Relay Teams of Olusoji Fasuba, Uche Emedolu, Aaron Egbele and Deji Aliu; as well as James Godday, Musa Audu, Saul Weigopuwa and Enefiok Udo-Obong. This was slightly bettered in Beijing 2008 by the four medals won by the country\u2019s athletes, including two silver medals won by Blessing Okagbare and the Relay Team of Gloria Kemasuode, Franca Idoko, Halimat Ismaila, Oludamola Osayemi and Agnes Osazuwa. Chika Chukwumerije and Mariam Usman won bronze in taekwondo and weightlifting respectively.\n\nThe country failed to win any medals in London 2012, and only managed bronze in football at the Rio de Janerio games in 2016.\n\nOf the total 25 medals won by Nigeria since 1952, for instance, boxing accounted for six, athletics 13, football three, weightlifting two and taekwondo, one. But of the 60 athletes representing Nigeria in Tokyo, there is no single boxer, and no single footballer, as both the male and female Olympic football teams failed to qualify for the games.\n\nFootball has always been Nigeria\u2019s favourite sport, with Olympic gold, silver and bronze to show for it, but the badly managed local football leagues has ensured that no football team represents Nigeria in Tokyo. The country had eyed basketball for glory, a radical departure from the usual. While both the male and female football teams failed to qualify, the two basketball teams; D\u2019Tigers and D\u2019Tigress, made it to the games.\n\nUnlike the football teams that featured players born and raised in Nigeria, almost all the country\u2019s basketball players are either born or raised in the United States. Indeed with the exception of Ike Nwamu, who plays for Samara, Russia; Obi Emegano who plays for Fuenlabrada, Spain; Caleb Agada, who plays for Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva, Israel and Ekpe Udoh, who just completed a move Virtus Bologna in Italy, all other members of D\u2019Tigers squad, are based in the United States, and ply their trade in the NBA.\n\nThey include Josh Okogie (Minnesota Timberwolves), Miami Heat\u2019s trio of Gabe Vincent, KZ Okpala and Precious Achiuwa, Jahlil Okafor (Detroit Pistons) and Miye Oni (Utah Jazz), Jordan Nwora (Milwaukee Bucks) and Chimezie Metu (Sacramento Kings).\n\nNow, these are not Nigerians who simply went to the US or Europe to ply their trade. Most were born in the US, Canada or other western countries, or at least grew up there. It\u2019s same with the female basketball team, D\u2019Tigress. Only four of the 12 \u2013 Adara Elonu, Spain; Ify lbekwe, Italy; Ezinne Kalu, France; Aisha Mohammed, Kosovo; Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah, Italy; Atonye Nyingifa, Spain \u2013 are based in Europe, even as most were born in the states, where the rest \u2013 Promise Amukamara, Oderah Chidom, Erica Ogwumike, Nneka Ogwumike, Nnenna Amy Okonkwo and Elizabeth Olatayo Williams \u2013 ply their trade.\n\nThe athletics teams also saw a large contingent US born or trained athletes, including Chidi Okezie, Chioma Onyekwere, Favour Ofili, Ruth Usoro, Knowledge Omovoh, Tobi Amusan, Rosemary Chukwuma, among others. Nigerian sports is increasingly being driven by its Diaspora population. In a sense it\u2019s a crying shame that a country of over 200m people, cannot groom athletes that can compete for medals in the grandest stage of all. The hope of this ever happening, now increasingly lies with the Diaspora population, as sports like everything else, keep going downhill in Africa\u2019s most populous country.",

In the North West particularly, Nigeria is experiencing a crisis of armed banditry and kidnapping,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the region has remarkably witnessed five separate mass kidnapping incidents since November 2020, in which between tens and hundreds of children have been captured and carted away from public school premises.\n\n\u201cTheir negotiated release has cost the government as much as $2.4m, according to sources familiar with the details, although official sources insist that no ransoms were tendered.\n\n\u201cFor non-state armed groups, such payments will be used to sustain the war they have been waging against the state for over a decade.\u201d\n\nThe report also stated that the recurrent violence in different parts of the country had led to the destruction of property, agricultural losses, and human rights violations.\n\nCiting a report by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, it stated that Nigeria hosts 350 million or 70 per cent of the 500 million illegal arms in West Africa, noting that this further contributed to insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, wife of the Kebbi State Governor, Dr Aisha Bagudu, has decried the high level of school abductions in the country while also calling for public private partnership in tackling the menace, PUNCH reported.\n\nBagudu, who spoke during a press briefing to commemorate the World Literacy Day in Abuja on Monday, also called on well-meaning individuals to contribute to the eradication of mass illiteracy in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe rate of school abductions is high and very alarming and this makes us very sad. The truth is we are all sad about this.\n\n\u201cYou wonder if these people have children. The government alone cannot stop this. The host communities must come together to fight this.\u201d",

          "text": "A 14-year-old boy, Felix Adekunle, who was kidnapped on Monday, said he miraculously escaped from the den of his abductors a few hours after.\n\nFelix said he was kidnapped by some men, who were inside a Toyota Camry car with tinted glasses, while he was hawking slippers in the Okemapo area of Owo in the Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt happened on Monday while I was selling slippers after school hours. I decided to go to the market area to sell. I passed through Okemapo Road, which is a shorter route to the market. As I was going, I saw three men in a Toyota Camry car and they told me that one of my wares had fallen down.\n\n\u201cI quickly dropped the tray on my head to check, but I couldn\u2019t find anything. Suddenly, the men disembarked from the car and dragged me into the vehicle and I became unconscious.\n\n\u201cI later found myself in a dilapidated blue bungalow in a forest. I don\u2019t know the name of that area. Inside the building, I saw a woman crying with her hands tied to her back and I also saw the headless body of a young person.\n\n\u201cI asked the woman, who the headless person was and she responded that it was her child. At that moment, I was hearing the men\u2019s voices in another section of the house. The woman later told me to untie the rope from her hands and we fled together.\n\n\u201cWhile fleeing, the woman fell. She called me back and gave me N500 and said I should keep running and never look back. I heard gunshots from the house while I was escaping; I had to run faster.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the main road, I saw some people selling bread by the roadside and narrated my ordeal to them. They called the police, but there was no response; they later got in touch with the Amotekun Corps, who responded swiftly and took me to their office.\u201d\n\nThe mother of the victim, Mrs Abosede Adekunle, said she had been searching for her son when he did not return home on time, thinking that he had lost the sale proceeds.\n\nShe stated, \u201cBut later I received a call from the office of the Amotekun informing me that my boy was kidnapped but had been rescued.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to receive a call from Amotekun that I should come and pick my son, who was rescued from kidnapers. I thank the Ondo State Government for setting up the agency to take care of situations like this.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to their office, I met my son in good condition as the officers had fed him before my arrival.\u201d\n\nWhile handing Felix over to his mother at the headquarters in Akure, the Commander, Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Adeleye, said the command got a distress call that some vehicles drove recklessly along the Benin/Owo Expressway.\n\nAccording to him, while tracing the recklessly driven vehicles on the road, men of the corps saw the young boy on the road, who narrated his ordeal to them and he was immediately taken to the Amotekun office in Akure.\n\nAdeleye said, \u201cThe victim explained that the only thing he could remember was a Camry car without a number plate and with tinted glasses. He added that he became unconscious immediately he was pushed into the car.\n\n\u201cHe explained to us that the area, where he was kidnapped from, was isolated as he could not call on anyone. We took him away from the danger zone to our office, where he narrated his experience that three men tricked him that one of his wares had fallen off and dragged him into their vehicle and zoomed off to an unknown place and that he managed to escape from the place.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Abba Kyari, the embattled Deputy Commissioner of Police, has removed a post from his verified Facebook account after the Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed that money laundering suspect Abass Ramon, aka Hushpuppi, paid N8 million ($20,600) to a police officer to arrest and detain a \u201cco-conspirator,\u201d Chibuzo Vincent.\n\nKyari had published a defense against the charge of cooperation in a suspected $1.1 million fraud against a Qatari businessman on July 29, 2021, following his indictment last week, but he deleted the post last night as many Nigerians pointed out the logical flaws in his denial.\n\nThe United States District Court for the Central District of California had accused Kyari, Hushpuppi and four others of fleecing the Qatari investor of $1.1m.\n\nKyari, who has 447,353 followers on Facebook as of the time of filing this report, had taken to the Blueville on on July 29, 2021 to chronicle his denial against the allegations by the US court.\n\nKyari had claimed that Hushpuppi raised the alarm that Vincent wanted to take his life. The cop, however, said upon the arrest of Vincent, investigation showed that \u201cthey (Hushpuppi and Vincent) are long-time friends who have money issues between them hence we released the suspect on bail to go\u201d.\n\nThe cop had also added, \u201cNobody demanded a kobo from Abbas Hushpuppi. Our focus was to save people\u2019s lives that were purported to have been threatened.\n\n\u201cLater, he (Hushpuppi) saw some of my native clothes and caps on my social media page and he said he likes them and he was connected to the person selling the clothes and he sent about N300k (N300,000) directly to the person\u2019s account. The native clothes and caps (five sets) were brought to our office and He sent somebody to collect them in our office.\u201d\n\nHowever, FBI Special Agent, Andrew Innocenti, in a document titled, \u2018Criminal Complaint By Telephone Or Other Reliable Electronic Means\u2019 filed before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleged that Hushpuppi contracted the services of Kyari after Chibuzo allegedly threatened to expose the alleged $1.1m fraud committed against the Qatari businessman.\n\nPage 59, item 145 of the document dated February 12, 2021 which became public recently stated, \u201cKyari provided the account information for a bank account at a Nigerian bank, Zenith Bank, in the name of a person other than Kyari himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was not the only time that Abbas arranged payments with Kyari\u201d, adding, \u201cOn May 20, 2020, Abbas sent Kyari transaction receipts for two transactions from accounts at Nigerian banks (GTBank and Zenith Bank) of a person Abbas knew in the U.A.E.\u2014 a person also arrested with Abbas in Abbas\u2019 apartment in the U.A.E. by Dubai Police on June 9, 2020 \u2014 to the Nigerian bank accounts of another person in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe amounts on the transaction receipts totalled 8 million Nigerian Naira, which was approximately $20,600 based on publicly available exchange rate information,\u201d the FBI Agent added. A warrant of arrest has since been issued by the court against Kyari.\n\nKyari subsequently deleted his \u201cN300,000\u201d Facebook post after Innocenti\u2019s accusation became public. He also deleted a third-party post authored by a former minister in his defence.\n\nKyari\u2019s post had attracted a lot of scrutiny from thousands of his social media followers and many Nigerians who expressed disappointment in the conduct of the detective and \u201ccelebrated cop\u201d.\n\nIt was earlier reported that Kyari, the suspended former Head of the Intelligence Response Team, appeared before the Special Investigation Panel, headed by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in-charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department, Joseph Egbunike.\n\nKyari, presented his defence to the SIP at the Force headquarters, Abuja, on Tuesday. The panel constituted by Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, is expected to probe Kyari and submit its findings to the IGP.\n\nAlso, the new Head of the Intelligence Response Team, Tunji Disu, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, resumed at the Guzape, Abuja headquarters of the unit on Tuesday.",

The SDR is defined by the US dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and the British Pound.\n\nSupporting Pandemic Recovery\n\nThe amount allocated to Nigeria is as a result of the exchange rate of reference which is 0.702283 SDR to a dollar as of July 1, 2021, and Nigeria has 2.4545 billion SDRs.\n\n\u201cThe SDR allocation will benefit all members, address the long-term global need for reserves, build confidence, and foster the resilience and stability of the global economy,\u201d the IMF managing director added.\n\n\u201cIt will particularly help our most vulnerable countries struggling to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IMF, the general allocation of SDRs will become effective on August 23 and the newly created SDRs will be credited to IMF member countries in proportion to their existing quotas in the Fund.\n\nIt stated that about $275 billion (about SDR 193 billion) of the new allocation will go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nGeorgieva promised that the fund would continue to engage actively with its membership to identify viable options for voluntary channelling of SDRs from wealthier to poorer, and more vulnerable member countries to support their pandemic recovery and achieve resilient and sustainable growth.\n\nOne key option is for members that have strong external positions to voluntarily channel part of their SDRs to scale up lending for low-income countries through the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\n\nThe IMF said the concessional support through the PRGT was currently interest-free, adding that it was exploring other options to help poorer and more vulnerable countries in their recovery efforts.\n\nA new Resilience and Sustainability Trust could be considered to facilitate more resilient and sustainable growth in the medium term, it stated.",

          "title": "Biden Chides Republican Governors Who Resist Vaccine Rules",
          "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday called on resistant Republican governors to \u201cget out of the way\u201d of vaccine rules aimed at containing the more transmissible and dangerous COVID-19 variant. He backed city and private mandates requiring people to be vaccinated to go about some daily activities.\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Biden sharply criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and other officials who have moved to block the reimposition of mask mandates to slow the delta strain of the virus. The strain is surging in their states and other parts of the country that have large numbers of unvaccinated people.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to help, at least get out of the way of people trying to do the right thing,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden endorsed New York City\u2019s move to require vaccinations to dine indoors or go to the gym, as well as corporate moves to require vaccines to return to work, and said more localities and businesses should follow suit. Such policies have been barred to varying degrees in at least seven GOP-led states.\n\nA rise in infections in the U.S., fueled by the highly contagious delta strain of the virus, led U.S. public health officials last week to recommend that even people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 resume wearing face coverings in some public indoor settings.\n\nAfter months of dangling carrots of incentive to Americans to get vaccinated \u2014 including million- dollar cash lotteries and opportunities to earn free college tuition \u2014 the Biden administration is looking to wield a stick by making it harder for people to remain unvaccinated without seeing their daily lives disrupted.\n\nAs he seeks to drive up vaccinations at home, Biden is also spotlighting his administration\u2019s progress in sharing shots with the rest of the world \u2014 an initiative helped in part by the slowed pace of domestic vaccination that has increased the nation\u2019s stockpile of doses. Roughly 90 million eligible Americans aged 12 and over have yet to receive one dose of vaccine.\n\nBiden announced that the U.S. has donated and shipped more than 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 60 countries, ranging from Afghanistan to Zambia.\n\n\u201cVaccinate America and help vaccinate the world,\u201d Biden said, \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to beat this thing.\u201d\n\nBiden has promised that the U.S. will be the \u201carsenal of vaccines\u201d for the world, but while notable, the 110 million doses the U.S. has donated largely through a global vaccine program known as COVAX represent a fraction of what is needed worldwide.\n\nThe White House said in a statement Tuesday that U.S. at the end of August will begin shipping 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccine that it has pledged to 100 low-income countries by June 2022.\n\nBiden had pledged to ship more than 80 million doses overseas by the end of June, but had only been able to share a fraction of that due to logistical and regulatory hurdles in recipient countries.\n\nThe pace of shipments picked up significantly through July.\n\nUnder Biden\u2019s sharing plan, about 75% of U.S. doses are shared through COVAX, which aims to help lower- and middle-income nations, with the balance being sent to U.S. partners and allies.\n\nThe White House insists that nothing is being sought in return for the shots, contrasting its approach to Russia and China, which it alleges have used access to their domestically produced vaccines as a tool of geopolitical leverage.",
