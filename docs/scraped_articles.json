          "text": "By Emma Ujah & Peter Egwuatu\n\nThe federal government has in troduced an excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nZainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, disclosed this during the public presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Act yesterday in Abuja.\n\nExcise duty is a form of tax imposed on the locally manufactured goods.\n\nThe new policy, now referred as \u2018Sugar Tax\u2019, is contained in the Finance Act signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021.\n\nAhmed said the 2021 Finance Act also raised excise duties and revenues for the health sector.\n\nThe Minister said the excise duty on soft drinks would discourage excessive consumption of sugar beverages which contributes to diabetes, obesity among others.\n\nShe stated: \u201cThere\u2019s now an excise duty of N10/ per litre imposed on all non-alcoholic and sweetened beverages; And this is to discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages which contributes to a number of health conditions including diabetes and obesity.\n\n\u201cBut it is also used to revenues for health-related and other critical expenditures. This is in line with the 2022 budget priorities.\u201d\n\nOn December 14, 2021, the Organised Private Sector, OPS, notified its rejection of the plans by government to reintroduce excise duty on carbonated drinks.\n\nCommunicating the position of the OPS, the Chairman, Mr Taiwo Adeniyi, stated: \u201cIt is instructive to note that Nigerian manufacturers have been contending with the dislocations caused by the pandemic and the recession that followed; they are also facing serious crisis resulting from liquidity challenges in the foreign exchange market, which is impacting adversely on the cost of production; in addition, they are faced with intense pressure arising from numerous structural bottlenecks that are creating sustainability challenges for investors, especially those in the SME segment.\n\nAlso of concern is significant spike in the cost of raw materials, cost of fund, high import duty, elevated energy cost, prohibitive cost of transportation and high cost of logistics/shipping.\n\n\u201cWe therefore, urge Government to jettison the idea of reintroducing the Excise Duty on carbonated drinks but continue to support and promote the industry to attain full recovery after the onslaught of the pandemic and position it to further accommodate the teeming unemployed Nigerian, particularly the youths.\u201d\n\nAlso president of the National Union of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Employees, NUFBTE , Union, Mr. Lateef Oyelekan, stated that: \u201cShould this excise duty be imposed these companies would have no choice than to lay off workers.\n\n\u201cSome may have to reduce production line instead of expansion, while some may even close down permanently. It has happened in the past. At the end, Nigerians are the ones that will suffer.\n\n\u201cThese companies are already looking outside Nigeria for alternate production of their products and would rather move to a more favourable business climate in the West Africa region.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "How to stop hustling and start positioning for wealth",
          "text": "Agada\n\nThe word positioning means to be well placed in a path of opportunity, ready and able to harvest, extract, and leverage opportunities when they show up. This means that positioning that creates wealth involves three things \u2013 a path where opportunities flow, your position on that path and your ability to extract and leverage opportunities when they show up on the path.\n\nFor positioning to work for you something of value must be flowing your way. Commonly, one of the resources that flow our way is money. Money is in constant circulation because the moment money enters your hand it is ready to leave either for investment that would return or permanently lost to consumption expenditure.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nWhen it leaves it enters the central money circulation system ready to be extracted by someone else that is well positioned for it. When it stays it remains with you as savings until you decide whetherto invest it or lose it. Thus, if you spend 90% of your income every month on expenses, you are losing 90% of your money back into circulation.\n\nWhile we all must lose money back into circulation to keep life going, money lost into circulation does not make you rich. It is money harvested from circulation, saved, and well invested that leads to your own freedom. Thus, unless your money harvesting abilities exceed your money losing abilities you will not achieve financial freedom. When you contribute money into the system more than you harvest you are hustling. But when you harvest more money than you contribute you are positioning.\n\nSo, what is the difference between hustling and positioning for wealth?\n\nHustling and Positioning\n\nHustling is the constant grind of pursuing money because you are losing more money back into circulation than you are getting out of it. Positioning is being in the path of opportunity flow and having a system to harvest more money than you lose.\n\nImagine, for example, that I give you the task to catch 1000 butterflies. Butterflies are a species of animals that are in constant motion just like money. So, let\u2019s see the different ways you can achieve your goal. Your first strategy may be to catch the butterflies by hand. To do this you will have to pursue them one after another. Yet, butterflies have an advantage that you do not have \u2013 they can fly and are faster moving than you. Thus, if you choose this strategy, you will wear yourself out by the time you could catch only 100 of them. This is what hustling looks like, and what 80% of working professionals are doing. They are pursuing a fast-paced moving item \u2013 money, wasting time, and catching only a few.\n\nOk, let\u2019s look at another strategy that you may use. Perhaps you decide to use a net instead. This strategy will help you catch more butterflies, but the method is still the same. You will have to pursue the butterflies and maybe you could catch 500.\n\nBut what if you decide to hire 100 people to each catch 10 butterflies instead? This looks like a better strategy. However, the people will still have to chase around the butterflies. At the end of the day, you may achieve your goal, but you will be adding cost and stress to the equation.\n\nSo, what then is the best strategy?\n\nThe best strategy is to position and not pursue. Whenever you are dealing with something that has the advantage of speed more than you, the best strategy is not to pursue it. Pursuing will always keep the object ahead of you. The best strategy is to go ahead of it and position in front of it for an easy catch. When you position you can achieve your goals faster, with little time, workload, and cost.\n\nSo, how do you catch your 1000 butterflies?\n\nYou need to first answer the question, what do butterflies want or love? Butterflies love flowers and are attracted to beautiful gardens. Adult butterflies get their energy from nectar contained in the flowers in a garden. Thus, rather than pursue butterflies you simply focus on building a beautiful garden and then position the garden where they can never miss it. Once the garden is set, all you must do is set a trap for the catch and then take a seat, grab a cup of coffee, and see your 1000 butterflies flow into your trap on their own accord. This seems to be what the wealthy people are doing and it is also why hustlers can never be successful.\n\nSo, if positioning is the answer, how do you position for wealth?\n\nFocus on People.\n\nPeople are the means through which money moves. Money does not have legs, so the only way money moves is through people. This means that you must do something for the people that already have the money to get it. And the only thing that will allow them to give you their money is when you solve a problem for them.\n\nProblem solvers are also known as business owners and they are the wealthiest people in the world. Without the ability to solve problems, especially high-income ones you cannot increase your income or achieve financial freedom.\n\nThe more measurable, specific, and unique the problem you solve the more money you will make. People are the real wealth in circulation, and not money. And they are also the real answers to your money problem. The truth is all the money you want and will ever need is already in the hands of somebody else. But the only way to get it is to solve a problem for them. Thus, the more people you can solve problems for, the more money you will make.\n\nSadly, employees are stuck with one employer, and until you can solve problems for other employers outside your main employer, your chances of achieving financial freedom is slim.\n\nChoose a proven path to wealth\n\nTo create wealth, you must choose a path where wealth is already circulating as not all paths lead to wealth. Some paths can only help you get by. For example, the path of a teacher is different from the path of an entrepreneur. While the entrepreneur\u2019s path has been proven to produce many millionaires, the teacher\u2019s path has no such capacities. Thus, the path you choose is important as far as wealth is concerned.\n\nAlso, within a path not all places and positions are profitable. For example, research shows that 70% of businesses die after the first five years even though they are on a proven wealth path. This means that you must choose a profitable position and place for success to happen within a path.\n\nSo how do you position in a given path?\n\nThe first thing to do is to choose a unique position. Your position on a path is what differentiates you from others in the same path. You must be unique and different to stand out.\n\nThe second thing you must do is to choose a unique place. Your place in a path is the unique category you have carved out for yourself. For example, Apple is in the phone niche market. But the design of Apple phones and its features puts it in a different category from its competitors.\n\nThe third thing is your solution \u2013 that is the uniqueness of how you solve the problem. If people are going to give you any money, you must solve the problem in a unique way.\n\nCreate your own wealth garden\n\nTo position and not pursue wealth you must create your own wealth garden. A wealth garden is a center of resources that benefits and attracts other people. To create your own wealth garden, you need to do three things.\n\nThe first is to develop a strong personal brand. Money does not flow to you when you are a Nobody. Money flows to you when you have built a name. Who are you and what would we find when we Google your name? If your name does not ring a bell you would struggle to create wealth or extract maximum wealth from the system.\n\nThe second thing you must do is own and control valuable assets. If people are going to come to you, they will come because you have certain assets that they can benefit from, leverage on, use, buy, borrow or share. When you own and control valuable assets you become a natural magnet for the people that need those assets.\n\nThe third thing you must do is to have valuable relational capital. Relational capital is the ability to pull people, firms, or institutions together for wealth creation purposes. Since money flows through people, the more people, capacities, and resources you can pull together for mutual benefit, the larger the wealth you will create.\n\nBut how do you do all these you may ask?\n\nThe simple answer I can give you is to focus on the part of you that can give you the greatest wealth leverage. There are three parts of you \u2013 the physical you, the mental you and the spiritual you.\n\nTo create maximum wealth, you must focus on developing your mental capacities (Creativity and Skills) and spiritual capacities (Identity and Alignment of Purpose) more than you do your physical energy. Hustling simply means that your physical body is doing most of the work and this is the fastest way to end up with a pile of medical bills in retirement.\n\nTo create wealth and preserve your health at the same time, you must focus on working your mental and spiritual energy more than your physical energy.

          "text": "The year 2021 ended with many challenges in the education sector that have spilled over into the New Year. KOFOWOROLA BELO-OSAGIE and DAMOLA KOLA-DARE report on how they are being tackled by stakeholders.\n\nSchools abductions threatened education\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that the Nigerian education sector faced last year was the abduction of children from schools.\n\nLast month, the United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF) reported that 1,440 children were abducted in 25 attacks on schools by bandits. The figure is hundreds more than the number of children abducted in seven years.\n\nThe number of attacks not only significantly increased but spread from Borno, Yobe and Katsina states, where the most notable attacks started to Niger, Sokoto, Jigawa, Zamfara and Kaduna states where many children are still in captivity.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nProminent among the mass school abductions in 2021 were: Bethel Baptist High School, Kaduna, where 121 pupils were abducted on July 5 and were released in batches until January 1. The bandits demanded N180 million from the parents. One pupil remains in captivity.\n\nOther school abductions that made headlines were: 73 pupils kidnapped form Government Day Secondary School in Kaya, Zamfara state (September 1); 15 students kidnapped from College of Agriculture, Zamfara (August 16); an undetermined number of pupils were abducted from the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri (June 17); 29 students of Greenfield University Kaduna kidnapped on April 18. Five of the students were killed.\n\nThe attacks led to school closures in the northern part of Nigeria. In September, many states, like Kaduna and Niger, did not resume on schedule for the 2020/2021 academic session. Some states operated partial resumption \u2013 closing schools in insecure areas and relocating the children to schools in more secure neighbourhoods.\n\nHowever, many Civil Society Organisations reported that even where schools were open, parents did not allow their wards to attend for fear of being kidnapped.\n\nAbdulGaniu Abubakar, who runs a CSO in Sokoto, said of the development: \u201cParents do not want to send their children back to school. Education in Zamfara, Sokoto and Niger states has been crippled for good three years.\u201d\n\nThe School Safety Declaration signed by Nigeria and over 100 other countries last October when Nigeria hosted the International Safe School Conference in Abuja commits the country to addressing issues that make schools unsafe.\n\nLast December, the development Research and Project Centre (dRPC) trained representatives of 36 CSOs across the country to implement the Safe School Declaration.\n\nThe Safe School Manual used for the training has five modules that covers: Minimum Standards for Safe Schools; rights of a child; violence in school settings and other non-formal environment, safeguarding of learners against violence and abuse, roles of teachers and SBMCs in child safeguarding; mandatory reporting of cases of abuse and violence against learners; and continuing education during armed conflict, among others.\n\nNational Coordinator, Education in Emergency Working Group (EIEWG), Dr. Judith Giwa-Amu, said it was important to train CSOs since they are at the grassroots and front liners who can support the government to run with the vision across the country.\n\nAs follow up, the Executive Director of dRPC, Dr. Judith-Ann Walker said the centre would cover more ground this year by training School Based Management Committtees to respond to school safety issues in 10 states with funding from the Ford Foundation.\n\nShe said: \u201cFor the new year the dRPC will building on the recommendations of the Step-down workshop to strengthening the capacity of 40 School Based Management Committees (SBMC) and community based associations (CBOs) supporting Girls\u2019 Education in 10 states to help them to document the incidence of school attacks; and to trace and report on the impact of the attacks for enrollment, transition and retention of girls in particular; on educational outcomes; attitudes to school-based formal education in the community; and on the capacity of these CBOs and SBMCs to innovative by introducing and supporting new forms of safe spaces for girls\u2019 education.\u201d\n\nThe Safe School Declaration recommends increased funding for education in conflict areas; de-militarisation of schools; and sensitisation of military to strengthen child protection, among others.\n\nFed Govt, ASUU: An unending battle\n\nThe cat and mouse relationship between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Federal Government played out prominently last year. The union spent most of the year threatening to resume strike over the failure of the Federal Government to meet its demands on the 2009 ASUU/FGN Agreement. The demands included injecting some N1.3 billion to revitalise facilities in public universities; the adoption of the University Transparency Accountability Solutions (UTAS) created by the union to replace the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) as payment platform; and payment of earned academic allowances, among others.\n\nThe government\u2019s promise to fulfill the demands was what prompted the union to suspend its nine-month strike last year on December 23.\n\nFollowing the strike, the Federal Government released N65 billion early last year.\n\nLabour Minister Chris Ngige said the money \u201cwas proposed to be shared in two different manners. First, a proposal for N25 billion revitalisation and N40 billion earned allowances for all the unions in the universities.\u201d\n\nThe second proposal, according to him, was \u201cthe issue of revitalisation getting N30 billion and earned allowances getting N35 billion.\u201d\n\nHowever, after that time the union accused the government of failing to fulfill its promise, while government accused the union of forcing its hand to meet their demands.\n\nFinally, on December 10, government released additional N52.5 billion for revitalisation and earned allowances.\n\nASUU condemned the piece-meal release of funds with the national ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke saying the union was ready to go back to the trenches following government\u2019s failure to replace IPPIS with UTAS, revitalize universities and renegotiate the 2009 Agreement.\n\nIn a chat with The Nation, ASUU Chairman, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr. Dele Ashiru, said for the union to stop going on strike, government must fulfill all agreements, particularly the 2009 renegotiated agreement.\n\nHe said: \u201cAn agreement was signed in 2009 with four principal components, condition of service,funding for revitalisation of public universities, university autonomy and academic freedom, among others. More than 12 years after that agreement, government has implemented the agreement in breach.\n\n\u201cThe agreement was renegotiated in May (2021), between that time and today, government has refused to sign the agreement. In fact, it is the bone of contention between our union and Federal Government. If it is not signed, the conditions of service of our members which includes salaries will not have changed in the last 12 years.\n\n\u201cGovernment must as a matter of urgency, commence the implementation of the renegotiated agreement.\u201d\n\nOn the approval of UTAS by the Federal Government, Ashiru noted that the union would not accept \u201cmere pronouncement\u201d, until lecturers\u2019 salaries were paid through the platform.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing on pages of newspapers that government has approved UTAS, but for our members, it is a mere pronouncement. We will not accept that UTAS has been approved, it is until our salaries are paid through it,\u201d he said.\n\nAshiru said the union would embark on strike if interventions from well-meaning Nigerians including the Nigerian Interreligious Council do not yield positive results.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur union is waiting for the interventions. If those interventions are not positive, our union would have no choice but to resume our suspended strike. Our union in its characteristic manner is only tarrying a little to see if government would yield to the voice of reason.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, a large proportion of academia in the country is yet to receive December salary.\n\n\u201dHowever, between now and our next meeting (early January), our union will review the situation and take appropriate actions.\u201d\n\nDeath by bullying\n\nThe death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, a JSS2 pupil of Dowen College, Lekki last November 31, as a result of injuries sustained from bullying came as a shock to Nigerians.\n\nThe incidents that led to Oromoni\u2019s death are being investigated by the Nigeria Police and the Lagos State Government, which shut the boarding school on December 3.\n\nAccording to an autopsy report by a consultant pathologist at the Central Hospital Warri, Clement Vhriterhire, Oromoni died due to \u201cacute lung injury due to chemical intoxication in a background of blunt force trauma.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu expressed interest in the case, saying the culprits would be punished accordingly.\n\nThe case ignited an anti-bullying campaign across the country \u2013 with experts, professional groups and schools coming up with programmes aimed at addressing bullying.\n\nWhile the Child Protection Network (CPN) called for implementation of child protection policies in schools; the Association of Professional Counsellors in Nigeria (APROCON), Lagos chapter urged the Lagos State Government to mandate all private schools to engage full-time counsellors.\n\nThe case also got prominent attention during a training for Civil Society Organisations in Abuja early this month, to implement the Safe School Declaration as bullying was identified as part of violence that makes the school environment unsafe for pupils.\n\nAs schools resumed in Lagos for the second term of the 2021/2022 academic session on Tuesday, the Education Commissioner, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo directed schools to implement safeguarding measures against bullying and other threats.\n\nIn an interview with The Nation, Mrs. Adefisayo said schools should monitor pupils more and check negative behaviour.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that schools do everything, have zero tolerance. Just put in as many procedures in place to prevent bad incidents happening.\n\n\u201cThere are many things that any school can do. Any case that comes, you immediately treat it with dispatch and then, you keep watch over the students. Keep watching them. You will see the one that are unhappy and teachers should stay close to their students so you can see the change in behavior and so. They are so many things the School can do. And that\u2019s what we are counselling them,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Oromoni\u2019s death, experts have recommended how victims of bullying can be helped.\n\nA Clinical Psychologist at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Oyo State, Dr. Oluwafisayo Adebimpe, said bullying could be overcome through psychological treatments.\n\nAccording to her, the individual would go through sessions for specific periods of time \u2013 up to 16 weeks \u2013 and areas of inadequacies are targeted.\n\nShe stated that some go through Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Assertive Therapy, Behaviour therapy/ Behaviour modifications.\n\nShe said treatment would focus on how the self-esteem and self-confidence are reactivated.\n\n\u201cSome victims would also have to go through cognitive restructuring and cognitive challenge. There is a need to denounce the false and erroneous beliefs/perception of the negatives feedbacks they went through in the hands of those who bullied them.\u201d",
          "summary": "Schools abductions threatened educationOne of the biggest challenges that the Nigerian education sector faced last year was the abduction of children from schools.\nLast month, the United Nations Children Education Fund (UNICEF) reported that 1,440 children were abducted in 25 attacks on schools by bandits.\nSome states operated partial resumption \u2013 closing schools in insecure areas and relocating the children to schools in more secure neighbourhoods.\nLast December, the development Research and Project Centre (dRPC) trained representatives of 36 CSOs across the country to implement the Safe School Declaration.\nThe case also got prominent attention during a training for Civil Society Organisations in Abuja early this month, to implement the Safe School Declaration as bullying was identified as part of violence that makes the school environment unsafe for pupils.",

          "text": "Ten of the 11 members of the Olubadan-in-Council on Wednesday endorsed the nomination of Senator Lekan Balogun as the next Olubadan of Ibadanland.\n\nThe Council also denied that a legal tussle could scupper the succession to the Olubadan throne.\n\nHere are things to know about the new Olubadan-elect of Ibadanland, the 79-year-old Dr Lekan Balogun\n\n\u00b7 After his primary school education, young Lekan was enrolled at CAC Modern School, Anlugbua. Then he was staying with one of his brothers, Late Hamzat Adewale Balogun, who was a civil servant but was studying privately for the General Certificate of Education, Ordinary Level (GCE O\u2019L). He was also subscribing to Rapid Result College in the UK to enhance his performance in the examination. But Lekan was secretly reading his brother\u2019s correspondence which became very helpful to him when he wrote his qualifying test which was like \u2018G4\u2019 at the time.\n\nWhile in the second year of the three-year modern school programme, Lekan sat for the Qualifying Examination and passed. Therefore, he left school without completing the programme.\n\n\u00b7 For his undergraduate programme, he enjoyed university scholarship while his post-graduate studies were sponsored by the Social Science Research Council. He returned to Nigeria and took up an appointment with Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u00b7 He travelled to the UK where he studied for his O and A levels certificates while doing a part-time job to sustain himself- all under 18 years of age. A highly cerebral student, gaining admission into the university was not a problem for him. In fact, he had the task of choosing from many offers after which he settled for Brunel University. He left the university in 1973 with a Masters degree in Administration and Economics.\n\n\u00b7 He holds a Doctorate, Master\u2019s and Bachelor\u2019s Degrees in Public Administration; Public and Social Administration and Economics from Columbus International University, Brunel University and Manchester University all in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u00b7 He was once a Research Fellow with the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria; a Director with Triumph Newspaper, Kano; Editor of the monthly Magazine \u2013 \u201cThe Nigerian Pathfinder\u201d as well as Management Consultant for Multinational Organizations such as Leyland, Exiat Battery and Nigerian Breweries. He\u2019s a renowned technocrat, author and philanthropist.\n\n\u00b7 Senator Lekan Balogun sits on the Board of several companies with interests in Oil and Gas, Distributive Trade, Management Consulting, Mechanized Farming and Export of non-oil items as well as Travels and Tourism. Erstwhile Administrator/Head, Industrial Relations, Recruitment and Scholarships, Planning and Development at Shell Petroleum Development Company.\n\n\u00b7 He was a former Presidential Aspirant on the platform of SDP. Senator Balogun was also a Gubernatorial Candidate for the PDP in Oyo State in the present political dispensation and a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the Fourth Republic. He was chairman Senate Committee on National Planning and was a member to many Senate committees such as Appropriations, Security and Intelligence, Police Affairs and Defence (Army).\n\n\u00b7 He has written and published widely. Many of his publications include but not limited to; A Review of Nigeria\u2019s 4 years\u2019 Development Plan, 1970-1974; Nigeria: Social Justice or Doom; Power for Sale: published in ; Arrogance of Power; Nigeria.\n\n\u00b7 He had a stint with the Lamberth Local Government Social Services Department where he worked for one and a half years after which his academic inclination took the better of him and he enrolled for his PhD. Lekan\u2019s outstanding academic performance did not go unnoticed.\n\n\u00b7 In 1973, he resumed as a research fellow at ABU Centre for Social and Economic Research. He also had the option of working as a lecturer at the University of Ife now Obafemi Awolowo University but he chose ABU instead because of the desire to relate with other people away from his birth place and to know their cultures and traditions. Young and energetic, it did not take him long to tender his resignation letter at ABU Having been employed as a positive research fellow to write papers for the government and highlight how well it was doing instead of normative research whereby he would be engaged in writing what government ought to do, he felt the idea of \u201c praise singing\u201d government\u2019s programmes negated his ideological principle which is of the progressive-leaning.\n\n\u00b7 He later took up an appointment with Shell British Petroleum Company where he had a very flourishing career and got promoted almost every year until he became the Head of Recruitment. This bright prospect notwithstanding, Lekan didn\u2019t stay too long in the company. Again, his ideological conviction was being challenged. His job, he thought, was not in consonance with his beliefs. He was no longer comfortable with a situation whereby as a member of management, he was saying \u2018no\u2019 to most of the workers\u2019 demands and using his intellectual prowess to deny workers of what he considered to be their rights. In a book: The Portrait of an Activist, a biography of Lekan Balogun, it was recorded that \u201cby working against Nigerian workers, those he was supposed to be championing their cause was simply against his conscience and not minding the prospects of his reaching the zenith in the company, he abruptly called it quits. \u201d\n\n\u00b7 In the UK, he developed the white-black consciousness which crystallised into activism and the struggle for human rights. To give vent to his passion, he joined the leftist Marxist movement. Thus, he not only rejected the racist tendencies of the White but racism \u2013 whether it was black or white because he was aware that though everyone in his country was black, yet some black people were oppressors of their fellow blacks. He plunged into the murky waters of politics in 1978 when he joined the PRP of late Aminu Kano.\n\n\u00b7 His charisma, honesty and gallantry soon saw him climbing the political ladder with ease and grace that eventually accorded him the respect and recognition of the political overlords of Oyo State. Within a short period, he had made his mark as an astute politician, activist and champion of downtrodden masses. He later became the gubernatorial candidate of one of the major political parties in the country, the Nigerian People\u2019s Party (NPP) of Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\n\u00b7 The military coup of December 1983 kept him and other political giants in the cooler for 16 years. He later re-emerged on the political scene with his election as a distinguished senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1999.\n\n\u00b7 As Senator Lekan Balogun rose in politics, he continued to rise in the traditional hierarchy of Ibadanland, culminating in his present position as the Olubadan elect of Ibadanland.\n\n\u00b7 His younger brother, Senator Kola Balogun is the Senator representing Oyo South Senatorial district.",

On behalf of my family , the executive council I want to thank you for this special visit, Hon Dan concluded\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, Ward Councillor,Hon.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has again rejected the call for state police as solution to the nation\u2019s mounting security challenges.\n\nThe agitation has led to the setting up of regional security outfits by some state governments. But despite the mounting pressure from several quarters, President Buhari said state police is not an option.\n\nHe challenged Nigerians to question why governors, who are in the forefront of the clamour for state police, have not given powers to local governments.\n\n\u201cState police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local governments and the governors. Are the third tier of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Let the people in the local governments tell you the truth \u2014 the fight between local governments and the governor.\u201d\n\nHe suggested a bigger role for traditional rulers in bringing peace to communities stating that the royal fathers know who is who in their localities.\n\n\u201cThe role of traditional rulers must not be undermined, because in their areas they know who is who, even by families, not to even talk of individuals. So, we have to revert to that system for us to have effective security in the localities.\u201d\n\n\u2022Kanu: I\u2019ll not interfere with judiciary\n\nHe dismissed the option of a political solution for the release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). He insisted that his case is with the judiciary and that he would never interfere with the judicial processes.\n\nIn November 2021, South-East traditional and religious leaders had asked the president to grant amnesty to Kanu to deescalate tension in the zone.\n\nKanu was arrested abroad and returned to Nigeria after he jumped bail and fled the country in 2017. He is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him in response to years of the campaign for the Republic of Biafra through IPOB.\n\nCommenting on the trial of the IPOB leader during the interview, the president said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare interfere with the judiciary. No. We cannot rule out possibility of political solution, but if he will behave himself all well and good. But you can\u2019t go to a foreign country and keep on sending incorrect economic and security problem against your country and thinking that you will never have to account for what you have been doing. Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nKanu is in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nA federal high court sitting in Abuja has adjourned his trial till January 19.\n\n\u2022My grouse with direct primaries\n\nHe said blamed lawmakers for attempting to restrict the choice of political parties by allowing only direst primary and vowed to sign the bill on if indirect primary and consensus are also made options.\n\n\u201cAll I said (is that) there should be options. We must not insist that it has to be direct; it should be consensus and indirect. I want people to be given a choice. You can\u2019t give them one option, and you think that you are being democratic? Let them have the three options of direct, indirect and consensus.\n\n\u2022I\u2019m not interested in who succeeds me\n\nPresident Buhari declined to speak on his successor, when asked if he had a preference and would want to mention names. He said: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t because he will be eliminated if I mention it. I better keep it a secret. 2023 is not my problem. I am not interested in who succeeds me. I don\u2019t have any favourite.\u201d\n\n\u2022Herders, farmers clashes\n\nHe blamed herders, farmers clashes on locals along grazing routes. He explained: \u201cFor example, there were two governors that came to see me about problems \u2013 Oyo State and one other state \u2013 because the herders were in their forests but the animals were going into the neighbouring farms, and eating the crops; I said, as far as I know, the farmers and herders have been co-existing in Nigeria for generations. Let them go and ask the local leadership what has gone wrong, why the break in communication between the local leadership and the herders.\u201d\n\n\u2022We made successes in fight against banditry\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOn the issue of bandits in the North West, the president said the administration has already taken steps to deal with the bandits and criminals as well as treat them as terrorists.\n\n\u201cI think the only language they understand, we have discussed it thoroughly with the law enforcement agencies; the security chiefs, the Inspector General of Police \u2013 is to go after them; the terrorists. We labelled them terrorists, and we are going to deal with them as such.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said there have been successes in the fight against banditry in the region.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe if you go to those constituencies in the North West and North Central in the last four weeks there are improvements in the security.\u201d\n\n\u2022Power privatisation not done on merit\n\nHe decried the state of power in the country and noted that no country can develop without solid infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI am not happy with the state of power because no country can develop without infrastructure and infrastructure means road, rail and power.\n\n\u201cThis government is working very hard on the road. Try to imagine what was happening between Lagos to Ibadan six months ago and what it is now.\n\n\u201cWe are doing from Lagos to Kano the rail, road from here to Kaduna to Kano. So we have to get the infrastructure right and then Nigerians will mind their own business. But when the infrastructure is not there, the roads are not there, the rail is virtually killed, no power, what do we expect people to do?\u201d\n\nHe said power is still epileptic because the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is 100 per cent government-owned and noted that his government inherited the Distribution Companies (DisCos).\n\nHe also lamented that owners of Discos bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit.\n\n\u201cThe people that own them, who are they? They are not electrical engineers, they don\u2019t have money, it is just a political favour. We thought that was unnecessary. To remove a system and reintroduce one is no joke. Luckily we have the TCN and that is the transmission. If we can get our technology right, we will cut the cost on transmission and the likelihood of sabotaging the lines and so on.\n\n\u201cI told you now we have something. I\u2019m sure you know, what it used to be between Lagos and Ibadan alone not to talk about the rest of the country. But we\u2019ve got the Chinese to have the rail, to do the roads. How can we turn that down? So the Chinese are welcome. Anybody that is prepared to come and help with our infrastructure, I have told you the roads, the rail and power will be welcome.\u201d\n\n\u2022Don\u2019t expect automatic employment\n\nOn youths, Buhari said young Nigerian undergraduates should not expect automatic employment after graduation.\n\nHe challenges them to also look in the direction of agriculture.\n\n\u201cI wish when they go to school; when they work hard; when they earn their degree, they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs. You get educated because an educated person is certainly better than an uneducated person even in identifying personal problems. So, education is not meant just meant to hang on to government to give you jobs and then what the colonialists indoctrinated in us to believe \u2013 have a car, have a house; start work by 8am and close by 2pm.\u201d\n\nHe had just one word for the main opposition party: \u201cPDP failure.\u201d\n\n\u2022On legacy\n\nAsked what legacy he would be leaving behind he answered: \u201cMy legacy is that I have tried for us to conduct ourselves with integrity. We have stopped stealing, misappropriation.\u201d",

The utter disrespect, which underlines the response of the officer to the Governor establishes, beyond doubt, the impracticability of the current system, dubiously christened \u2018Federalism.\u2019\n\n\u201cAn arrangement, which compelled the Governor of a state to seek clarification on security issues in his jurisdiction from totally extraneous bodies or persons is a sure recipe for anarchy.\n\n\u201cWe condemn, very strongly, this brazen assault on decency. We call on the Inspector-General of Police to explain the justification for this intrusion.\n\n\u201cThis is not acceptable. Any expectations of rapprochement between so-called federating units and federal security agencies are becoming forlorn, progressively, due to deliberate acts, which mock our very avowal to ethics and professionalism. We condemn in very clear terms the role of the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami in this act of gross moral turpitude.\n\n\u201cWe, on our part, will continue to interrogate the current system, which treats elected representatives of the people as mere prefects, while appointed office holders ride rough shod over them as Lords of the Manor.\n\n\u201cIf the purported Chief Security Officers of the states of the federation require clearance from the office of the IGP on matters within their areas of jurisdictions, only hypocrites will wonder why the current security crisis deepens and there appears to be no solution in the foreseeable future.\n\n(Continued on www.sunnewsonline.com)\n\n\u201cWe stand by our brother, the Governor of Lagos State. We advise him to deploy the regional security outfit in the state to protect the lives and property of the people.\n\n\u201cWe call on the President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces to rein in the excesses of certain elements bent on acting in a manner capable of eroding the bond of trust existing between the people and the Federal Government.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

We see it as a vituperation of ulterior motives of some political class who derived pleasure in dragging the name of Malami in the mud to achieve some sinister objectives.\n\n\u201cIt is widely reported in the papers that the Lagos state Governor was quoted to have said \u201cI\u2019ve spoken extensively with the Inspector-General of Police and the Honourable Attorney-General, and we\u2019ve resolved all the issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, would appreciate if the coalition of the Governors will help to unravel the circumstances preventing the Lagos State Government from enforcing the court order despite several attempts from 2012- 2015 and so-called settlement initiative started in 2016.\n\n\u201cSome of the cardinal pillars of democratic Government are the doctrine of separation of powers and obedience to the rule of law inclusive of Court Orders.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that execution of the judgment and orders of Courts of competent jurisdiction, and the Court of last resort in the circumstances remains a cardinal component of the rule of law and the office of the Attorney General wonders how maintenance of the law and orders in the course of execution of the judgment of the supreme can be adjudged by imagination of the governors to be unruly.\n\nWe want restate that sanctity of the rule of law is not a matter of choice\u201d.",

          "text": "\u2022Sugar tax now on all non-alcoholic, carbonated beverages\n\n\u2022Plans fuel subsidy removal for second half of 2022\n\n\u2022Restates readiness to conduct national census\n\n\u2022FIRS generated N6.4trn in 2021\n\n\u2022Independent revenue collections surpassed N1trn last year\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos; Ndubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday disclosed that henceforth it would charge offshore companies providing digital services to local customers in Nigeria a six per cent tax on turnover as provided in the 2021 Finance Act.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, disclosed this during the public presentation and breakdown of the 2022 budget held in Abuja.\n\nAlso, Ahmed disclosed that as of November 2021, the government had surpassed all collections for its independent revenues from 2017 to date, which according to her reflected the performance of government\u2019s revenue growth initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe have now for the first time surpassed the 1 trillion mark collection for independent revenues (N1.104tn) collected as at November against a budget target of 973.41bn). Analysts have always considered our projections unrealistic, but we have always insisted on the potentials that exist to grow FGN independent revenues,\u201d she revealed.\n\nSpeaking further on the tax on digital services, she explained that it includes apps, high frequency trading, electronic data storage and online advertising, adding that, \u201cthis is introducing turnover tax on a fair and reasonable basis.\u201d\n\nThe new policy is contained in Section 30 of the Finance Act which amended the provisions of Section 10, 31 and 14 on VAT obligations for non-resident digital companies.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cSection 30 of the Finance Act designed to amend section 10, 31 and 14 of VAT is in relations to VAT obligations for non-resident digital companies and the mechanism that will be used is to restrict VAT obligations mainly to digital non-resident companies who supply individuals in Nigeria who can\u2019t themselves self-account for VAT.\n\n\u201cSo if you visit Amazon, we are expecting Amazon to add VAT charge to whatever transaction you are paying for. I am using Amazon as an example. We are going to be working with Amazon to be registered as a tax agent for the FIRS.\n\n\u201cSo Amazon will now collect this payment and remit to FIRS and this is in line with global best practices, we have been missing out on this stream of revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the new law applies to foreign companies that provide digital services such as apps, high-frequency trading, electronic data storage, online and advertising, among others.\n\nShe noted that in line with Section 4 of the Finance Act, non-resident companies are now expected to pay tax at six per cent per cent on their turnover.\n\nThe minister who stated that the government was desirous of modernising taxes for its digital economy and to improve compliance, noted that digital non-resident companies do not need to be registered locally but would have an arrangement with the Federal Inland Revenue Services(FIRS) to collect and remit taxes in a bid to reduce the compliance burden.\n\nShe also disclosed that the federal government has introduced an excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages in the country.\n\nThe minister stated that the charge on beverages was also a new policy introduced in the Finance Act which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021, alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nThe minister pointed out that the new sugar tax was introduced to raise excise duties and revenues for health-related and other critical expenditures in line with the 2022 budget priorities.\n\nThe aimed according to her, was to also discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages, which contributed to diabetes, obesity and other diseases adding that the Finance Act had also raised excise duties and revenues for the health sector.\n\nShe also said that a provision had been made under the Act to reinforce the FIRS mandate as the principal tax collection agency while collaborating with other law enforcement Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nSpeaking further, Ahmed expressed the preparedness of the federal government to conduct the national population and housing census, which was last held in Nigeria over 15 years ago.\n\nAhmed had in November last year disclosed that the sum of N178.09 billion had been approved for the national population census in the 2022 budget.\n\nThe minister disclosed that necessary budgetary allocation had been made and every machinery put in motion to conduct the exercise, adding that it was left for the National Population Commission (NPC) to draw up a timetable.\n\nAhmed also revealed that Nigeria\u2019s independent revenue surpassed the N1 trillion mark in 2021, due to the implementation of the 2020 Finance Act.\n\nOn fuel subsidy, the minister said as provided by the Petroleum Industry Act, all petroleum products must be deregulated.\n\nFlowing from this, she said subsidy was provided for subsidy up to June after which full deregulation comes on stream.\n\nThe minister stated that subsidy was provided up to June to allow ongoing consultations with various stakeholders, including organised labour to be concluded\n\nOn how to mitigate the impact of the subsidy removal, Zainab said a committee set up by government to work out measures that would cushion the effect on Nigerians, especially the vulnerable ones would make recommendations on the way out.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill of N17.13 trillion into law on December 31, 2021 having laid the proposal before the National Assembly on October 7, 2021.\n\nThe president had also signed the 2021 finance bill into law on same day.\n\nThe two chambers had increased the spending plan by N735.8 billion from the proposed N16.391tn to N17.126 trillion. They had also raised the oil benchmark from $57 per barrel proposed by the executive to $62.\n\nThe National Assembly had also fixed oil production at 1.88 million barrels per day, exchange rate at N410.15 to the dollar, GDP at 4.2 percent and inflation at 13 percent.\n\nIn his presentation, the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, disclosed that about N6.4 trillion was collected by as taxes by the service last year.\n\nAlso, in his virtual presentation, the Group Managing Director Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, said the country now produces 1.74 million barrels of crude oil per day.\n\nBut he said the security situation in the country had cut the figures to 1.5 million barrels about three months ago before the latest improvement.\n\nHe said, \u201cThree months ago we came down to 1.5 million barrels per day because of security issues and we are responding to it.\n\n\u201cAs of today production has increased to 1.74 million barrels per day and there are ongoing interventions to better the situation on security.\n\n\u201cThe expectations are that within the month, we will get to 1.8 million barrels per day and exceed the limit within the year.\u201d\n\n2021 BUDGET PERFORMANCE\n\nIn a presentation, the Minister disclosed that as at November 2021, federal government\u2019s aggregate revenue was N5.51 trillion, which was 74 per cent of its target for the fiscal year.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s share of oil revenues was N970.3 billion (representing 53% performance of the prorated sum in the 2021 budget), while federal government\u2019s share of non-oil tax revenues totalled N1.62 trillion (118.8% over and above the target).\n\nAlso, Companies Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) collections were N718.58 billion and N360.56 billion, representing 115 per cent and 165 per cent respectively of the prorata targets for the period. In 2021, Customs collections was N542.11 billion (104% of the target), while other revenues amounted to N2.8 trillion, of which the federal government\u2019s independent revenues was N1.1 trillion while Government Owned Entities\u2019 (GOEs\u2019) retained revenues was N1.20 trillion\n\nOn the expenditure side, she revealed that N12.56 trillion (or 94.1%) had been spent out of the N13.57 trillion prorata budget. This performance was inclusive of expenditure estimates of the GOEs but exclusive of Project-tied Loans.\n\nOf the expenditure, N4.20 trillion was for debt service, and N3.02 trillion for personnel cost, including pensions.\n\nAs at November 2021, the federal government has expended N3.40 trillion for capital budget. Of this, N2.98 trillion represented 83 per cent of the provision for Ministries, Departments and Agencies\u2019 (MDAs\u2019) capital, N369.9 billion for multilateral/bilateral Project-tied loans, and N49.52 billion as GOEs capital expenditure\n\n2022 BUDGET KEY ASSUMPTION, ESTIMATES\n\nZainab pointed out that the 2022 budget seeks to continue the reflationary policies of the 2020 and 2021 budgets of the government, which according to her, helped put the economy back on the path of recovery and growth.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budget was prepared taking into consideration the policies/strategies contained in the 2022\u20132024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP).\n\n\u201cThe Budget was prepared using the Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) approach and in line with the government\u2019s development priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2025. Allocations to MDAs were guided by the core objectives of the NDP 2021 \u2013 2025.\n\n\u201cThe plan, with an investment size of N348.1 trillion, will be funded by the federal, state governments and the private sector. The 2022 federal government budget is the first key public sector contribution to implementing the plan,\u201d she explained.\n\nIn terms of its key assumptions in the area of crude oil production, Ahmed noted that although Nigeria\u2019s total production capacity was 2.5 mbpd, current (year to date) crude production was about 1.4mbpd (slightly short of the OPEC+ production quota), and an additional 300,000bpd of condensates, totaling about 1.6mbpd.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that global oil production would increase to match rising levels of global oil consumption.\n\nOPEC crude production was projected to average 28.34 million barrels per day in 2022 higher than 26.94 million barrels per day forecast for 2021.\n\n\u201cWe projected our base oil price at $57/bbl in 2022 in consultation with NNPC and other stakeholders. This was premised on the averages of forecasts by leading institutions, factors driving market fundamentals, global economic recovery, plans by governments and market sentiments.\n\n\u201cHowever, the National Assembly increased the proposed 2022 oil price benchmark of $57pbl to $62pbl. World Bank forecasts that crude oil prices will average $74pb in\n\n2022 as oil demand strengthens and reaches pre-pandemic levels. The EIA expects Brent prices to average $70.05 per barrel in 2022,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister, while commenting on the critical sectoral allocations of the 2022 budget, said the education sector received N1.234 trillion with 815.69 billion allocated to the Ministry of Education and its agencies for recurrent and capital expenditure.\n\nShe also said N112.29 billion earmarked for the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), while N306 billion was allocated for Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) for infrastructure projects in tertiary institutions.\n\nThe health sector got N876.38 billion, representing 5.1 per cent of the total budget. The Ministry of Health and its agencies would received N770.87 billion for recurrent and capital expenditure including hazard allowance.\n\nThe defence and security sector gulped 13.4 per cent of the budget or N2.29 trillion while N1.42 trillion or 8.3 per cent of the budget was set aside for infrastructure development out of which N462 billion is mapped out for social development and poverty reduction programmes.\n\nMACRO ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS\n\nThe federal government projected that in 2022, consumption would increase by about 9.36 per cent, from a revised N136.57 trillion in 2021 to N149.35 trillion in the present fiscal year. Nominal GDP was also projected to rise from N168.60 trillion in 2021 to N184.38 trillion in 2022 and then up to N221.78 trillion in 2024, while real GDP growth forecast was 4.2 per cent in 2022, 2.3 per cent for 2023 (election year impact) and 3.3 per cent in 2024.\n\nIn addition, inflation was projected to be double digit in the medium-term given structural issues impacting cost of doing business, including high food distribution cost.\n\n\u201cHowever, current steady decline is expected to be sustained, seeing inflation rate drop to 13 per cent in 2022 and 10 per cent by 2024,\u201d the minister further projected.\n\nWHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM\n\nAhmed in her presentation, stated that the projected aggregate revenue available to fund the 2022 budget of N10.74 trillion (inclusive of GOEs) was 32 per cent higher than the 2021 projection of N8.12 trillion.\n\nWithout the GOEs retained revenue, the government\u2019s revenue was projected at N9.01 trillion.\n\nShe disclosed that in order to promote fiscal transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness, allocations to TETFUND and the budgets of 63 GOEs were integrated in the federal government\u2019s 2022 budget proposal.\n\nIn aggregate, 35 per cent of projected revenues is to come from oil-related sources while 65 per cent is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nThe 2022 aggregate federal government expenditure (inclusive of GOEs and project-tied Loans) was projected to be N17.13 trillion, which was 18 per cent higher than the 2021 Budget.\n\nOn the other hand, recurrent (non-debt) spending, estimated to amount to N6.91 trillion, was 40 per cent of total expenditure, and 20 per cent higher than the 2021 budget.\n\nShe also disclosed that aggregate capital expenditure of N5.96 trillion was 35 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nThis provision was inclusive of capital component of statutory transfers, GOEs capital and project-tied loans expenditures.\n\nAt N3.61 trillion, debt service was 21 per cent of total expenditure and 34 per cent of total revenues.\n\nProvision to retire maturing bonds to local contractors/suppliers of N270.71 billion was 1.6 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nThe minister said the provision was in line with the federal government\u2019s commitment to off-set accumulated arrears of contractual obligations dating back over a decade.\n\n\u201cOverall budget deficit is N6.39 trillion for 2022. This represents 3.46 per cent of GDP.\n\nBudget deficit is to be financed mainly by borrowings: Domestic sources -N2.57 trillion; foreign sources \u2013 N2.57 trillion; multi-lateral /bi-lateral loan drawdowns \u2013 N1.16 trillion and privatisation proceeds \u2013 N90.7 billion,\u201d she added.\n\nNIGERIA\u2019S DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\n\nAhmed reiterated that the federal government\u2019s debt level was still within sustainable limits. According to her, borrowings were essentially for capital expenditure and Human Development, as specified in Section 41(1)a of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\n\u201cHaving witnessed two economic recessions we have had to spend our way out of recession, which contributed significantly to the growth in the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have been as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded partly by debt.\n\n\u201cTo compound matters, the country has technically been at war, with the pervasive security challenges across the nation. This has necessitated massive expenditure on security equipment and operations, contributing to the fiscal deficit; Defence and Security sector accounts for 22 per cent of the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Budget Deficit/GDP (-4.3%, as at November 2021) and Debt/GDP ratios (30% as at September 2021) are the lowest among Africa\u2019s leading economies;\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria\u2019s Debt Service/Revenue ratio (76% as at November 2021) is the highest among same African top economies. This is proof that what we have is not a classic debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge.\n\n\u201cTax rates and compliance ratios are significantly higher in these comparator countries; For instance, Nigeria\u2019s VAT rate of 7.5 per cent is the lowest in Africa, and less than 50% of the average rate,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, efforts are ongoing to fix the country\u2019s revenue challenge, saying cutting expenditure would not be a viable option.\n\n\u201cWe must however continue to rationalise our expenditures as we cannot afford waste. In reality, our largest expenditure items are currently personnel cost, debt service and capital expenditure, which between them account for 85 per cent of the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cThere is very little scope for cut in any of these over the medium term. The most viable solution to our fiscal challenge therefore remains to grow our revenues and plug all leakages.\n\n\u201cOur target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8\n\n\u2013 9 percent currently to 15 per cent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-to- Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be a critical concern,\u201d the minister added.\n\nShe listed some measures to increase revenue to include improving tax administration framework including tax filing and payment compliance improvements; evaluation of the process and policy effectiveness of fiscal Incentives, including: review of sectors eligible for Pioneer Tax Holiday Incentives under the Industrial\n\nDevelopment Income Tax Relief Act (\u2018IDITRA\u2019); dimensioning the cost of tax waivers/concessions, and evaluating their policy effectiveness; setting annual ceilings on tax expenditures to better manage their impact on already constrained government revenues and ensuring that MDAs appropriately account for and remit their internally generated revenue, among others.\n\n\u201cGovernment will continue to create the enabling environment for private sector to increase their investment and contribute significantly to job creation, economic growth and lifting millions of our citizens out of poverty. Early passage of the 2022 Budget for implementation from January 1, will significantly contribute towards achieving government macro-fiscal and sectoral objectives.\n\n\u201cHowever, revenue currently remains our main fiscal challenge. Government remains committed to the effective implementation of the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives to improve revenue collection, expenditure management and fiscal sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic about our ability to finance the budget considering the positive global oil market outlook and the continuing improvement in our non-oil revenues. We shall explore available opportunities for public-private partnerships, concessions as well as climate finance arrangements to fast-track the pace of our infrastructural development,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says he will sign electoral bill, if N\u2019Assembly includes consensus option, indirect primaries\n\n\u2022Declares state police not an option in tackling insecurity\n\n\u2022President\u2019s aversion to state police means he\u2019s comfortable with insecurity, posits Ayu\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, revealed that he had his own agenda regarding the person that would succeed him, but he would be playing his cards close to his chest until the 2023 general election because he did not want the fellow eliminated before his time.\n\nBuhari spoke during an interview on Channels Television.\n\nHe promised to assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill only if the National Assembly removed the clause mandating political parties to conduct their election primaries directly. He had declined assent to the bill last month, saying it is undemocratic to constrain political parties to a mode of primary election, as provided in the bill. But, despite widespread clamour, he ruled out establishment of state police as solution to rising insecurity in the country, saying, \u201cState police is not an option.\u201d\n\nReacting to the president\u2019s indisposition to the popular agitation for state police, National Chairman of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, accused Buhari of being comfortable with the state of insecurity in the country. Ayu said this could be gleaned from the president\u2019s declaration that \u201cstate police is not an option\u201d.\n\nAnswering a question on his likely successor, Buhari said, \u201cNo, I will not tell you, because he may be eliminated if I mention his name.\u201d But he added that it did not really matter who succeeded him, saying whoever wins the election will succeed him.\n\nOn the electoral bill, Buhari maintained that primaries must not be direct, but rather, people should be given options to make their choice.\n\nHe stated, \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t support direct primaries, because I want people to be given a choice. You can\u2019t give them one option and think you are being democratic. Let them be given the three options, which are direct, indirect and consensus. If you could recall, ACN, APGA, ANPP, CPC and another party, we came together.\n\n\u201cPDP was over confident and thought they will rule Nigeria to the end of time. But the opposition, we came together and overthrew them. We didn\u2019t overthrow PDP because of direct primaries but because of the opposition coming together and fighting the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe must not insist that it has to be direct primary, it should be consensus and indirect. Once that\u2019s done, I will sign the electoral bill. There should be options, you can\u2019t dictate to people and you say you\u2019re doing democracy. Allow them to have options to make a choice.\u201d\n\nThe president assured that bandits, particularly in the North-west, explaining that progress is being made in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe advocated more dialogue in solving the farmer-herder clashes across the country. According to him, \u201cFor Nigerians to be fair to this administration, is to try and find out from the time we won the election in 2015 till now in the three promises we made, which are improving security, economy and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cIn the North-west, it\u2019s same people killing each other, burning villages. I think the only language they understand we discussed it with the law enforcement agencies, the service chiefs, IGP is to go after the terrorists. We named them terrorists and we are going to deal with them as such.\n\n\u201cIf you go to those constituencies over the last four weeks, there\u2019s improvement in the security. On farmer/headers\u2019 crisis, we cannot do much about the weather but about the security, we\u2019ve taken steps and we are seeing the results. For the weather, the ministers of agriculture from Audu Ogbeh to Mahmoud now, one of the issues I discussed with them is to go and get the gazettes on cattle routes and grazing grounds and the cattle rearers are confined to those areas.\n\n\u201cThose that go outside that one are arrested and farmers are encouraged to come and lay their claims. We have to go back to that system again to try and make sure we prepare grazing areas, so that headers don\u2019t stray into peoples farms and into the towns and so on. We are working on that.\n\nHowever, Buhari failed to either endorse or reject the suggestion by the Governor of Kaduna state, Mr Nasir el-Rufai for the carpet-bombing of the terrorists irrespective of the magnitude of collateral damage and casualties.\n\nHe stated that he campaigned on three fundamental issues, namely security, corruption and the economy, stressing that on the three promises, security in the north east, which he said was very bad when he took over, has now improved.\n\nBut he noted that while the renewed attack on the gunmen must be sustained, it was important to provide protection for communities and their leaders who were helping in providing intelligence to the security agencies.\n\n\u201cI think the only language they understand, we have discussed it thoroughly with the service chiefs and the Inspector General of Police (IG), and it is to go after the terrorists. We have labelled them terrorists and we are going to deal with them as such.\n\n\u201cI told you what we have done. We met at least four times with the service chiefs and law enforcement agencies, each meeting taking at least four hours. We have discussed thoroughly what to do with the situation.\n\n\u201cWe met at least four times with the service chiefs and other law enforcement agencies, each meeting taking at least four hours. We have discussed thoroughly what to do with the situation. Luckily, I have a military background from civil war till now, so, we discussed and we tried to secure and make it safe for the leadership at community level.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s very important, the best intelligence you get is from the local leadership. They know who\u2019s who in their areas of responsibilities. You have to talk to them but you must make sure they are safe, because the bandits can be a source of insecurity to them or their families and we are very conscious of that.\u201d\n\nOn state police as a solution to insecurity, Buhari opined that state police was not an option, alluding to the propensity for governors to abuse the security institution.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, the role of traditional rulers must not be undermined, because in their areas they know who\u2019s who. So, we have to revert to that system for us to have effective security in the localities. For example, there were two governors that came to see me about the problem and I said as far as I know, the farmers and the herders have been coexisting in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet them go and ask the local leadership what went wrong, why the break in communication between the local leadership and the herders, why are they now extending to people\u2019s farms.\n\n\u201cState police is not an option. Find out now the relationship between the local government and their governors. Are they getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Try and see those people from local government let them tell you the truth about the fight between local government and governors.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, the president revealed that the crude oil production quota from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day. He said at a point, the production quota was reduced by half.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen we came in, somehow the militants were unleashed in the South-south, and production went down to half a million barrels per day. But look at what we did within the time frame with the resources available to us?\u201d\n\nBuhari expressed displeasure at the state of electricity in Nigeria.\n\nWhen asked if he was happy with the country\u2019s electricity production capacity, the president replied, \u201cI am not because I identify that no country can develop without infrastructure and infrastructure means road, rail and power. This government is working very hard on the road. Try to imagine what was happening between Lagos to Ibadan six months ago and what it is now. We are doing from Lagos to Kano the rail, road from here to Kaduna to Kano. So we have to get the infrastructure right and then Nigerians will mind their own business. But when the infrastructure is not there, the roads are not there, the rail is virtually killed, no power, what do we expect people to do?\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) was 100 per cent government-owned, saying his government inherited the Distribution Companies (Discos).\n\nHe alleged that the owners of Discos bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cThe people that own them, who are they? They are not electrical engineers, they don\u2019t have money, it is just a political favour. To remove a system and reintroduce one is no joke. Luckily we have the TCN and that is the transmission. If we can get our technology right, we will cut the cost on transmission and the likelihood of sabotaging the lines and so on.\u201d\n\nThe president advised Nigerian youths to use their education and exposure to improve themselves and not depend on government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish when they go to school; when they work hard; when they earn their degree, they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs\n\nYou get educated because an educated person is certainly better than an uneducated person even in identifying personal problems. So, education is not just meant to hang on to the government to give you jobs and then what the colonialists indoctrinated in us to believe \u2013 have a car, have a house; start work by 8am and close by 2pm.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the possibility of releasing the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, Buhari ruled out the option of pardon. But he acknowledged the possibility of a political resolution.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cNigerians know that I don\u2019t interfere with the judiciary. Let him be listened to. For those, who are saying that we should release him, no, we cannot release him. There is a possibility of political solution.\n\n\u201cIf people behave themselves, all well and good, but you can\u2019t go to a foreign country and keep on sending incorrect economic and security problem against your country and think that you will never have to account for what you have been doing. Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nAsked what comes to mind whenever he heard the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Buhari responded, \u201cfailure\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu accused Buhari of being comfortable with the insecurity in the country.\n\nAyu also criticised the president for pushing the blame for the incessant killing of farmers by terrorists to locals along grazing routes.\n\nThe PDP national chairman was responding to some of the issues raised in Buhari\u2019s interview on Channels Television.\n\nAyu\u2019s Media Office quoted the PDP national chairman as saying, \u201cIt appears the continued killings in some localities of Nigeria, particularly, in the North, and more specifically in President Buhari\u2019s home state of Katsina, may not matter to him with his statement that state police is not an option.\n\n\u201cWatching President Muhammadu Buhari this evening on Channels TV during an interview session was a gratuitous waste of time, because there was nothing new coming from the president. As said by many before now, to expect anything new from our president would be a misplaced and unfortunate expectation.\n\n\u201cFrom the economy, to insecurity, killing of innocent farmers by terrorists (which some erroneously term farmer/herder clashes) and other sundry issues, President Buhari honoured his calling as a president, who has nothing new to offer.\n\n\u201cHe again repeated the impotent argument regarding killing of farmers by terrorists, reminding Nigerians of grazing routes. Well, what the president failed to reference is that the herders plying the grazing routes before, neither carried AK47s, nor did they engage in raping of women and despoliation of the assets of those along the routes.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s position of saying the locals should be asked what went wrong, flies in the face of reason and contemporary realities. Tied to that, but not limited in scope, is the issue of insecurity and a re-organisation of the Nigeria Police to accommodate present, peculiar, environmental and social challenges.\n\n\u201cIn President Buhari\u2019s view, state police is not an option. Yet, it appears the continued killings in some localities of Nigeria, particularly, in the North, and more specifically, in his home state of Katsina, may not matter, hence, the need to have a security system that feeds on local intelligence and nuances, which the federal police cannot adequately provide, is not an option to our president.\n\n\u201cTo him, it appears that continuing the same process while expecting a different output and outcome is the best way to go. We ask, is he comfortable with the killings in the land while the status quo persists?\n\n\u201cNigerians should remind President Buhari that people evolve and societies evolve. Therefore, being trapped in a time capsule of the past about state police is not an option Nigerians are willing to accept from him.\n\n\u201cOn the economic front, nations of the world who enjoy the benefit of direct foreign investments (DFI) ensure that their countries are safe for investors to pour in their resources. No amount of propaganda will obviate the realities on ground and which embassies and foreign missions observe.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to ensure that investor confidence is restored, a safe environment must, of necessity, be created. Our government is trapped in the mentality of believing its own lies that Nigeria is better today than it was under PDP. To those who share this fallacy, we ask: Would they wish for their lives to be like Nigeria under this present regime? The lives of Nigerians today tell the true story.\n\n\u201cThe more Buhari promises to lift Nigerians out of poverty, the poorer Nigerians become. To further dwell on the entire interview would be to waste valuable time. But we implore Nigerians not to relent, because hope is on the way and, like one writer said, hope is better served as breakfast and not dinner, as the APC regime of President Buhari is doing, promising El Dorado in the dying days of its tenure.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerians on social media have lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari over his comment that the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, should defend himself in court for peddling false information about his regime while he (Kanu) was overseas.\n\nBuhari had stated this in an interview aired on Channels Television on Wednesday night which was monitored by SaharaReporters.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari\n\nThere have been pressures on Buhari to release Kanu including a recent visit by some Igbo elders led by the Minister of Aviation in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi.\n\nDuring the visit on November 19, 2021, Buhari had told them he would not want to interfere in the running of the judiciary but said he would consider their demand though \u201ca heavy one.\u201d\n\nBut speaking on Wednesday night during the television interview, the President said, \u201cThere is one institution that I wouldn\u2019t interfere with, that is judiciary, Kanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary but what I wonder is when Kanu was safely in Europe, abusing this administration and mentioning too many things, I thought he wants to come and defend himself on the accusations.\n\n\u201cSo, we are giving him an opportunity to defend himself in our system, not to be abusing us from Europe as if he was not a Nigerian. Let him come here with us and then criticise us here. Nigerians know that I don\u2019t interfere with the judiciary, let him be listened to. But those who are saying that he should be released, no, we cannot release him.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement of the president didn't sit well with some Nigerians who asked if the judiciary was actually functional, while accusing the Buhari administration of disobedience to several court orders.\n\nSaharaReporters aggregated some of the reactions;\n\nA Facebook user, Emerenwa Anthony commented: \u201cNobody is begging you to release him because it is clear to even your misguided brothers in the bush that he committed no offence known to any law.\n\n\u201cHis only grouse with you is the total freedom of Biafrans from the star crossed and unworkable contraption called Nigeria. It is his inalienable right to demand freedom from associating with savages and anti-social and developmental elements in the 21st century.\"\n\nAnother user, Darlington Ogbonna posted, \u201cWhen a government begins to run from the court, it's a big sign of weakness and incompetence. MNK is an institution and that is a bitter truth.\"\n\nDivine Dominic noted, \u201cIf only our judiciary is working but God pass you (Buhari) and APC government, Nnamdi Kanu will surely come out victoriously.\u201d\n\nObed Etobe wrote: \u201cKanu's trial should be holistic. The law should also inquire into the criminality, if any, of the federal government in kidnapping an individual and bundling him, against his will, from one jurisdiction to another. Is kidnapping a lesser crime than demanding self-determination?\"\n\nSunrise Friday stated: \u201cGovernment should not run away from court or play hide and seek. MNK is not jittery.\"\n\nAmina Oyetunde said: \u201cWhile the real ex Boko Haram boys are being given the rehabilitation treatment in the Nigerian Military Service and being compensated with terrorist sheikh Gumi free blanket amnesty first theory and the second theory of building schools, malls, libraries, worship centres, slaughtering centres, stadium... for terrorists using the Federal Government money.\u201d\n\nSteve Fatile wrote: \u201cDefending himself for doing what? Abba!!! Buhari. He is fighting for freedom without killing anybody, freedom that everyone needs under your failed government.\u201d\n\nEdu Ransom stated: \u201cCommon sense please, if you can't release him then why waste his precious time in court? The statement is clear, no justice in Nigeria judiciary.\u201d\n\nA Facebook user, Ajibodu Bashir said: \u201cIt's beyond my imagination that we can arrest someone in Kenya for crime against the country but we can't do the same even though criminals are residing in Sokoto, Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, and so on.\u201d\n\nOlomo Jacob stated: \u201cGive Nnamdi Kanu accelerated and fair hearing to prove himself. Stop trying him behind the scenes out of public knowledge.\"\n\nFrank Adewale wrote on Facebook: \u201cTell your power-drunk and corrupt DSS to provide him in court to defend himself, why hiding him to face judgement.\u201d\n\nObum Honesty opined, \u201cCourts have no power in Buhari's government...a shame to the judiciary.\"\n\nOfoegbu Chidinma said: \u201cThen Government of Buhari should stop running away from their own Court.\u201d\n\nAmusan Sunday said: \u201cEven if he is defending himself in the court of law, will there be fairness? Is like he is already condemned before trial.\u201d\n\nJeff Nicky stated: \u201cWhich court? The one you've influenced with your impunity? You're joking Sir.\"\n\nOnwa G. Na Igbo said: \u201cWhereas you are boycotting your own court, but I also hope that you will swallow your pride and obey the law by following legal procedure.\u201d\n\nMartins Ngere wrote: \u201cThe court that lacks competent jurisdiction I don't have confidence in Nigerian court period politics have taken the system they are not independent.\"\n\nNathaniel Okoro: \"The same court you are running away from.\"\n\nChuks Man: \"Is that court still working? I guess you should come to the court as well.\u201d\n\nIn reaction to the report, Samuel Joe queried, \u201cHas he not defended himself enough? You and the so-called AGF kept amending charges in order to just keep him there when it's clear you have no case against him. We have seen in the past when your failed government rrefused to grant him bail even when the court freed him. Continue with your tyranny, it will soon be over.\u201d\n\nEzenwata Sunny said: \u201cPresident Buhari is just being political over so many issues during this interview and he hasn't respected any court order... Why will he suggest the court now?\"\n\nFabian Ejikeme wrote, \u201cIf you really want him to defend himself in the court stop adjourning the case.\"\n\nEmmanuel Chukwu stated: \u201cThat's better. Your prosecuting counsel should stop hiding and making court adjourn the case. Or are they scared of proving their charges?\u201d",

All evidence gathered so far has shown that this is not the true story but a way to cover up their negligence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe father alleged what he described as a \u201cconspiracy among the officials of the Lagos state government and the police to cover up the circumstances surrounding the death of the schoolboy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that in the DPP advice, the State of Lagos claims that the five suspects have no case to answer. In whose custody was my son Sylvester Oromoni Jnr. when the substance was forcefully administered to him?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI call on the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, inspector general of police, chairman National Human Rights Commission, civil society, international human right groups, and the general public to help me get justice.\u201d\n\nOromoni\u2019s father had earlier kicked against a statement attributed to Odumosu, implying that the first autopsy on their deceased son was not witnessed by the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nEarlier this month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up.\nWhat\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\nIntra-regional conflictThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d.\nIn Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\nLanguage barrierThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region.",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Cars45, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Personally, every prayer point this year will have 23x in it; I must not be left out.\n\nAs people announced an incredulous increase in income levels, the African startup ecosystem also saw a significant rise in funding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ecosystem wasn\u2019t left out of the 2x trend. Briter Bridges\u2019 African Investment Report 2021 has revealed that African startups raised $4.9 billion in 2021. That\u2019s more than the $1.3billion raised in 2020.\n\nFintech still rules: As usual, fintech startups received the lion share, going as high as 62% \u2014 $3 billion. Healthtech came in second with 8%, followed by other top sectors, including logistics, edtech, cleantech, and agritech. Interestingly, fintech accounted for 31% of funding in 2020, while cleantech was second with 22%.\n\nNigeria held the top position as the country with the most deals and funding, coming from second place in 2020. South Africa was second while Kenya and Egypt were third and fourth, respectively.\n\nWhich sector will overtake fintech? My money is still on fintech leading the pack in 2022.\n\nHowever, some other sectors have been gaining significant investor attention. Briter Bridges\u2019 report showed that after payments, transfers, and banking, medical delivery, and B2B eCommerce are some of the most funded products.\n\nOur reporter, Chimgozirim, will be doing a detailed article on the report. Kindly look out for it before the week runs out.\n\nCrypto price predictions for 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nThe crypto market in 2021 started on a very bullish note. The first and biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, Bitcoin, began the year with an all-time high (ATH) of $28,994.\n\nIn April 2021, surpassing ATH after ATH, it reached $63,285, a 118% increase between January and April. However, a downtrend began in May; Bitcoin fell by almost 51%, trading at less than $35,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the end of the year, Bitcoin proved why it was number one with an epic bounce back, recording another ATH of over $66,000 in October. However, it could not sustain the price as it dropped to a low of $47,000 at the year\u2019s close.\n\nBesides Bitcoin, 2021 had interesting tokens such as SHIBA INU that grew by 49,000,000%. Investing $100 in the token in 2020 would have culminated into a whopping $53 million during its 2021 ATH.\n\nWhat does the future hold for the crypto market in 2022? 2021 has taught us that innovation has a huge role to play when it comes to crypto prices. The Solana blockchain came up with faster transactions at low costs, offering innovative capabilities like NFTs and decentralised finance just like Ethereum.\n\nIts native coin, Sol, grew by more than 16,000% in 2021. We also saw gaming and metaverse tokens such as Decentraland and Sandbox record impressive gains.\n\nAnalytics Insights has highlighted predictions that include Bitcoin reaching $100,000 and SHIBA INU recording another 300% gain.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll be examining these predictions and how they correlate with innovations in the blockchain space. Make sure you watch out for editions of Crypto Explorer this month.\n\nmPharma secures $35m Series D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nGhanaian healthtech startup, mPharma, has closed a $35 million Series D to become the primary healthcare provider for millions of Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the funding comprises $30 million equity funding and $5 million debt financing by Citibank. The $30 million equity financing saw investments from JAM Fund, Unbound and Lux Capital.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Gregory Rockson, Daniel Shoukimas, and James Finucane, mPharma started as a prescription drug inventory. Now, it has mutti pharmacies that serve as mini hospitals, providing services including medical consultation, diagnostic, and telehealth services which it added in October 2021.\n\nAccording to Joseph Opoku, Global Operations Manager, mPharma, the company is building the largest telemedicine network in Africa through its mutti pharmacies.\n\nmPharma plans to use the funding to build out its data infrastructure and invest in skilled talents like doctors and nurses, and other professionals relevant to its cause.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOn the National Red Line.

The Nation reports that the company has met the six conditions imposed by the Nigerian government.\n\nTo refresh your memory, here are the conditions that the Federal government insisted on: an office in Nigeria, a country representative, payment of fair taxes, register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)/get a license from the National Broadcasting Commission, sensitivity to national security and cohesion, and train Nigerian IT personnel and strategic intelligence officers on how to report Twitter abuse/infractions noticed by the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a source quoted by The Nation, Twitter\u2019s hesitance to open an office in Nigeria last year stemmed from it not being part of its 2021 budget. The source also expressed optimism that as the new year rolls out, the company will open an office.\n\nWhile it sounds like good news, this raises a few concerns. The first is that going by the report, Twitter is being coerced into opening an office in Nigeria. Ideally, this should create jobs and government revenue but could ensure government control over the microblogging site.\n\nAppointing a country representative also enables the government to hold someone accountable whenever they believe that Twitter has infringed on some of its laws.\n\nThis is the second time that reports have suggested that the ban could be lifted, and Nigerians would hope that things play out differently this time. However, owing to Twitter\u2019s silence on negotiations, it could be that it takes some time before the ban is lifted.\n\nGahez raises $2 million in pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgyptian eCommerce startup, Gahez, has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding. Disruptech Ventures led the round with Egypt Ventures, Tanmeyah, Afropreneur fund, and other angel investors participating.\n\nLaunched last year, the startup joins a slew of B2B eCommerce startups trying to digitise operations for Africa\u2019s merchants and manufacturers. Having worked with over 15,000 merchants and 142 manufacturers since its launch, the startup plans to use this fresh injection of capital to build its technology and recruit more staff.\n\nCo-founder and CEO, Wael Olama, in a statement, said, \u201cWe are on a mission to revolutionise the way retailers shop for their stores by relieving the stress of managing and sourcing. We believe that the Egyptian/African apparel market is untapped and widely fragmented, which provides Gahez with the perfect opportunity (relying on technology) to scale and position itself within the sphere.\u201d\n\nFedaPay secures funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeninese startup, FedaPay, has announced a first round of investment from the Benin Business Angel Network (BBAN).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2018, FedaPay provides merchants with an efficient and secure payment system, enabling them to receive payments using cards and mobile money. Although the startup was founded in Benin, it has recently launched its services in neighbouring Niger.\n\nIn a statement, FedaPay\u2019s technical team lead and co-founder, Boris Koumondji, said, \u201cFedaPay is better than its Beninese competitors because it distinguishes itself by offering customised and flexible pricing that corresponds with its merchants\u2019 business models.\n\n\u201cFedaPay\u2019s payment method coverage allows them to take payments from customers via mobile money and bank cards in a single integration.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi, here.\n\nIt seems 2020, the year of the coronavirus, is looking to become a trilogy. For the third year running, people are living through different levels of lockdowns and increasing cases of COVID-19 and its variants. On the last day of 2021, Israel reportedly recorded a double infection of influenza and coronavirus \u2014 Florona \u2014 in a pregnant patient.\n\nAlthough this is not a variant of the virus like Delta and Omicron, experts can\u2019t say how severe a combination of this kind could be. Some countries are still reconsidering lifting lockdowns, while others have experienced more than three waves of the pandemic already. I\u2019m tempted to ask, \u201cwhen does all this end?\u201d So, this is another reminder for you to stay safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a lot happened in the last year; apart from Crypto Explorer \u2014 Emmanuel mentioned this yesterday \u2014 there are some interesting topical discourses/series we introduced/re-introduced in 2021 that I want to remind you of (I promise, this has nothing to do with COVID-19). But, before that, let\u2019s do a quick one on what happened to a once-upon-a-time sweetheart of the smartphone industry.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nBlackberry\u2019s demise\n\nThe Expert series\n\nLiving with learning disabilities\n\nRIP Blackberry devices, for reals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 4, 2022, devices using the Blackberry OS will be unable to make or receive calls (including emergency numbers like 911), send or receive texts, use mobile data or Wi-Fi. However, this does not affect Blackberry devices running on Android OS.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming. A steady decline in market acceptance has been noticed since 2013. The company stopped manufacturing its own phones in 2016 and began outsourcing to other hardware partner companies. In 2021, it gave prior notice about this discontinuation.\n\nNot exactly a complete death: Blackberry continues to run as a cybersecurity company. It pivoted to this enterprise in 2016. So, we could call this the end of an era.\n\nLooks familiar? Blackberry abandoning its mobile phone OS venture reminds me of the abrupt death of Windows phones in 2016 after running for six years. Half the time, experts predicted that it was bound to fail.\n\nSome quarters blamed the demise on the fact that Microsoft couldn\u2019t stand the market dominance of Google\u2019s Android OS and Apple\u2019s iOS. Others faulted its rigidity in adapting third-party apps, among other deficiencies.\n\nAlso, recall that Nokia and Motorola shared a similar fate, although the former was more shocking. Do you have a history with Blackberry? Please tell me about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2022 gets even better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we re-introduced The Experts series to our readers. It features the lives and exploits of African tech specialists across the world. So far, I\u2019ve picked the brains of the genius personality who, along with his team, built Interswitch\u2019s Quickteller, Wale Abba; talked to Rachael Akalia, one human that embodies the brand called Patricia Technologies, a Nigerian-founded Estonia-based alternative currencies startup.\n\nSubsequently, during a virtual chat, I got Mopewa Ogundipe to talk about her profession and journey to becoming the software engineer behind Clubhouse\u2019s long-awaited Android app; Nigerian-American, Abake Adenle also opened up about moving from a successful career in the UK\u2019s investment banking space to becoming an entrepreneur running a startup building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages.\n\nThe last editions for 2021 featured famous music artist and tech investor, Mr Eazi, and the leader of open banking in Nigeria, Adedeji Olowe, who demystified the concept of open banking while talking about his life.\n\nAlong the line, Kudi\u2019s Product Manager, Nifemi Akinwamide, opened our eyes to what it looks like to navigate a learning disability to become successful.\n\nThis year, look out for new editions that promise to be even more exciting and instructive. Subscribe to get notified.\n\nHow much do you know about learning deficiencies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms like dyslexia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and dyscalculia are rarely discussed within the Africa context, even for people living with the conditions. In 2020, our reporter, Victoria Fakiya, did in-depth reflections on these disabilities and discussed assistive technologies that can make life easier for people living with them. Click on the hyperlinks to catch up.\n\nMeanwhile, Precious Mogoli and Ogheneruemu Oneyibo also had interesting takes. Check them out here: Technology is awesome, but it\u2019s yet to conquer stuttering\n\nAnd here: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nTesla stock jumps after reporting record vehicle deliveries for 2021.

          "title": "Inside Mafab\u2019s plan to become major Nigerian telco",
          "text": "After emerging as one of the two provisional winners of the 5G spectrum licence, Mafab Communications has set out plans to become a major Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications operator, according to a proposed document seen by BusinessDay.\n\nIn the document, the company discloses it is going to the market to raise $350 million via equity to finance the cost of the spectrum licence and other associated projects costs.\n\nThe little known telecom operator is hoping to complete the funding before the licence fee deadline. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had noted that the two winners were expected to complete payment of the winning bid price for the auction at $273.6 million for each lot of 100 MHz TDD licence by February 24, 2022. That means Mafab Communications has less than seven weeks to come up with the money.\n\nIn the document, Mafab is not only looking to raise $350 million via equity, but also intends to raise $1.59 billion via debt to complete a total of $1.9 billion funding activity. Mafab plans to offer 70 million units of its shares at N5 for equity funding.\n\nThe company has a broad target of deploying into over 6,000 sites within a five-year period. Sites here may refer to the 40,000 base transceiver sites that are located in different parts of Nigeria. It intends to deploy into 1,000 sites in the first year, 2,500 in the second year, 4,000 in the third year, 5,000 in the fourth year, and 6,000 in the fifth year. Within that timeline, the company also hopes to have grown its subscriber base to 7.5 million.\n\nTo achieve the targets, it has itemised three strategies \u2013 first of which is to secure the licence for 5G. However, deploying the 5G network without pre-existing 3G or 4G infrastructure will be a tall order for the company.\n\nTherefore, the second strategy is to obtain 3G and 4G deployment licences. In doing this, it outlines two options. The first is to propose this to the NCC as support for the New Entrant National Carrier to provide diverse services. The second is to acquire an existing telco and use the acquired telco\u2019s existing infrastructure and licence in the delivery of 3G and 4G services.\n\nThe third strategy involves the acquisition of operational assets such as a full Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) architecture and modular data centres. NFV allows for the separation of communication services from dedicated hardware, such as routers and firewalls. This separation means network operations can provide new services dynamically and without installing new hardware.\n\nRead also: Mafab Communications, MTN face 4 hurdles ahead 5G deployment\n\nDeploying network components with network functions virtualisation takes hours instead of months, like with traditional networking. Also, the virtualised services can run on less expensive, generic servers instead of proprietary hardware.\n\nMafab, as well as MTN Nigeria, is required to pay the $273 million licence fee in naira at the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate. This may be the company\u2019s first major headache.\n\nThe naira is currently undergoing a period of high volatility. While the rate on the day the auction was concluded was N414, the naira has further weakened against the dollar ending the year on Friday, December 31, 2021, at N435 after the CBN adjusted the country\u2019s exchange rate on its website to N413.49 to a dollar.\n\nIn May, the apex bank devalued the naira from N379 to N411 per dollar after adopting the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window rate, also known as NAFEX rate.\n\nThe NAFEX rate, the official rate by the CBN, has oscillated between N414 and N415 in the past three months before the sudden fall to N435. The implication for Mafab is that if it had paid for the 5G licence on the day the announcement was made in naira at the prevailing CBN exchange rate as stipulated by the NCC, it would only have paid about N113 billion ($273 at N414 rate).\n\nExperts say the devaluation on December 31 may not be the last as the CBN could be using it as a strategy to balance the trade deficit. A country that imports more than it exports is likely to devalue its currency to reduce importation and thereby increase export.\n\nThis may not necessarily be to the advantage of Mafab and MTN, which would need to import most of the infrastructure they would need for the eventual deployment of 5G.\n\nAn expert, who pleaded anonymity, says Mafab\u2019s plan to raise equity is expected, but the concern for many investors would be how the company intends to pay back given that it is relatively new in the market and has little experience compared with its direct competitor, MTN Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company and backers are relatively untested. I hope it doesn\u2019t end up like Etisalat\u2019s $1.2 billion bad debt,\u201d the expert says.\n\nAnother expert notes that the intention to raise equity would mean that Mafab did not have the money for the licence in the first place, nevertheless, it still went ahead to participate in the auction and as far as raising the price to such an extent that a notable existing operator like Airtel Africa, which last bid was at $270 million, had to exit the auction paving the way for Mafab to emerge.\n\nThe company\u2019s subscriber growth projection also comes across as too ambitious, especially for the internet market segment. It projects the acquisition of 1.5 million subscribers in the first year. It plans to double the figure to 3 million subscribers in the second year and going on to achieve a 65 percent growth in the third year at 5 million. It expects the growth to slow by about 35 percent in the fourth year at 6 million and the fifth year at 7 million.\n\nFirst, it needs to be said that subscriber growth in the telecom industry in recent years is not what it used to be like in 2014 and 2015, when broadband penetration was at less than 20 percent. Subscriber growth started fluctuating widely in 2016, with established operators like MTN and 9Mobile (then Etisalat) seeing declines in data subscription. Globacom and Airtel, which gained, did not see the big growth margins from the previous years.\n\nWhile 2017 was a big year for MTN and Airtel, it wasn\u2019t for Globacom and 9Mobile, which continued to see declines. Globacom managed to turn the tide in 2018, joining the likes of MTN and Airtel, whereas 9Mobile stayed on the losing end.\n\nIn 2019, Globacom missed a slide into decline by the whiskers to again join MTN and Airtel on the gainers\u2019 table, but 9Mobile wouldn\u2019t bulge from losing. 2020 was another big year for all the telcos with the exception of 9Mobile. However, 2021 ended in red for all four operators.\n\nMafab\u2019s five-year growth projection may not have taken appropriate considerations of the current realities. Growth generally has slowed down in the industry driven by the country\u2019s poor economic condition, which has affected many subscribers\u2019 income levels.\n\nTeniola Olusola, national coordinator, Alliance for Affordable Internet, told BusinessDay that a scenario was being played out with the transaction proposal from Mafab.\n\nFirst, the proposal is not based on the company\u2019s track record as a telecom operator hence the big investors in Nigeria are not likely to come on board as they would consider the risk of backing a relatively unknown operator as too high.\n\nMafab would then need to turn its attention to foreign investors. Even then, the company would need to prove a strong economic case for 5G in Nigeria to get the support of the big investors.\n\nThe biggest cost for Mafab is not just settling the licence fee. The bigger expenditure begins with setting up infrastructure that will power the service it has got the licence for. While acquiring an existing telco may give it a head-start, it also comes with new challenges, like assuming control of the old telco\u2019s existing liabilities, including debt and operational inefficiencies.\n\nOtherwise, Teniola sees a scenario where Mafab is not able to meet up with the licence fee as a result of its inability to raise funding and putting the NCC in a tight corner of whether to conduct a fresh auction or issue the licence to Airtel, which was outbid.\n\nThe transaction proposal also notes that Mafab\u2019s parent company, Althani Group of Companies Limited, a company established 15 years ago, makes an annual turnover of over $450 million. The company also holds an operational interest in the banking, banking, insurance, hospitality, and telecom spheres of the Nigerian economy. Should the parent company decide to help offset the licence fee, would it not be exposing the other business interests?\n\n\u201cIn this endeavour, the company has enlisted Parallel Wireless Incorporated (PWL) and IPLOOK Technologies Co. Limited (IPLOOK) as technical partners. PWL is a telecom company in the US licensed to design and maintain cellular networks. The entity is the only US company challenging the world\u2019s legacy vendors with the industry\u2019s only unified software-enabled solution. IPLOOK is a Hong Kong company that acts as software and consulting house that will supply and install the 5G spectrum,\u201d the transaction document notes.",

          "text": "Nigeria hit a record-shattering daily count of 4,035 cases of COVID-19 on December 22, 2021, an 847 percent increase that many by error attributed to the rise of the fast-spreading omicron variant.\n\nThe rare surge was fuelled by backlogs aggregated largely from Lagos in previous days and others from Akwa-Ibom, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has said.\n\nAdetifa Ifedayo, NCDC director-general, in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay, said over 2,000 of those cases accrued from unreported cases in Lagos between December 13 and 19. Complementing it were backlogs from Akwa-Ibom between December 20 and 21.\n\nThe centre collates COVID-19 cases based on reports from states across the country daily, and cases reported daily are often an aggregate of positive results of PCR and rapid diagnostic tests done the previous day.\n\nBut sometimes and maybe slightly more frequently, some states report backlogs of cases that failed to come in before NCDC\u2019s typical reporting.\n\n\u201cLagos contributed most of those backlogs. As you know, Lagos literally had the most cases and they had a bit of struggle to keep up with the numbers and recording,\u201d Ifedayo said, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have 100 percent of states reporting every day. When that happens, the backlog can get added to whatever we finally report.\u201d\n\nDaily case counts and their waves have been one of the most observed indicators during the outbreak and have been a reliable early warning sign of severe disease and death in previous coronavirus waves.\n\nThe record-shattering surge of December 22 shifted worries over undercounting of COVID-19 cases to the question of whether the NCDC data now reflect the true scale of coronavirus incidence.\n\nAlthough reported cases are basically laboratory results of some tests and not an encompassing count of the cases in the country, it still leaves a view of the state of things.\n\nFor instance, BusinessDay analysis shows that despite the rise and fall of infections, there are no wide margins in the rate of testing in months that recorded the lowest confirmed cases and months when waves peaked.\n\nRead also: Afe Babalola University founder claims COVID herbal drug healed 19 patients\n\nBetween March 29 and May 2 last year, nearly 188,000 tests were done and 5,160 cases were confirmed. This was one of the periods of a steep decline in infections.\n\nOut of 236,709 tests done last November, just 2,131 cases were confirmed.\n\nDuring the peak of infection last December, there were 19,981 cases confirmed from 136,456 tests, based on the epidemiology reports released for three weeks.\n\nThe data indicate that while Nigeria\u2019s testing lags rates in some African countries, the positivity rate is still largely driven by COVID-19 variants and their capacity to spread.\n\n\u201cThe way we test has been fairly consistent and the patterns can be assumed to be reliable. They have been reliable enough for us to pick up when cases start to go up and when cases start to go down. Do they reflect the entire universe of cases we have? No. Even in places that test more, considering that a lot of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, they have far more cases than any country is able to actually report,\u201d the director-general said.\n\nOmicron began to dominate cases in the country from mid-November, overtaking Delta as the most common variant identified from genetic sequences, according to the NCDC.\n\nBy December, Nigeria had triggered a full-blown fourth wave of COVID-19 wave, which saw the NCDC pushing a campaign for responsible yuletide celebration.\n\nInterestingly, the wave is declining as quickly as it surged with less than 700 cases recorded daily since the start of 2022.\n\nThere are now indications that case counts might begin to lose their relevance as experts observing the disease say more attention should shift to the rate of hospital admissions than the rate of infections, which might leave little or no symptoms.\n\nLast month, 12,547 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized as some states reopened their isolation centres on the rising fourth wave.\n\nIt was similar in 2020 with 12,126 active cases being monitored.\n\nInstead, Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health centre at Columbia University, said at this stage of the pandemic, the focus should be \u201cshifting on preventing illness, disability and death, and therefore counting those,\u201d in a report.\n\nWith tests still largely privatised and profit-oriented, Nigeria might keep working with a partial view of the disease, which in any case has not been as brutal as seen in the US, for instance.",

He made reference to the frosty relationship between the state executive and the local government areas.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthose that talk of restructuring, I want them to define the concept. Do they want more states, at whose expense?\n\n\u201cI would not interfere with the work of the judiciary; Kanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary.

My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality. The term \u201ccritique\u201d is used in the cover of the work to show no malice is intended in writing it. After all, all mortals on earth and institutions have their high and low points. Only God is perfect, does not err and is omniscient.\n\n5.OBASEKI: THREE YEARS ON THE SADDLE (NOVEMBER 12, 2016- NOVEMBER 11, 2019)\n\nIt contains the activities of Obaseki in the three years of his first tenure in office as Governor of Edo State. Obaseki relied on his performance during this period as a launch pad for his re-election September 19, 2020.\n\n6.FIRST TENURE: CONSOLIDATED DIARY OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nThis is a compendium of all the plans, programmes and projects either executed or proposed by the administration of Obaseki during the four years of his first, concluded tenure as Governor on November 11, 2020.\n\n7.MILESTONES OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a body of work which highlights the official accomplishments of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies under Obaseki during the first year of his second tenure in office as Governor.\n\n8.SECOND TENURE: FIRST \u2013 YEAR HARVEST OF GOVERNOR GODWIN OBASEKI (NOVEMBER 12, 2020-NOVEMBER 11, 2021)\n\nIt is a detailed summary of the activities of Obaseki Government that is self-sufficient in facts and information arranged in chronological sequence of occurrence. When you read through this work, you are educated about all that the administration did in the first year of its second tenure.\n\n9.Proposed Plans, Programmes And Projects Of Obaseki Administration (2021 Edition)\n\nThe work lists 68 items on the shelf of Obaseki government that are ongoing or awaiting execution as at the last quarter of 2021.\n\nLast Work: All these works are apolitical. Therefore, they are not sponsored by any individual, group or political party. Rather, the works were put together by a team of researchers who believe passionately in providing resources material with which Edo citizens and other interested persons can get relevant facts about Edo State Government.\n\nMICHAEL A.

These serious investors are getting the needed attention.\u201d\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe are very much open to investments in manufacturing as the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration has made it clear that the state is ripe to be a manufacturing hub. So, we invite more persons to invest in Edo.\n\n\u201cAlready, enquiries we have received are for businesses interested in agro-processing, production of high-grade furniture, metal works and light manufacturing, among others. So, as a mix-purpose facility, we are open for business.\u201d\n\nA financial analyst and lecturer, Ikpomwonsa Nosakhare, said the new plant is sufficient incentive for investors to locate in the park, noting that power challenges constitute one of the major risks to investment in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe expect to see more companies trooping into the state as there is now steady source of electricity, which is not constrained by the challenges of the national grid. I am sure this is also enough to unlock more private capital to boost the state\u2019s real sector.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government has recorded a budget deficit of N7. 052 trillion in the eleven months ending November 2021, representing 33 per cent increase when compared with the N5.32 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, who disclosed this yesterday at the Public Presentation of 2022 budget, in Abuja, noted that deficit recorded represents 9.2 per cent above the N6.449 trillion aggregate deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe minister said that at the end of November, deficit spending had risen to N7.052 trillion, instead of the prorata figure of N 5.911 trillion.\n\nAhmed said the 2021 budget implementation report was provisional, capturing only the first 11 months, an indication that the deficit figure could be higher when the budget implementation report for the full year is concluded.\n\nAccording to her, as at November 2021, the federal government aggregate revenue was N5.51 trillion (74% of target), justified the deficit spending, as according to her, it would not have been possible for the economy to exit the recent recession without such a strategy.\n\n\u201cHaving witnessed two economic recessions we have had to spend our way out of recession, which contributed significantly to the growth in the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have been as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded partly by debt,\u201d she said.\n\nThe minister who gave details of the 2021 budget performance noted that the federal government share of oil revenues was N970.3 billion (representing 53% performance of the prorated sum in the 2021 budget).\n\n\u201cFGN share of non-oil tax revenues totalled N1.62 trillion (118.8% over and above the target). Companies Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) collections were N718.58 billion and N360.56 billion, representing 115% and 165% respectively of the prorata targets for the period,\u201d she said, noting that non-oil revenue exceeded its target of N1.488 trillion, as it recorded N1.621 trillion, showing a positive variance of N256.4 billion or 18. 8 per cent increase.\n\nOut of the N2.011 trillion oil revenue forecast in the 2021 budget, the sum of N1.843 trillion should have been realized as at the end of November. However, only N970.33 billion was recorded, indicating a shortfall of about 47 per cent.\n\n\u201cOn the expenditure side, N12.56 trillion (or 94.1%) has been spent out of the N13.57 trillion prorata budget. This performance is inclusive of expenditure estimates of the GOEs but exclusive of project-tied loans.\n\n\u201cOf the expenditure, N4.20 trillion was for debt service, and N3.02 trillion for Personnel costs, including Pensions.\n\n\u201cAs at November 2021, N3.40 trillion had been expended for capital. Of this, N2.98 trillion represents 83 per cent of the provision for MDAs\u2019 capital, N369.9 billion for Multilateral / Bilateral project-tied loans, and N49.52 billion as GOEs capital expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe minister was elated by growth in the non-oil sector, saying that the sector showed greater resilience, recording 5.44 per cent in real terms during the reference quarter (Q3 2021).\n\nShe said, \u201cIn real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 92.51 per cent to GDP in Q3 2021, higher from the share recorded in the Q3 2020 which was 91.27.\n\n\u201cAs at November, 2021, we had surpassed all collections for FGN independent revenues from 2017 to date. This reflects performance of our revenue growth initiatives for this revenue stream.\n\n\u201cWe have now for the first time surpassed the N1 trillion mark collection for independent revenues (N1.104 trillion collected as at November against a budget target of 973.41 billion). Analysts have always considered our projections unrealistic, but we have always insisted on the potentials that exist to grow FGN independent revenue.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Lawal, has however assured pensioners that funds for payment of the 24 months minimum wage pension arrears to military pensioners was included in the Board\u2019s year 2022 budget.\n\nCommodore Lawal disclosed this while reacting to series of protests by members of some military veteran groups.\n\nHe said though the protests have remained peaceful, the Board wished to appeal to its esteemed pensioners to desist from any further agitation as their demands are being addressed by relevant government agencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur esteemed military retirees would recall that in May 2021 the MPB notified them through a press release of my discussions with the Federal Ministry of Finance Budget and National Planning (FMFBNP) with regards to payment of all outstanding entitlements of military retirees as a result of the consequential adjustments on pensions occasioned by the New Minimum Wage Act, 2019.\n\n\u201cMy engagements with the Ministry paid off in June 2021 as funds were released to the Board for payment of shortfalls in gratuities of military retirees who retired/discharged from the Services between 18 April 2019 and 30 April 2021 as well as the implementation of the new pensions pay chart.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the shortfall in gratuities to deserving retired/discharged personnel were paid in July 2021, while all active retirees were placed on their new pension pay scale WEF May 2021 as directed by the President and Commander -in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is in this light that I wish to inform our esteemed retirees that the funds for payment of the 24 months minimum wage pension arrears to military pensioners is included in the Board\u2019s year 2022 budget estimates, currently under consideration at the National Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he informed retirees that the Board\u2019s year 2022 budget estimates have been successfully defended before relevant committees of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I would like to seize this opportunity to inform and assure all our esteemed pensioners that once the year 2022 budget is passed and assented to by Mr President, payments of the outstanding 24 months minimum wage pension arrears will commence.\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCommodore Lawal assured military retirees, Next of Kins (NOKs) and other well-meaning Nigerians that the Board remains resolute and will sustain the prompt payment of all entitlements due to military retirees or their NOKs.\n\nHe, therefore, urged them to continue to show understanding and patience and not to embark on any form of public protests or demonstrations as the issues at stake are receiving due attention.\n\nHe admonished that in the face of the current security situation in the country and the spread of a new variant of COVID-19 virus, gatherings of any sort in the name of protest of any kind should be discouraged by military pensioners and other stakeholders in the administration of military pensions.\n\nThe spokesperson of the group, Oamien Okhidievbie, said efforts to ensure their demands are met were rebuffed by the authorities.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe have had a series of meetings with the ministry of defense and every other party concerned, we were even supposed to have the protest before the ENDSARS.\n\n\u201cWe shelved it based on the assurance we received up till today that our demands have not been met. Come January 15 we are going to picket the ministry of finance and Defence should our entitlement be delayed further.\n\n\u201cHow can you not pay a debarment allowance, this is an allowance that discourages a soldier from using his skills against the country. I was in the special forces, I can create bombs , I can snip among others because of discipline I have decided not to use these skills against the country.\n\n\u201cLooking at the Health allowance is just a charade , it only takes care of malaria. I lost my sight while serving in the military. To manage myself I needed medication. A lot of retired personnel are ramshackled by health challenges.\n\n\u201cThe medically burdened veterans, their monies were slashed and no medical procedure for them to be treated and you\u2019re now depriving them from any kind of benefits.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also 24 months of arrears,we have also been following up on. How can you make minimum wage. We are ashamed that we have military veterans in the helm of affairs in the country and this is happening to us.This is going to cascade down to demoralizing the fighting troops.\u201d\n\nReceiving the veterans, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Aliyu Ahmed, assured them that their arrears would be paid.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe payment you are referring to is quite heavy. There was no way it could have been paid in 2021, so what we have done is to include it in the 2022 budget, the military pension board is aware that it is in the budget. I want to reassure you that as the custodian of the budget as soon as we settle in and start issuing the warrant you would get your money.\u201c",

          "text": "Pandora Papers: Inside the crime-infested life of Diezani\u2019s ally, Walter Wagbatsoma + How he was arrested, convicted in UK\n\nPandora Papers: Inside the crime-infested life of Diezani\u2019s ally, Walter Wagbatsoma + How he was arrested, convicted in UK\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, January 17, 2018, Nigerian businessman, Walter Wagbatsoma, was jailed and disqualified from being a company director for six years in the United Kingdom.\n\nBefore his conviction, Mr Wagbatsoma had been locked up for three years and six months for his part in an international conspiracy that swindled more than 13 million pounds from public services including Lincolnshire\u2019s mental health NHS trust.\n\nEarlier in June 2016, while travelling through Germany, he had been detained on a European Arrest Warrant and subsequently extradited and charged with conspiring with others to launder the proceeds of fraud through his business interests in the U.K.\n\nLeicester crown court said Mr Wagbatsoma personally benefited to the tune of 480,000 pounds from four fraud schemes, which saw him and his co-conspirators ring up hospitals, councils, schools, and housing associations posing as owners of a legitimate building firm that was owed money by the organisations.\n\nThe conspirators then claimed their bank details had changed and instructed the organisations to put the money into a different account instead. The money was subsequently moved around several accounts in a bid to make it untraceable.\n\nTagged Operation Tarlac, Lincolnshire Police\u2019s four-year investigation into the fraud ring began in 2011 after Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust was cheated out of \u00a31.28m.\n\nAt the time Mr Wagbatsoma was convicted in the United Kingdom, he was on a separate trial in Nigeria over fuel subsidy fraud.\n\nThe pieces of information about the businessman\u2019s several brushes with the law came from Pandora Papers, the landmark investigation into the vast amount of previously hidden offshore records of the super-rich and powerful, coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ.\n\nThe leaked records came from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients like Mr Wagbatsoma, who seek to conceal their financial activities.\n\n\u24d8\n\nThe investigation, which is the biggest collaboration of investigative journalists in history, involved 151 media outlets and more than 600 journalists from 117 countries who sifted through nearly 12 million leaked records, tracked down sources, and reviewed other public records.\n\nThe Man, Walter Wagbatsoma\n\nNamed Walter Omagbitse Wagbatsoma, the businessman and oil dealer was at a time an ally of arguably Nigeria\u2019s most influential minister of petroleum in recent history, Diezani Alison Madueke.\n\nMrs Alison-Madueke, believed to have moved to the United Kingdom after her exit from public office in Nigeria, ran the petroleum ministry that superintended over the opaque Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) between 2010 and 2015.\n\nShe served under the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan and has been named in a number of corruption trials since she left office.\n\nHer name has featured either as the main defendant or an accomplice in some cases filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nAccording to his Linkedin account, Mr Wagbatsoma bagged a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting and obtained a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from the University of Lagos.\n\nHe worked as a member of the Integrated Audit Department at Shell between 1991 and 1993 before joining Zenith Bank where he worked between 1993 and 2001.\n\n\u24d8\n\nHe also worked at FSB International Bank Plc between 2001 and 2003 before becoming executive vice-chairman of Ontario Oil and Gas Limited.\n\nMr Wagbatsoma and his companies\n\nDocuments seen by PREMIUM TIMES dated November 4, 2010, showed that Mr Wagbatsoma founded and became sole director of Ontario Resources and Trading Limited. The location of the company\u2019s registered office was set out in the Company\u2019s Memorandum and Articles of Association as Suite 15, 1st Floor Oliaji Trade Centre, Francis Rachel Street, P.O. Box 1004, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.\n\nLater in 2011, Mr Wagbatsoma became sole director and secretary of Mamlakah Energy Company Ltd, a company existing and operating under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.\n\nMr Wagbatsoma and Subsidy Fraud\n\nOn Wednesday, August 1, 2012, the EFCC arraigned Mr Wagbatsoma and other suspects implicated in the fuel subsidy scam before the Lagos High Court.\n\nOthers arraigned alongside the businessman were Adaoha Ugo-Ngadi, Fakuade Babafemi Ebenezer, Ezekiel Olaleye Ejidele, and Ontario Oil and Gas Nigeria Limited.\n\nThey were charged with obtaining property by false pretences, altering, forgery and conspiracy.\n\nThe case had been scheduled for a hearing a month earlier but was postponed due to Mr Wagbatsoma\u2019s failure to appear in court.\n\nAt the hearing, the EFCC informed the court that Mr Wagbatsoma had earlier fled the country to evade arrest upon learning of the charges filed against him. All efforts to arrest him were unsuccessful after he refused to honour invitations by the EFCC.\n\nThe EFCC said charges were first filed against Mr Wagbatsoma on July 20, 2012, but he claimed to have travelled out of the country on June 17, 2012, returning to the country on July 3, 2012, only to take off again on July 20 when he got wind of a charge filed against him before the court.\n\n\u201cA letter was received by the EFCC from the defendant\u2019s company, Ontario Oil and Gas Nigeria Limited that he was out of the country for medical check-up and will be available the moment he returns to the country. But that letter was dated 18th July 2012. So he was still very much in the country. These are some accounts of the deceit he employed to confirm that he was evading arrest. Up till now, we have not been able to obtain his statement. He left Abuja for France by 9 pm on the 20th July 2012 having got wind of this,\u201d the EFCC said at the time.\n\nIn May 2017, after a five-year trial, Justice Lateefa Okunnu of a Lagos High Court sentenced Mr Wagbatsoma to a minimum of 10 years in prison for the six-count charge brought against him by the EFCC.\n\nIn her judgment, Justice Okunnu sentenced the Managing Director of Ontario Oil and Gas Limited, Adaoha Ugo-Nnadi, to 10 years in prison for defrauding the Federal Government of N754 million in oil subsidy transactions.\n\nAt the time of that verdict, Mr Wagbatsoma was facing trial over a \u00a312 million National Health Service (NHS) Trust fraud in the United Kingdom.\n\nReported and Dumped\n\nAfter considering the crime-related controversies involving Mr Wagbatsoma and his companies, Alcogal, on June 5, 2013, wrote to the controversial businessman informing him that it was resigning as the registered agent for his companies. He was given 90 days to find a replacement.\n\nAlcogal also wrote BVI financial investigations agency of its decision to withdraw from managing Mr Wagbatsoma\u2019s companies -Pacesetter Trading Limited, Mamlakah Energy Company Limited and Alcamo International Limited.\n\nThe secrecy provider said associating with the tainted companies presented \u201chigher risk to our office than the risk tolerance levels currently set by our risk-based approach methodologies\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear if the businessman was eventually able to find another registered agent for his embattled firms.

          "text": "There are indications that Nigerians may begin to pay full price for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol as the federal government expressed its readiness to comply with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed said this during the public presentation of approved 2022 federal government budget Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on 31st December, 2021, signed the Appropriation Bill into law despite some worrisome injections by the National Assembly.\n\nThe PIA stipulates that the prices of all petroleum products shall be deregulated.\n\nAlready, the prices of diesel and kerosene, among others have long been deregulated.\n\nMinister explains\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, the minister said: \u201cFrom July to December, there is no provision made for subsidy. Our assumption is that by June, we would have been able to work through a process with all stakeholders, NOC, oil regulators, different MDAs that have a role to play as well as businesses. The PIA has made a provision that prices of products in the petroleum sector must be deregulated. And so far, we have been able to deregulate kerosene prices, diesel prices, the only one that is still not deregulated is PMS. We are trying to comply with the law because the PIA is an Act of the NASS and government has a responsibility to comply.\n\n\u201cAnd so, what do we do in terms of providing succour to mitigate the impact of the removal of fuel subsidy on the citizens. Maybe one of the things we should do is to provide a transport subsidy in form of N5,000 or any amount that may later be agreed. The idea is to provide subsidy in the hands of people that really need it. That is a proposal from the ministry along with other proposals and it will be discussed and everybody will agree on the one that is most practical and easier to implement, especially as we want to make sure that only the right people get the subsidy.\n\n\u201cOne other proposal that has been brought forward which is very key, is for us to identify through the transport workers union, commercial vehicles\u2019 drivers; get them registered and pass the subsidy through them using vouchers. So, there are several options that we are currently working on. The committee again and part of their work is to engage labour, so that we are able to comply with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act.\u201d\n\nThe 2022 budget is predicated on the following: Oil Price Benchmark 62/barrel; Oil Production (mbpd) 1.88; Exchange Rate (N/$) 410.15; Inflation rate 13%; N119.28 trillion; N184.38 trillion; and GDP Growth Rate 4.20%.\n\nDebt servicing\n\nOn debt servicing, Mrs Ahmed said the federal government is to spend N3.61 trillion to service its debt in 2022 fiscal year. The figure, according to estimates, accounts for 34 per cent of the 2022 projected budget.\n\nData from the Debt Management Office (DMO) published last year revealed that Nigeria\u2019s debt stood at N38trillion as of the end of September 30, 2021.\n\nDespite the rising debt profile, Mrs Ahmed insisted the country\u2019s debt was still within sustainable limit.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria\u2019s Debt Service/Revenue ratio (76% as at November 2021) is the highest among same African top economies; this is proof that what we have is not a classic debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge,\u201d she argued.\n\nAccording to the minister, projected aggregate revenue available to fund the 2022 budget of N10.74 trillion (inclusive of GOEs) is 32% higher than the 2021 projection of N8.12 trillion. Without the GOEs retained revenue, the FGN revenue is projected at N9.01 trillion.\n\nShe explained that to improve government revenue and entrench fiscal prudence, the ministry initiated the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives (SRGI).\n\nShe listed the initiatives to include: \u201cImproving the tax administration framework including tax filing and payment compliance improvements; Identifying and plugging existing revenue leakages to enhance tax compliance and reduce tax evasion; Leveraging technology and automation; and Plugging fiscal drainers like subsidies.\n\n\u201cTo further enhance Independent Revenue collection, Government aims to optimize the operational efficiencies and revenue generation focus of GOEs Introduction of new and further increases in existing pro heath taxes for example, excise on carbonated drinks.\u201d\n\nTax on non-alcoholic item, others\n\nShe further said part of the initiative to raise revenue for the government includes the imposition of a N10 per liter excise duty tax on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nThe excise duty tax is one of the amendments made in the Finance Act 2022 which was signed into law by President Buhari on December 31 last year.\n\nShe said the purpose of the additional tax was to discourage the consumption of excessive sugar among Nigerians, which, according to her, contributes to diabetes and obesity.\n\nThe minister further said the new measure was in line with the 2022 Budget priorities which enabled the government to introduce new sugar tax to raise revenue for health-related and other critical expenditures.\n\nAbout four million Nigerians suffer from diabetes linked to excess sugar consumption.\n\nNigeria ranks the 4th highest soft drink consuming country globally, with over 40 million litres sold yearly.",

Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Chinese Loans: Anybody That Will Help Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Is Welcome \u2013 Buhari\n\nIn November last year, President Buhari had promised to consider the request of some leaders from the South East region to release Kanu who is facing treason charges preferred against him by the Nigerian Government.\n\nAlthough he told the Igbo leaders under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats that they had made an extremely difficult demand, he insisted that the best thing was to subject the IPOB leader to the judicial system.\n\nIn his interview with Channels Television, the President doubted if Kanu was willing to return to the country to clear his name from the allegations against him after he fled in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is one institution that I wouldn\u2019t dare interfere with \u2013 that is the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cKanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary, but what I wonder is when Kanu was safely in Europe abusing this administration and mentioning too many things, I never thought really he wants to voluntarily come and defend himself on the accusations.\n\n\u201cSo, we are giving him an opportunity to defend himself in our system, not to be abusing us from Europe as if he was not a Nigerian. Let him come here to us and then criticise us here.\u201d\n\nImproved Security?\n\nApart from the trial of the IPOB leader, the President also spoke about a number of burning issues including security, economy, and politics, among others.\n\nHe began his interview with an assessment of his administration\u2019s performance since he assumed office in 2015, especially in the three key areas of security, improving the economy, and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians to be fair with this administration is to try and find out from the time we won the election in 2015 till now, in the three promises we made \u2013 improving security, improving the economy, and trying to fight corruption; securing the country in the North East, if you ask anybody from Borno State, from Yobe State, from Adamawa State, there are a number of local governments \u2013 about 18 \u2013 that were in the hands of Boko Haram, no local government now is strictly in the hands of Boko Haram or ISWAP. So, in that respect, we have done something,\u201d President Buhari asserted.\n\n\u201cIn the economy, don\u2019t forget and I challenge so many people to go and check with the central bank or NNPC. The production from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day. When we came, somehow the militants were unleashed in the South South.\n\n\u201cProduction went down to half a million barrels per day, and coincidentally, the price again collapsed to about $37 per barrel. But look at what we did within the time frame and the resources available to us relative to the government we inherited.\u201d\n\nDespite the gains made so far in improving the economy, the President is not happy with the present state of power because no country can develop without infrastructure, and infrastructure, for him, means road, rail, and power.\n\nHe, however, gave an assurance that his administration was working hard to bridge the gap, although the privatisation of the sector was another problem to worry about.\n\nChinese Loans\n\nPresident Buhari lamented that the owners of the distribution companies bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit, stressing that removing a system and reintroducing one was no joke.\n\nHe went on to defend his government\u2019s decision to source loans from China, saying anyone willing to help Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure was welcome.\n\n\u201cWe take that (loans) where it is necessary \u2026 we got the Chinese to help us in the rail and the roads, how can we turn that down? If we had turned that down maybe between Lagos to Ibadan, you will have to walk,\u201d the President said.\n\n\u201cSo, the Chinese are welcome, anybody that is prepared to come and help us and our infrastructure to do the roads, the rail, and power will be welcomed.\u201d\n\nIn the area of education, President Buhari told Nigerian youths to use their exposure to improve themselves and not see them as tickets to depend on the government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish when they go to school when they work hard when they earn their degree; they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs. You get educated because an educated person is certainly better than an uneducated person, even in identifying personal problems.\n\n\u201cSo, education is not just meant to hang on to the government to give you jobs and then what the colonialists indoctrinated in us to believe \u2013 have a car, have a house, start work by 8:00 am, and close by 2 pm.\u201d\n\nThe President also shared his political view where he said he was ready to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, if the National Assembly would include the options of consensus candidate and indirect primary to the mode of selecting a candidate for an election, as against the initial direct mode as the only option to conduct primaries by political parties.\n\nAsked if he will sign the bill if the lawmakers effect the change in that direction, he affirmed, \u201cYes, I will! I will sign.\n\n\u201cThere should be options, you can\u2019t dictate to people and say you are doing democracy. Give them other options so they can make a choice.\u201d",

Let them have three options \u2013 there is the consensus.\n\n\u201cPDP was so overconfident that they thought they would rule Nigeria till the end of time, but the opposition (parties) came together, and we overthrew them. Not as a result of direct primary, it is as a result of opposition parties coming together and fighting the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is because we agreed to come together. The fact that we came together gave us the success we had, and that was the mistake they made; that is why they lost.\u201d",

          "title": "UK to Scrap Pre-Departure Covid Tests for Fully Vaccinated from Friday",
          "text": "Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: \u201cI have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK.\u201d\n\nWhat are the current travel rules?\n\nCurrently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK.\n\nThey then have to take another test \u2013 which this time must be a PCR test \u2013 within the first two days after their arrival in the UK.\n\nBut at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 \u2013 and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid.\n\nBut UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant \u2013 so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to \u201ckeep out Omicron\u201d.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll feel unsafe on flights\u2019\n\nJohn Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nMr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid \u00a3212 each for PCR testing.\n\nHowever, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around \u00a330 per person and wasn\u2019t worth the added worry about new variants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,\u201d he said, adding that it would \u201cworsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life\u201d.\n\n\u00a3800 saving\n\nHowever, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around \u00a3400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another \u00a3400.\n\n\u201cHaving returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we\u2019ll be returning to the UK Covid free,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nCancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added.\n\nPeak booking period\n\nIn response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA \u2013 The Travel Association, said the two announcements were \u201cpotentially very positive\u201d for the travel sector, but that damage had \u201calready been done\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,\u201d he added.\n\nSteve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a \u201chuge difference\u201d. Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing \u201cexponentially\u201d after the rule change.\n\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a \u201ccritical booking window\u201d for the industry.\n\nEasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel \u201cmuch simpler and easier\u201d, as customers could now book and travel with \u201cconfidence\u201d.\n\nThe trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry.\n\nUK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid\n\nWhere will I need to use a Covid passport?\n\nWill Omicron stall airlines\u2019 recovery in 2022?\n\nAhead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron.\n\nIt said that passenger numbers at MAG\u2019s airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced.\n\nTim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme the research showed there was a \u201cbasis for taking out all tests\u201d related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn\u2019t be doing it and we should take those measures out,\u201d he added.\n\nSeparately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: \u201cWith so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it\u2019s likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.\u201d\n\nA recent report by aviation analytics firm Cirium found that the Covid pandemic triggered a 71% drop in international flights in and out of the UK in 2021.\n\nBBC",

The Recording Academy said it made the decision to postpone the ceremony \u201cafter careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners.\n\n\u201cGiven the uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant, holding the show on January 31st simply contains too many risks,\u201d the academy said in a statement.\n\nLast year, like most major awards shows in early 2021, the Grammys were postponed due to coronavirus concerns.

          "title": "Trump Maintains Grip on Republican Party Despite Violent Insurrection",
          "text": "As a raging band of his supporters scaled walls, smashed windows, used flagpoles to beat police and breached the U.S. Capitol in a bid to overturn a free and fair election, Donald Trump\u2019s excommunication from the Republican Party seemed a near certainty, his name tarnished beyond repair.\n\nSome of his closest allies, including Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham, warned that day that Trump was \u201cdestroying\u201d his legacy. \u201cAll I can say is count me out. Enough is enough,\u201d said his friend and confidant Sen. Lindsey Graham. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader who worked closely with Trump to dramatically reshape the judiciary, later denounced him as \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the attack.\n\nBut one year later, Trump is hardly a leader in exile. Instead, he is the undisputed leader of the Republican Party and a leading contender for the 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nTrump is positioning himself as a powerful force in the primary campaigns that will determine who gets the party\u2019s backing heading into the fall midterms, when control of Congress, governor\u2019s offices and state election posts are at stake. At least for now, there\u2019s little stopping Trump as he makes unbending fealty to his vision of the GOP a litmus test for success in primary races, giving ambitious Republicans little incentive to cross him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m horrendously disappointed,\u201d said former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a longtime Republican who now serves on the advisory committee of the Renew America Movement, a group trying to wrest the party away from Trump\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cHis ego was never going to let him accept defeat and go quietly into the night,\u201d she added. \u201cBut what I am surprised by is how deferential so many of the Republican elected officials\u201d have been.\n\nRather than expressing any contrition for the events of Jan. 6, Trump often seems emboldened and has continued to lie about his 2020 election loss. He frequently \u2014 and falsely \u2014 says the \u201creal\u201d insurrection was on Nov. 3, the date of the 2020 election when Democrat Joe Biden won in a 306-232 Electoral College victory and by a 7 million popular vote margin.\n\nFederal and state election officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general have said there is no credible evidence the election was tainted. The former president\u2019s allegations of fraud were also roundly rejected by courts, including by judges Trump appointed.\n\nUndaunted, Trump is preparing for another run for the White House in 2024, and polls suggest that, at the moment, he would easily walk away with the GOP nomination.\n\nFor Trump, the extraordinary outcome is the product of sheer will and a misinformation campaign that began long before the election, when he insisted the only way he could lose was if the election was \u201crigged\u201d and wouldn\u2019t commit to accepting defeat. His refusal to accept reality has flourished with the acquiescence of most Republican leaders, who tend to overlook the gravity of the insurrection for fear of fracturing a party whose base remains tightly aligned with Trump and his effort to minimize the severity of what happened on Jan. 6.\n\nWhile five people died during the rioting or its immediate aftermath, less than half of Republicans recall the attack as violent or extremely violent, according to a poll released this week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. About 3 in 10 Republicans said the attack was not violent.\n\nThe situation has stunned and depressed critics in both political parties who were convinced the insurrection would force Republicans to abandon the Trump era once and for all. He became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. The second impeachment centered on his role in sparking the insurrection, but Trump was acquitted in a Senate trial, a clear indication that he would face few consequences for his actions.\n\n\u201cThere was this hope when we were in the safe room that we would go back and the Republicans would see how crazy this was, how fragile our democracy was, what President Trump had done, and that they would renounce that and we would all come together,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., describing the events that day. Instead, she said, \u201cthere were people defending the insurrectionists and defending Trump and continuing with the challenge and the Big Lie.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, a Republican who, with Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, has emerged as one of the few GOP anti-Trump critics in Congress, had predicted Trump\u2019s hold on the party would \u201cbe gone\u201d by the summer. But Kinzinger, who recently announced his decision not to run for reelection, blamed House Republican leader and Trump ally Kevin McCarthy for proving him wrong.\n\n\u201cWhat I underestimated was the impact that one person would have on that, and that is Kevin McCarthy and his visit to Mar-a-Lago,\u201d Kinzinger said, referring to a trip McCarthy took to Florida in late January 2020 as the party was on the verge of disarray. With their eyes on retaking the House in 2022, Trump and McCarthy agreed to work together and released a photograph showing them smiling side by side.\n\n\u201cKevin McCarthy is legitimately, singlehandedly the reason that Donald Trump is still a force in the party,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cThat full-hearted embrace, I saw firsthand in members, made them not just scared to take on Trump but in some cases also full-heartedly embrace him.\u201d\n\nAides to McCarthy didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Kinzinger\u2019s characterization.\n\nOthers, however, point to fractures that suggest Trump\u2019s power is waning.\n\nBanned from Twitter and denied his other social media megaphones, Trump no longer controls the news cycle like he did in office. He canceled a news conference that was scheduled for Thursday following pressure from some Republican allies, who warned that such an event was ill-advised.\n\nDuring last year\u2019s most prominent elections, Republicans like Virginia gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin strategically kept Trump at arm\u2019s length. Youngkin\u2019s victory created a possible model for candidates running in battleground states where suburban voters uncomfortable with the former president are a key bloc.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s endorsement remains coveted in many midterm primary races, it has also failed to clear the field in some key races. Trump has similarly struggled to prevent other Republicans from eyeing the 2024 presidential nomination. His former vice president, secretary of state and a handful of Senate allies have made frequent trips to early voting states, preparing for potential campaigns and refusing to rule out running against Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody walks out of the most powerful office in the world, the Oval Office, to sit by the swimming pool at Mar-a-Lago, his influence declines,\u201d said John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. Bolton has funded extensive national and state-level polling on the subject over the last year that has found Trump\u2019s sway and the power of his endorsement waning considerably since he left office.\n\n\u201cI really think that the evidence is clear that the people are done with Trump,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cHe still has support, but it is declining. Honestly, it\u2019s not declining as fast as I would like to see and it\u2019s not down to zero. But among real people, it is declining.\u201d\n\nTrump is also facing a flurry of investigations, including in New York, where prosecutors are investigating whether his real estate company misled banks and tax officials about the value of his assets, inflating them to gain favorable loan terms or minimizing them to reap tax savings. New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office confirmed this week that it has subpoenaed Trump and his two eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., as part of an investigation into the family\u2019s business practices. Both children have been prominent political surrogates for Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the Jan. 6 committee continues to investigate the Trump White House\u2019s involvement in the deadly insurrection.\n\nTrump still has his eyes on 2024, even as he continues to obsess over the 2020 election. After spending 2021 raising money and announcing his endorsements of candidates who have parroted his election lies up and down the ballot, Trump\u2019s team is preparing to pivot to helping those candidates win with a stepped-up rally schedule and financial support, including transfers to candidate accounts and targeted advertising.\n\nTrump, according to allies, sees the midterms as a foundation for his next campaign, and intends to use the cycle to position himself for his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nVoting rights advocates, meanwhile, are increasingly worried as states with Republican legislatures push legislation that would allow them to influence or overrule the vote in future elections. They fear what might happen if Trump-endorsed candidates for secretary of state and attorney general who say the election was stolen find themselves in positions that could sway the outcome in 2024.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concerted effort to undermine our public\u2019s confidence in the electoral system, so in 2022 and 2024, if they don\u2019t like the elections \u2014 and this is Republicans \u2014 they can overturn it,\u201d said Whitman, who also serves as co-chair of States United Action, a nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to protect the integrity of future elections. \u201cWe are in a very, very fragile place.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP",

          "title": "North Korea Launches Second Hypersonic Missile in Fiery Test",
          "text": "North Korea fired a \u201chypersonic missile\u201d this week that successfully hit a target, state news agency KCNA reported on Thursday, its second such test as the country pursues new military capabilities amid stalled denuclearisation talks.\n\nThe launch on Wednesday was the first by North Korea since October and was detected by several militaries in the region, drawing criticism from governments in the United States, South Korea, and Japan. North Korea first tested a hypersonic missile in September, joining a race headed by major military powers to deploy the advanced weapons system. Hypersonic weapons usually fly towards targets at lower altitudes than ballistic missiles and can achieve more than five times the speed of sound \u2013 or about 6,200 km per hour (3,850 mph).\n\nDespite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed \u2013 which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads \u2013 but their manoeuvrability. In Wednesday\u2019s test, the \u201chypersonic gliding warhead\u201d detached from its rocket booster and manoeuvred 120 km (75 miles) laterally before it \u201cprecisely hit\u201d a target 700 km (430 miles) away, KCNA reported. The missile demonstrated its ability to combine \u201cmulti-step glide jump flight and strong lateral manoeuvring,\u201d KCNA said. The test also confirmed components such as flight control and its ability to operate in the winter, KCNA added.\n\n\u201cThe successive successes in the test launches in the hypersonic missile sector have strategic significance in that they hasten a task for modernizing strategic armed force of the state,\u201d the KCNA report said. While it has not tested nuclear bombs or long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, in recent years North Korea has developed and launched a range of more manoeuvrable missiles and warheads likely aimed at being able to overcome missile defences like those wielded by South Korea and the United States, analysts have said. \u201cMy impression is that the North Koreans have identified hypersonic gliders as a potentially useful qualitative means to cope with missile defence,\u201d said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. NEW MISSILE\n\nHypersonic weapons are considered the next generation of arms that aim to rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms. Last month the United States completed construction of a massive, $1.5 billion long-range radar for a homeland missile defence system in Alaska that it says can track ballistic missiles as well as hypersonic weapons from countries such as North Korea. Photos of the missile used in Wednesday\u2019s test show what analysts said is a liquid-fueled ballistic missile with a conical-shaped Manoeuvrable Reentry Vehicle (MaRV) blasting off from a wheeled launch vehicle in a cloud of flame and smoke. It is a different version than the weapon tested last year, and was first unveiled at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang in October, Panda said.\n\n\u201cThey likely set up at least two separate development programmes,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of these was the Hwasong-8, which was tested in September. This missile, which shares a few features in common with the Hwasong-8, is another.\u201d In a call with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the North Korea missile launch and discussed cooperation to achieve complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. \u201cWe take any new capability seriously, and as we\u2019ve said, we condemn (North Korea\u2019s) continued testing of ballistic missiles, which are destabilizing to the region and to the international community,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said later. Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal have been stalled since a series of summits between leader Kim Jong Un and then-U.S. President Donald Trump broke down with no agreement.",
