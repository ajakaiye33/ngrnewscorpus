          "title": "PANDEF faults planned establishment of naval base in Kano",
          "text": "The Pan Niger Delta Forum has decried the approval of a naval base in Kano State, saying the move is one of the biases by the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH in a telephone interview on Sunday, PANDEF spokesman, Ken Robinson, said it was funny for any person to consider establishing a naval base in a desert.\n\nThe Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, had asked for the visibility of the Nigerian Navy to strengthen security in the state, a request that led to the approval of the establishment of a naval base in the state.\n\nRobinson said, \u201cIt is one of the funny things going on in this country. When you create a naval base in Kano, we hope that they will move all the vessels and the warships and protect the territorial deserts of Nigeria with the war vessels, and perhaps mitigate the activities of bandits and terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis government is a funny government. This country is so funny. We leave the things that are necessary and politicise everything. But this situation will not continue forever; a day will come when it will end; and we think that that day is close.\u201d\n\nAsked if federal character could be one of the considerations for the decision to create a naval base in the northern state, Robinson maintained that such a consideration was wrong.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhat is federal character in establishing a naval base when you cannot adhere to federal character in appointments? Out of 17 top military, paramilitary and intelligence agencies in the country, 14 heads of those agencies are from the North.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think of federal character in appointment, but you are thinking of federal character in infrastructure allocation. When they established military universities in the North, did they consider federal character?\n\n\u201cThe NDA is in the North; all military institutions are in the North. This country is a funny country. The Buhari administration has raised the bar to an unbelievable and unprecedented level in terms of this nepotism.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the agenda to transfer all military structures; if it were possible for them, they will create water in the desert and then take all the vessels to the North. Fortunately, nature will not allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nRobinson explained that most policies of the current regime had defied global standards of considerations, adding, \u201cAll their policies are coloured in terms of discrimination and biases.\n\n\u201cSo, we are not even surprised; they can take everything they like to the North; to Kano, Kaduna, and perhaps to Bauchi and Borno states.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "NEF kicks over imposition of restrictions on northern communities",
          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum, on Sunday, picked holes in the actions taken by some state governments to check insecurity, describing them as \u201cvirtual economic and social lockdown on people who have been at the mercy of criminals for a long time.\u201d\n\nSuch measures, according to the forum, include the suspension of weekly markets, restrictions on the sale of petrol, closure of schools and some roads, imposition of curfews, restriction in the movement of cattle and other animals, as well as plans to restrict communication.\n\nThe Director, Media and Publicity, NEF, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, who made the observations in a statement titled, \u2018Security of besieged communities\u2019, warned that such restrictions would compound the desperate conditions of living of many communities in the North.\n\nAccording to him, unless they are accompanied by an aggressive and effective assault on the banditry and kidnapping industry, they will merely add to the misery and hopelessness of the communities.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe Northern Elders Forum is closely following the condition of many northern communities that have become particularly vulnerable to attacks and abuse by bandits, kidnappers and related organised criminals.\n\n\u201cMeasures being taken by some state governments such as suspension of weekly markets, restrictions on sale of petrol, closure of schools and some roads, curfews, movement of cattle and plans to restrict communication will compound the desperate conditions of living of many communities in the North.\n\n\u201cWhile it will be unhelpful to criticise these measures without adequate knowledge of their potential to relieve the desperation under which people live, it is important nevertheless to demand that those who have powers to impose them also have clear ideas over what they could achieve and when.\n\n\u201cThese measures represent virtual economic and social lockdowns on people, who have been at the mercy of criminals for a long time. Unless they are accompanied by an aggressive and effective assault on the banditry and kidnapping industry, they will merely add to the misery and hopelessness of our communities.\n\n\u201cWorse, they could further embolden the bandit and the kidnappers when it becomes clear that governments and security agencies cannot go beyond lockdowns on the communities.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cCommunities themselves will lose even more faith in the capacity of the Nigerian state to respond to their desperate circumstances. The perception that communities are on their own must never be allowed to take deeper roots, but it will, when people see only the bandits and the kidnappers winning.\n\n\u201cThe forum calls on the Federal Government to assist states to relieve communities that are now living under additional pressures. State governments imposing additional hardships on communities must know that the measures they are introducing must produce tangible results within a period that makes them meaningful and tolerable.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Tito Obaigbo: Promoting Reading Culture",
          "text": "Tito Obaigbo, Founder and President of the Smart Book Club (SBC), is a prolific reader, with an undying love for books. An MSC graduate of Development Economics from the University of Manchester, United Kingdom, and an MBA from the University of Lagos, Obaibgo who also holds a degree in Agriculture from the University of Agriculture Abeokuta, began her career as a Banker and worked for over a decade before leaving to pursue her passion and love for books.\n\nToday, she runs Oakhill Group of Companies comprising Oakhill Books, Oakhill Mart, Oakhill Schools and Oakhill Gardens. Creating the Smart Book Club she says, stems from the need to encourage the dying reading culture in Nigeria, while bringing together a select group of Seasoned, Mindful, Articulate, Resourceful and Tenacious ( S.M.A.R.T) female avid readers, to connect, empower and build a network of powerful women via Literature, social events, and community service. The educationist, who has written several articles for newspapers and magazines, as well as articles for journal publication, recently bagged the Tutuola Palm for Poetry Awards and conferred with the title, DAME at this year\u2019s edition of the Lagos Book Convention \u2013 the Third Annual Literary Extravaganza.\n\nThe mother of two from Ekiti State, talks to Allure about receiving this prestigious award, her love for books, vision and mission for women among other things.\n\nYou recently received the Tutuola Palm for Poetry Awards, what does that mean to you?\n\nI am honoured, grateful and overwhelmed with joy. It is a huge honour to receive such a prestigious award. I am filled with so much joy.\n\nWhat does being a Dame mean to you?\n\nBeing a dame is a huge honour, and it is a great task for you to be called a Dame. I received it with a lot of appreciation and gratitude to God. It also shows that hard work pays and it encourages you to do better. So, I am indeed honoured to be called a Dame.\n\nHaving been conferred with such an award, will that put any kind of pressure on you, in terms of your work?\n\nIt will spike me to do better because the sky is just the beginning. It means that I need to work harder and do better. Knowing that what you are doing is being recognized, gives one so much joy and encourages one to do better. I was just doing my own thing in my little corner and here we are today, receiving such a prestigious award. A lot is expected as a Dame and I will live up to it.\n\nWhat is your view about the awards itself?\n\nThe organisers have been doing such an amazing job, and receiving the awards did not come that easily. I had to submit a lot of reports; it involved a lot of writing and all that was scrutinized and here we are. I must applaud them for what they have done. We need to encourage them because a lot of people see writing or reading as something that is boring; but there is a lot of good that comes out of it. Reading, writing, creative arts is life, arts is life so, we need to continue to encourage art, encourage writing, and encourage the younger ones, especially the youths of today to imbibe the culture of reading.\n\nWhat informed the creation of the Smart Book Club and would you say the objective has been achieved?\n\nIt began 3 years ago precisely on the 1st of April 2018 when Smart Book Club was formerly founded. I have always had the notion that Nigerians do not really have the knack for reading, most especially Nigerian women. Taking us back to when I was a Branch Manager in one of the Commercial Banks in Nigeria over 10years ago, my boss then, loved to read and would encourage all Branch Managers to read. But because I loved to read too, we would talk about bestsellers and the latest books, then after reading a book, I would then do a critical review of the book for him. When I went on vacation abroad, I would visit different book stores. I always wanted to be ahead of my boss in terms of reading different genres of books. So, I would ask for the hottest and latest books on the shelf.\n\nI also encouraged all my team members in the branch to buy at least one book in a month to read. As a matter of fact, I got a bookseller to source the books for us, so that made it easy for us to get all genres of books. I remember the first book I recommended was Who moved my Cheese written by Dr. Spencer Johnson followed by David and Goliath, The underdogs, misfits and the art of battling giants by Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nWhen I left the bank to pursue my own business and further my education, I then spoke to my friend Mrs. Adaeze Kingsley-Anyanwu, who is now our Vice-President, and another friend then about reading a book every month and meeting up at nice restaurants to unwind and review the book we read. We tried a few times to meet but, we just couldn\u2019t agree to meet. The third person was just starting his export business and was always out of the country, so the arrangement just died a natural death, this was around 2013/2014.\n\nThen 4 years later in 2018, with the advent of social media platforms especially WhatsApp and Instagram, I got the vision again and this time, it was clearer in terms of structure and modalities. I called my sister, Mrs. Yemi Ogunlewe who is now our Publicity Secretary and a few other friends and I set up the chatroom, and started inviting friends. Most of us who started with me, have remained in the club till date. Members then invited their friends too and today, we have built long-lasting sisterhood connections.\n\nThe book club is basically for women alone, why is that? And how has it been over the years?\n\nWell, we decided to limit it to women so that members would be more comfortable. I thought about those days when our mothers would have meetings. When it was my mum\u2019s turn to host the meeting, we would cook and cook. I used to dread those days. However, the beauty of the Association or peer group meetings then was the sisterhood connections that they built. They would rally around members when celebrating birthdays, naming ceremonies, burials etc. They would all wear the same attire or would wear the same colour. I think that was where the popular Aso-ebi came from. So I wanted women to be women and build sisterhood connections instead of women tearing each other down. So far, it has been a beautiful journey supporting members and being there for one another. It\u2019s been awesome. By the grace of God, we have over 50 women in the club.\n\nTalk to us about your love for books and when you started reading?\n\nI have always loved books. I guess I was a bookworm in school. I also loved fashion. I was the assistant Head Girl back in Secondary School. I attended the legendary Queens School, Ibadan. I have a way of balancing books, fashion and fun. I read when I needed to and had fun when I needed to. I guess I have always loved reading right from my primary school days. When I grew older, I developed this passion for research work. I always love to proffer probable solutions to problems. I have written several articles for newspapers and magazines too. I have also written articles for journal publication.\n\nHow do you feel about your initiative now and would you say it\u2019s making the impact you hoped for at the outset?\n\nThe response has been phenomenal. Everyone says, it\u2019s a new development and a laudable one. We have also had recognition locally and internationally. Authors and publishers write to us and donate lots of copies of their books to us, just to read and review. Authors reach out to us to please pick their books for our next book pick. It\u2019s been rewarding and encouraging.\n\nWhich is your all time favourite book?\n\nMy all time favourite book is From Third World to First, The Singapore Story: 1965 \u2013 2000 written by Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nWhat is your take on the reading culture of Nigerians especially the youths in this era of social media?\n\nThe reading culture in Nigeria is gradually eluding. Many Nigerians are not reading, especially women and youths. Nigerians do not have the knack for reading; we saw the gap and reason why we set up the Smart Book Club for women to help them imbibe that habit of reading. There\u2019s a saying that if you want to keep any information away from a Nigerian, you should put it in writing.\n\nIn Smart Book Club, we read one book a month and at the end of the month, we meet at a nice restaurant to review the book. The review meetings are always a good way of networking, where you get to meet different amazing and strong women from varying fields of expertise. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been meeting virtually. Aside from the one-book-a-month, we also encourage women to have personal targets for reading: 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 books to be read in a year. It is a daunting task considering that women are already burdened with work and, or home responsibilities. But, it is achievable if we put our minds to it, and make use of any available time slots to read. Therefore, we give tips on how to find time slots out of our busy schedules as women to read. We also have amongst us, young ladies who usually tend to have many activities in their lives that distract them, so we give those tips and guide them on how to create time to read. Knowledge derived from reading can never be taken away. The beautiful and most wonderful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.\n\nHow is your association trying to effect a change in the minds of people when it comes to reading? Are you doing anything in that line?\n\nIn order to help our youths imbibe that culture of reading, we have a project that is very dear to our hearts. It is called Project School Library (PSL). What we do is that we go to public schools to donate books, school bags, stationery, personal protective equipment (PPE), toiletries, and sanitary towels to all students and cash gifts to the best students in class. We also donate gifts to their teachers to encourage them. We donate books to their libraries. We give them pep talks during their school assembly from time to time, and classroom book reading to Nursery and Primary school pupils.\n\nWe believe very strongly that, to imbibe the habit of reading, we need to catch them young, hence, we take the PSL project very seriously in the Smart Book Club.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your personal style now. What is fashion like for you?\n\nFashion for me is effortless because I go for comfort and what suits my body type. I have eyes for good things too. I love fashion, which comes naturally and effortlessly for me. I must say I got my knack for fashion from my mother. She is one of the most beautiful women on earth. Also, because I\u2019m a plus-size diva, I opened a plus-size shop for women in the year 2009 called Max Woman. I advocate that whilst we are eating right and exercising, we should embrace our curves. It\u2019s the only body I\u2019ve got, so I carry my body with grace and I love every curve created by God on my body.\n\nI love jewelry too and have a weakness for fragrances. l probably have over 100 bottles of perfumes.\n\nMy favourite colour is purple, right from my Primary School days. These days, I\u2019m just falling head over heels for the colour yellow.\n\nAre you a foodie, what is your favourite food?\n\nI don\u2019t really have a favourite food as I\u2019m not a foodie, but I can say, I love plantain- fried, roasted or boiled. I also love grilled Salmon.\n\nTell us what we don\u2019t know about you?\n\nI\u2019m a lover of plants, especially Cacti and Succulents. I also hold workshops on the care of plants and how plants can purify and at the same time, beautify our environment through the process of photosynthesis. I have been to several schools, teaching students how to grow their own small vegetables in their backyards. I have also been working on some short documentaries and movies. Hopefully, we will get the production up to speed soon.\n\nWhat do you have to say to today\u2019s women?\n\nWomen are fantastic and wonderful beings, we want to continue to encourage women to read. We want our women to have a sense of belonging, being part of what is happening. Women are clamouring for inclusion, we need to give ourselves the prerequisite skills, to be included in what is happening in the world globally, in Nigeria, our community, and around us in our society. Women should continue to aspire to get more knowledge. Knowledge is power, it\u2019s yours and no one can take it from you. Reading broadens your horizon and frontiers. It gives you a bigger, clearer, and broader perspective to life. The secrets of making good success in life, businesses, marriage, finance, governance, etc are all embedded in books. Have you stopped to ask yourself why all legends, past presidents, billionaires, history makers, heroines, heroes etc have either written a book or people have written books about them? Trust me, they are all avid readers and that\u2019s why they are successful. So we are saying, women should continue to imbibe that culture of reading and also encourage their children to read. It is very important.",

I have also written articles for journal publication.\n\nHow do you feel about your initiative now and would you say it\u2019s making the impact you hoped for at the outset?\n\nThe response has been phenomenal. Everyone says, it\u2019s a new development and a laudable one. We have also had recognition locally and internationally. Authors and publishers write to us and donate lots of copies of their books to us, just to read and review. Authors reach out to us to please pick their books for our next book pick. It\u2019s been rewarding and encouraging.\n\nWhich is your all time favourite book?\n\nMy all time favourite book is From Third World to First, The Singapore Story: 1965 \u2013 2000 written by Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nWhat is your take on the reading culture of Nigerians especially the youths in this era of social media?\n\nThe reading culture in Nigeria is gradually eluding. Many Nigerians are not reading, especially women and youths. Nigerians do not have the knack for reading; we saw the gap and reason why we set up the Smart Book Club for women to help them imbibe that habit of reading. There\u2019s a saying that if you want to keep any information away from a Nigerian, you should put it in writing.\n\nIn Smart Book Club, we read one book a month and at the end of the month, we meet at a nice restaurant to review the book. The review meetings are always a good way of networking, where you get to meet different amazing and strong women from varying fields of expertise. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have been meeting virtually. Aside from the one-book-a-month, we also encourage women to have personal targets for reading: 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 books to be read in a year. It is a daunting task considering that women are already burdened with work and, or home responsibilities. But, it is achievable if we put our minds to it, and make use of any available time slots to read. Therefore, we give tips on how to find time slots out of our busy schedules as women to read. We also have amongst us, young ladies who usually tend to have many activities in their lives that distract them, so we give those tips and guide them on how to create time to read. Knowledge derived from reading can never be taken away. The beautiful and most wonderful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.\n\nHow is your association trying to effect a change in the minds of people when it comes to reading? Are you doing anything in that line?\n\nIn order to help our youths imbibe that culture of reading, we have a project that is very dear to our hearts. It is called Project School Library (PSL). What we do is that we go to public schools to donate books, school bags, stationery, personal protective equipment (PPE), toiletries, and sanitary towels to all students and cash gifts to the best students in class. We also donate gifts to their teachers to encourage them. We donate books to their libraries. We give them pep talks during their school assembly from time to time, and classroom book reading to Nursery and Primary school pupils.\n\nWe believe very strongly that, to imbibe the habit of reading, we need to catch them young, hence, we take the PSL project very seriously in the Smart Book Club.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your personal style now. What is fashion like for you?\n\nFashion for me is effortless because I go for comfort and what suits my body type. I have eyes for good things too. I love fashion, which comes naturally and effortlessly for me. I must say I got my knack for fashion from my mother. She is one of the most beautiful women on earth. Also, because I\u2019m a plus-size diva, I opened a plus-size shop for women in the year 2009 called Max Woman. I advocate that whilst we are eating right and exercising, we should embrace our curves. It\u2019s the only body I\u2019ve got, so I carry my body with grace and I love every curve created by God on my body.\n\nI love jewelry too and have a weakness for fragrances. l probably have over 100 bottles of perfumes.\n\nMy favourite colour is purple, right from my Primary School days. These days, I\u2019m just falling head over heels for the colour yellow.\n\nAre you a foodie, what is your favourite food?\n\nI don\u2019t really have a favourite food as I\u2019m not a foodie, but I can say, I love plantain- fried, roasted or boiled. I also love grilled Salmon.\n\nTell us what we don\u2019t know about you?\n\nI\u2019m a lover of plants, especially Cacti and Succulents. I also hold workshops on the care of plants and how plants can purify and at the same time, beautify our environment through the process of photosynthesis. I have been to several schools, teaching students how to grow their own small vegetables in their backyards. I have also been working on some short documentaries and movies. Hopefully, we will get the production up to speed soon.\n\nWhat do you have to say to today\u2019s women?\n\nWomen are fantastic and wonderful beings, we want to continue to encourage women to read. We want our women to have a sense of belonging, being part of what is happening. Women are clamouring for inclusion, we need to give ourselves the prerequisite skills, to be included in what is happening in the world globally, in Nigeria, our community, and around us in our society. Women should continue to aspire to get more knowledge. Knowledge is power, it\u2019s yours and no one can take it from you. Reading broadens your horizon and frontiers. It gives you a bigger, clearer, and broader perspective to life. The secrets of making good success in life, businesses, marriage, finance, governance, etc are all embedded in books. Have you stopped to ask yourself why all legends, past presidents, billionaires, history makers, heroines, heroes etc have either written a book or people have written books about them? Trust me, they are all avid readers and that\u2019s why they are successful. So we are saying, women should continue to imbibe that culture of reading and also encourage their children to read. It is very important.",

          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nYesterday, history was made as the Itsekiri people trooped out en masse and converged in their ancestral home, Ode-Itsekiri popularly called big Warri, to crown their new king. Known for their elegant and flamboyant dressing, the Itsekiri put up the finest of their rich culture and tradition as colourful boat regattas displayed on Warri high seas, an event specially reserved for special occasions such as the coronation of a king, preceded the coronation rights.\n\nPHOTO By: Henry Unini\n\nPrince Tsola Emiko, who, until yesterday was referred to as Omoba, after spending 90 days in seclusion in which he was educated on Itsekiri culture and custom, as well as kingship etiquettes was crowned the 21st Olu of Warri after picking the royal title of Ogiame Atuwatse III.\n\nBorn Utienyinoritsetsola Emiko in Warri, Delta State, on April 2, 1984, to Prince Godwin Toritseju Emiko, the late Ogiame Atuwatse II, and Gladys Durorike Emiko, he had his early education at Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Primary School and Adesoye College in Offa, Kwara State between 1995 and 2000.\n\nIn 2002, he then proceeded to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and Political Science with minors in History and Economics.

It\u2019s your Thanksgiving ceremony today. What are you most grateful for?\n\nLife. Health and a dream come true.\n\nYesterday, history was made in Itsekiri land. As the person at the center, what was the whole experience like for you?\n\nIt was dreamlike, surreal, and inspirational for myself and many others who I\u2019m sure are encouraged that something promised, no matter the obstacles or setbacks, that it can, and will, come to pass.\n\nYesterday\u2019s colourful ceremony is a testament of the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people. How and in what ways do you intend to continue this legacy?\n\nI think we witnessed some new things that we introduced by way of organization, procession, music and visuals in the ceremony. Those are a testament of many more additions to come. I plan to do many unprecedented things that will enhance, and promote, the rich heritage of the Itsekiri people.\n\nYour father and grand father were Olus who reigned long and enjoyed the love and support of the Itsekiri people. Do you fear if their shoes might be too big for you to fill?\n\nWell, certainly, they\u2019ve left huge boots to fill. However, I know that God\u2019s hand is very much in my ascension to the throne. The same One who saw it fit to put me here will keep me, and help me to lead and serve the people He has called me to.\n\nIf HM Atuwatse were here, what would he be most proud of?\n\nHe would be proud that I trusted God. I kept my peace and pursued peace. He always said a baby elephant doesn\u2019t struggle to grow. Without struggling, here we are.\n\nOne of the things you had going for you was the fact that you grew up in kingship and had the privilege of seeing your late father administer his kingdom. What was it like growing up in the palace as a young prince?\n\nTo be honest, it was a very normal household. My parents did their best to keep us \u201cgrounded\u201d and raise us just like any other children. They were intentional, to ensure that we didn\u2019t grow up proud or entitled because of our status. However, as they say, greatness is never taught, it is caught. While nothing was formally taught, I observed everything about my father: his unwavering love for his people, his ethics, his integrity, his speech, his demeanor and his carriage. I like to believe I caught all these principles from him.\n\nWhat fascinated you most?\n\nThe grace by which he appeared to carry it all with so much ease and poise.\n\nAs a king in a digital age, how do you hope to cope with the rigid demands of culture and tradition?\n\nTechnology is here to make our lives as a race easier. So, we will find ways to apply technology to enhance and ease our already numerous responsibilities. Open mindedness and willingness to adapt will make all the difference.\n\nYour journey to the throne was quite a stormy one. What was it like being in the center of it all?\n\nTo quote a song, \u201cIn the eye of the hurricane, there is quiet\u201d. There was a certain peace I had in the eye of the storm. A peace I still very much have.\n\nNow that the storm is over, what plans do you have to bring all Itsekiris together again as one?\n\nNo victor, no vanquished. We are one big body, and there are different parts that have different functions: we will ensure those suited to roles are given those roles; and a giant toe that feels it\u2019s so prominent because of whatever blessings it has, shouldn\u2019t feel it must be the center of the forehead because it\u2019s a giant in its sense. Everyone has a role to play, and we will ensure those roles are well applied. We will function together as one to bring progress and development to our kingdom.\n\nOne major problem facing Itsekiris is community crises, you also have crises between youths of the three major ethnic groups in Warri. What plans do you have to ensure a permanent end to these crises?\n\nFor a people to co-exist, there must be mutual respect for each other as individuals. Mutual respect for each other\u2019s boundaries, customs and culture. It\u2019s a shared environment, we should see our problems as the same. We should also see our development as a shared and mutually intertwined one. That way, we are invested in ensuring there is peace all around. I am a man of peace and I will seek to bring peace and unity between the Itsekiris and our neighbours.\n\nLack of employment is a huge problem in the kingdom. How do you plan to help these teaming youths in order to prevent them from youth restiveness?\n\nBeing a young king, I have particular interest in the youth in my kingdom. They are our Nation builders, and will help build the Itsekiri Nation of the future. I have a few unconventional initiatives in the pipeline to address the issue of youth restiveness. Without giving away too much, I will say this; there is profit in every labour. Not everyone can get into the IOCs or banks or telecoms. With innovative thinking, we will create our own local economy without trying to over saturate what is already on ground. We will also set up schemes and structures to enable optimal output of large, medium and small scale industries already in operation.\n\nShare with us your immediate plans for the Itsekiri people?\n\nA reorientation of the mind. A wise man once said, to know where you are going, you must know where you are coming from. The warri crisis made many of our people to lose the essence of themselves. As the primary custodian of Itsekiri culture and an avid lover of history, I desire to bring a renaissance of our identity and purpose as a people. We will revisit foundations to enlighten and educate the people of our true identity. If we don\u2019t get those foundations correct, whatever you attempt to build will not be sustainable. We will get our foundations right.\n\nYou experienced one of the worst forms of discrimination by reason of the circumstances of your birth. Going forward, how would you ensure that no law or edict carries such descriminatory clauses?\n\nThe motto of our reign as revealed yesterday is Righteousness and Justice. We will use that foundation to view everything that concerns us as a people. And with God guiding us, we will effect the necessary change that ensures equity among our people.\n\nTo ensure a good relationship with all Itsekiris, in what ways would you like them to support you? What should they be doing and what should they not be doing?\n\nThey should know, that I am here to serve them. In everything I do, my intent is to always improve and add value to them, by making things better for them. Even, if it may not immediately appear palatable, because sometimes improvement can be uncomfortable or strange, they should trust that it\u2019s with good intention that I take an action or a decision. To conquer new frontiers we must be willing to embrace the foreign sense the unprecedented brings. I am also very open to feedback, and I welcome my people\u2019s input in my assignment to make things better for us as a people.\n\nWhat would you miss most now as the Olu?\n\nMy anonymity! People want to be celebrities so bad in this generation. I\u2019ve always appreciated my \u201canonymity\u201d. Now that it\u2019s been obviously taken away from me, I think that more than anything, this is what I will miss the most.\n\nI thank you for your time and wish you a peaceful reign.",

          "title": "Mercy Eke: Living Her Dream",
          "text": "Words by- Josephine Agbonkhese\n\nOur cover personality Mercy Eke needs almost no introduction. Since 2019 when she emerged winner of the Big Brother Naija, BBN, Season 4, Eke has grown in leaps and bounds, evolving from just a reality TV show contestant, to a video vixen, brands\u2019 ambassador, actress and successful real estates entrepreneur.\n\nThe Imo State University graduate is an embodiment of boldness, style and energy; three features that have continued to distinguish and endear her to many.\n\nIn this interview, she speaks of her newly-launched platform for giving back: The Mercy Eke Foundation, life as the only woman to have won the BBN grand prize so far; her love life and much more.\n\nHow has life been since 2019 when you won the Big Brother Naija Season 4?\n\nLife has really been good. Life has been amazing. I can\u2019t take anything for granted. God has been so wonderful to me and I\u2019ve really, really been working hard. So I would say life after Big Brother has been amazing.\n\nHas the win translated into gains as much as you expected?\n\nWell, I would say win plus hard work equals growth. I mean, there\u2019s been a lot of changes and a lot of growth. I\u2019m doing a lot of things. So, yes the win translated into growth.\n\nHow have you been handling the fame and celebrity status/lifestyle that comes with winning?\n\nWell, let me breath in first. It hasn\u2019t been easy. Ah! Celebrities! God! It\u2019s so hard to be a celebrity in Nigeria or in Africa. It\u2019s so hard like, it\u2019s so demanding but, you know, I just have to take it slowly and a step at a time. But we\u2019ll get there.\n\nGrowing up, did you dream of a life of fame?\n\nYes, I did. I had a lot of dreams and one of the major one was being famous. That was why I auditioned four times for BBNaija because I felt that my redemption might come from there; and it did!\n\nYou remain the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition. What do you think women in each editions haven\u2019t realised about winning?\n\nYes, I\u2019m the only woman to have won the grand prize in the competition for Big Brother Nigeria. Like I always tell people, it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s not a do or die affair and at the end of the day, there can only be one winner. I tried my best, and Africa and Nigeria were behind me; and they crowned me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how other women see it but for me, I am happy and I can\u2019t wait to welcome the next female winner because my back is already hurting me. I need someone else to join me on that seat.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to be the only female winner; so I pray a woman wins this year\u2019s Big Brother Naija.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion of the ongoing BBN Season 6?\n\nI think the season 6 housemates are unique in their own ways, but of course some people stand out more than others. So far, Maria, Whitemoney, Liquorose, Angel and Cross are giving me the vibes. As a BBN fanatic, if I have the power, these will be my top 5, and I will be so happy if any of them ace the game.\n\nDo you see yourself in any of the housemates?\n\nI see myself in Maria, Angel and Whitemoney; selfless, loving and outspoken.\n\nWho has the biggest chance of winning?\n\nThey all stand a chance of winning and may the best man win.\n\nTell us about your recently launched foundation?\n\nYes, I just recently launched my foundation; which has been, one of the things I wanted to do a long time ago. The Mercy Eke Foundation is about giving back to the society; giving back to the people that have nothing, giving back to the people who need it the most, and giving back to the people who made me what I am today. Helping small business owners, helping kids on the streets, single mothers, widows, students and more. So, yes, my foundation is just about giving back to the society.\n\nWhy did it take you this long to set it up?\n\nWell, it took me so long to start up my foundation because I wanted to get it right. I don\u2019t want to start a foundation because everyone has a foundation. I want to do it and I want to do it right, and also impact lives in the process. So, I had to take my time.\n\nHas it always been your dream to formally giveback to society or did this come as an afterthought?\n\nYes, it has been my dream to give back to the society. I\u2019m a giver. My heart is so big; I can\u2019t stand people suffering. I wish I could even do more. And it\u2019s been on my mind to help people; especially people that really need it. Our country is so bad right now that every day, I put this country in my prayers. I just want to see millions of struggling people in this country have at least, two square meals a day. So yes, I\u2019ve been giving, and giving back has always been my thing. I\u2019m glad I am able and I can do this at this point in my life.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen much of you in Nollywood as expected, aside Fate of Alakada, a few skits and in the forthcoming TV series \u2018TRIPS\u2019. What\u2019s happening?\n\nYes. You haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood as expected because coming out as a winner, I had a lot of things I had to do and I have been doing. Like now, I\u2019m currently shooting my reality show, setting up my business, foundation and working as an ambassador for brands I represent.\n\nBut right now, I\u2019m doing more of movies. I recently finished shooting a movie, Shanty Town, which is yet to be out. And I did another one Trips, which is a TV series. There\u2019s also another script I\u2019m currently on; so, I\u2019m ready for Nollywood. I think this is the time. And remember, whenever you wake up, it\u2019s your morning. So right now, Nollywood, here comes your girl!\n\nDoes this have anything to do with your venturing into the real estate sector last year with the establishment of Lambo Homes?\n\nYes. I wasn\u2019t accepting the scripts then because I wanted to set up my businesses and also push other things. So, yeah, I think those were the reasons you all haven\u2019t seen me so much in Nollywood.\n\nThe BBN Lockdown Season\u2019s reunion was staged recently; what do you think of the various housemates?\n\nI think all I see is growth and I love it. All of them are doing amazing. I\u2019m so proud of them.\n\nWho was your favourite and why?\n\nI think all of them. You know, they\u2019re all unique in their own ways.\n\nCan you recall your three best moments since 2019?\n\nI think the day I entered the BBN house, the day I came out of the house, and saw my parents from the stage and I was like \u201cMama, I made it\u201d, and also, the day I paid for my first home. These are my three best moments.\n\nYour fans were hopeful about your relationship with Ike Onyeka; what contributed to its crash?\n\nYou know, I was there and I have been there. Breakup happens and it is what it is. What crashed the relationship? I seriously don\u2019t know. I think we were not compatible; so it crashed.\n\nSo who\u2019s the man in your life right now and what do you love most about him?\n\nI can\u2019t mention his name. You know what they say about protecting people you love and cherish? That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I have a handsome, loving man by my side who supports and loves me. What I love about him is that, he is so consistent and intentional about me, and also, he\u2019s not about the social media life. He\u2019s a businessman and I love that he loves God. I just love him.\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest regret?\n\nI don\u2019t think I regret anything because everything that has happened to me is either a blessing or a lesson; so, I don\u2019t regret anything.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI have quite a number of people and women who inspire me across the globe. A lot of people inspire me, especially people I can relate with; people I see myself in. People that have been through a lot.\n\nFrom which of your parents did you draw your resilient, goal-getting spirit from?\n\nIt is from my mother; she is a hardworking woman and has been there for my siblings and I despite how we troubled her. My mother inspires me the most; she\u2019s my biggest supporter and she\u2019s my everything.\n\nYou did a butt job; what advice do you have for young women who also want to have cosmetic surgery?\n\nWell, do what makes you happy. Do what you want to do; it\u2019s your body, you call the shot and it is your money \u2014 spend it how you like to. Do whatever makes you happy.\n\nDescribe your style in two words?\n\nMy style in two words will be glam and fun.\n\nWhat do you look forward to? I look forward to greatness, opportunities, more growth, and everything good because I deserve everything good. I also look forward to good health, more business opportunities, open doors and all the good things of life.",

I thank you from the bottom of my heart. What you have done is an honour and honour will also find you.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing we can do to pay you back. Only God can repay you.\n\n\u201cBy God\u2019s grace, PDP is still the party to beat in Bayelsa State. Today is not for campaign, it is a day for unity.\n\n\u201cDo not divide the house because you are yet to get appointment. This is one family and we will increase in number.

          "text": "The Muhammadu Buhari administration has approved the setting up of integrated farm estates in all the senatorial districts across the country.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA), Prince Paul Ikonne, announced this at the weekend after a meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut to make the plan successful, Ikonne urged state governments to make arable lands available for the project.\n\nThe NALDA boss said the land provided for the project would enable the youth to leave the unemployment market and help the country to achieve food security within a short time.\n\nHe said the Kogi State government had donated 700 hectares of land to NALDA for the integrated land estate, while the 100 hectares of land donated by the Ogun State government had been cleared.\n\nIkonne said the President was committed to and working towards ensuring that the country achieved food security.\n\n\u201cWhat you see is that agriculture is one of Mr. President\u2019s heartbeat projects. He wants to see that we achieve food security in the country, and NALDA is purely under the supervision of Mr. President. That is why you can see the progress that we\u2019re making.\n\n\u201cI believe that the inauguration of the Daura Integrated Farm Estate in Katsina State, which has the capacity to take in 1,500 young farmers, is a stepping stone or an eye opener to Nigerians towards Mr. President\u2019s passion in achieving food security.\n\n\u201cNow, we didn\u2019t stop at the Daura project. As we speak, the Integrated Farm Estate in Borno State is 75 per cent completed. We are also doing, in 40 locations, fish villages to engage women to take in those people who are coming, the Internally Displaced people (IDPs), in order to get them reintegrated and get them engaged, thereby providing jobs for them.\n\n\u201cAs Mr. President is pursuing food security, he is at the same time creating job opportunities for Nigerians. That is what we are achieving or we are doing, using the NALDA platform,\u201d he said.\n\nIkonne said Nigerians would live to remember the foundation President Buhari is laying to make the country achieve food sufficiency.",

Gbasam and the Assistant Chief Registrar (Litigation), Patricia N. Victor Nwoka, restrained Secondus from parading himself as the PDP National Chairman.\n\nThe claimants/applicants in the suit No HC/240/2021, are: Ibeawuchi Ernest Alex, Dennis Nna Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen and Umezirike Onucha, while the defendants are: Secondus and the PDP.\n\nIn obedience to the Rivers State High Court order, Secondus abdicated his office and handed over to his deputy, Mr. Yemi Akinwonmi\n\nHowever, his supporters went to a Kebbi State High Court, which issued an interim order directing him to resume office, pending the determination of the substantive suit.\n\nBut few hours after respite came his way, another high court in Cross River State ordered him to stop parading himself as the Chairman of the main opposition party\n\nThe interim order was issued by Justice Edem Kufre, upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani, ahead of the PDP NEC meeting.\n\nTo ensure that he returns to his desk and also remains in office until the end of his tenure, Secondus has asked the appellate court to affirm that his four-year tenure will end on December 9, 2021.\n\nIn the appeal filed by his lawyer, Mr. Emeka Etiaba (SAN), the PDP chairman is challenging the order of the Degema High Court in Rivers State and the Calabar High Court in Cross River State.\n\nHe argued that Section 59(3) of the PDP constitution clearly stated that the wards or the state executive committee of any state has no powers to suspend any national officer of the party\n\nAccording to him, it is the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party that has the right to suspend a national officer after he has passed through a disciplinary committee.\n\nHe also insisted that the constitution of the party guaranteed that the tenure of any member of the NWC, including the national chairman, is four years, stressing that his tenure will end on December 9.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Balarabe Salame told THISDAY that the faction followed the party\u2019s guidelines by obtaining the forms and electing its executives at wards and local governments\u2019 levels.\n\nHe further disclosed that \u201cthe other faction just stayed in somebody\u2019s room and write the names of their executives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m telling you, what they did in the other faction is undemocratic; you can\u2019t deny people of their right to express their franchise,\u201d he added.\n\nSalame and the Speaker of the state house of assembly, Hon. Muhammad Aminu Achida, belongs to one faction, while the former governor of the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, and the Minister of Police Affairs, Mr. Maigari Dingyadi belong to another faction led by Wamakko.\n\nAddressing the delegates and members of the party in Bodinga, the headquarters of Bodinga Local Government Area of the state, the police minister said the party in the state in its wisdom adopted consensus.\n\nThe APC congresses were marred by the crisis in Adamawa State as aggrieved party members from Yola North and Yola South LGAs faulted the distribution of election materials to members who were not supposed to handle the materials.\n\nChairman of the Congress Committee, Professor Umar Katsayal, and his committee members narrowly escaped an attack by irate youths when they were about to leave the party\u2019s secretariat.\n\nThe youths stormed the party\u2019s secretariat in their numbers demanding election materials for their zones.\n\nThe senator representing Adamawa Central, Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed Binani also stormed the party secretariat to kick against the process.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that journalists (cameramen) were forced to delete the visuals of the fracas at the party secretariat.\n\nIn Mubi North and other local governments in the state, some APC stakeholders organised their own separate local government congress in their preferred venues.\n\nThe crisis in the Ogun State chapter of the party deepened yesterday as the group loyal to Governor Dapo Abiodun and a faction of the party led by Senator Ibikunle Amosun held parallel congresses across the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s congresses, the two factions of the APC had sworn in the elected executives that emerged from the parallel ward congresses they held in July.\n\nOn the eve of yesterday\u2019s congresses, the seven-man congress committee led by Mr. Wale Ohu had cautioned the APC members in the state against holding parallel congresses.\n\nAddressing journalists after the conduct of the congresses, Ohu emphasised that any congress held outside the supervision of the committee was null and void.\n\nWhile a faction of the party in Ekiti State called Southwest Agenda for Tinubu 2023 presidential poll (SWAGA) had challenged the previous ward congresses, the Ekiti State APC yesterday insisted that the local government congresses were undertaken without violating the constitution of the party and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe Secretary of the Ekiti State APC Congress Committee, Mr. Job Femi Akindeke, said the unconfirmed report that SWAGA went to court to challenge the ward congress did not vitiate the outcome of the local government congresses.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you that there wasn\u2019t any legal encumbrance to our local government congress. We followed the due process of the law,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to our people to exhaust internal mechanisms before resorting to court. The process is still ongoing and the party has not received any court order stopping us from doing what the party is constitutionally empowered to do,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Rivers State chapter of the APC led by the Minister of Transportation also yesterday held what it described as peaceful local government congresses across the 23 LGAs of the state.\n\nThe congresses were boycotted by the supporters of a former Senator representing Rivers East, Senator Magnus Abe.\n\nHowever, the spokesman of the caretaker committee of the party in the state, Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, told THISDAY that the election was peaceful and smooth, adding that the party was now positioned to take over power in the state.\n\nBut a leader of Abe\u2019s faction, who spoke off record, said they boycotted the exercise because it did not follow due process. The faction had rejected the ward congresses of APC held in the state.\n\nThe faction had also submitted a petition to the national secretariat of the party on the development.\n\nIn Niger State, the consensus option adopted by the APC to choose its local government officials hit the rocks in some parts of the state following the insistence by aspirants for election to be held.\n\nThe consensus arrangement was challenged in Chanchaga, Paikoro, Bida Lapai Agaie, among other LGAs.\n\nDespite the emergence of two factions of the party in Enugu State, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama has hailed what he described as the peaceful conduct of the local government congresses in the state.\n\nOnyeama disclosed this in the Udi Local Government Area of the state while briefing journalists on the outcome of the exercise in his council.\n\nThe minister described the process as democracy-in-action, adding that the people were allowed to willingly choose their leaders.\n\nHowever, supporters of the Director-General of the Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr. Osita Okechukwu, did not participate in the exercise held by Onyeama\u2019s faction.\n\nMeanwhile, former Senate President, Dr. Ken Nnamani, has described as fake, a letter purportedly issued by the national leadership of the party, recognising Mr. Ben Nwoye as the state party chairman.\n\nNnamani spoke during the congress in Nkanu West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nHe said that the letter which was circulating in the social media and purportedly issued by the Secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe was forged.\n\nIn Imo State, the congresses were conducted by supporters of Governor Hope Uzodimma without the participation of Senator Rochas Okorocha and Senator Ifeanyi Araraume\u2019s camps.\n\nImo State Chairman of the APC loyal to Governor Uzodimma, Chief Marcillinus Nlemigbo, said the exercise was free and fair.\n\nThe two APC factions in Lagos State also held parallel local government congresses across the 245 wards of the 20 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe two congresses were held without any violence as the factions comprising the Tunde Balogun-led group and the Lagos4Lagos group held their separate local government congresses in different venues.\n\nOn the side of the Balogun-led faction, a former member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Ahmed Ipoola Omisore said the Lagos chapter is returning the party to the people at the grassroots.\n\nIn Agege Local Government Area, the Vice-Chairman, Apex Committee, Lagos4Lagos, Hon. Prince Sunday Ajayi said his group remains the only faction of the Lagos APC that upholds the party\u2019s constitution in the conduct of the congresses.\n\n\u201cWe are two factions in Lagos but Lagos4Lagos is the only faction of the APC that conducted the ward congress. The other side only paraded appointed candidates but we own the population of the party.\n\n\u201cFor instance, they held local government election; Lagos APC registered 2.5 million members but less than 500,000 members voted as a result of our boycotting the election. We have over 2 million members in Lagos state and that is why the national body cannot close its eyes to us,\u201d he added.\n\nTwo factions of the party in Osun State led by Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, also battled each other in the state.\n\nThe exercise was marred by the crisis in Ede North LGA as armed political hoodlums reportedly attacked members of the party who were holding their congress in the area.\n\nThe thugs, according to eyewitnesses, stormed Film House, NITEL area, beside Pere Police Station, Ede, with guns, cutlasses, and other weapons with which they attacked members of the APC.\n\nA former Chairman of Ede North Local Council Development Area, Mukaila Uthman, confirmed the attack, saying that he was a witness.\n\nOfficers of the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Services (DSS), and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) witnessed the congress which was held at Oduduwa College Ile-Ife in Ife Central LGA.\n\nThe majority of the APC members that participated in the exercise were members of The Osun Progressives (TOP), loyal to Aregbesola\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, however, stated that the crisis rocking the state chapter of APC is an internal affair that will soon be settled amicably.\n\nIn Kwara State, the APC faction, which is loyal to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq adopted consensus for its local government congresses of the party.\n\nThe faction loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed was not part of the arrangement.\n\nIn Bayelsa State, a faction of the party held congresses despite a court order that restrained the party from holding congresses in the state.\n\nWhile the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, was reportedly absent due to official commitment out the country, the Vice Chairman, South-south Zone of the APC Caretaker/Extra ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Chief David Lyon, was seen at party secretariat in Yenagoa at the end of the exercise.\n\nHowever, Sunday Frank-Oputu, a chieftain of the APC and member of the faction led by Hon. Ebierien Fala, faulted the conduct of the congress, describing it as a violation of a subsisting court order before the State High Court and Court of Appeal, sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nFrank-Oputu called on the party leadership to sanction Sylva and the caretaker State Secretary of the party, Alabo Martins over conduct of the congresses against subsisting court order.\n\nIn Abia State, two factions loyal to the state Chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa, and Chief Ikechi Emenike, held parallel congresses but the Local Government Congress Committee led by Hon. Israel Goli only supervised the congress conducted by the faction loyal to Emenike.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Ask banks not to implement payment directives\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has cautioned the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the federal government against going ahead with the planned payment of the sum of $418 million to some individuals and organisations for the roles they played in the Paris Club refund received by the federal government.\n\nThe governors have also warned all chief executives/managing directors and chief compliance officers of Nigeria\u2019s commercial banks against implementing the directives to pay the said sum to the affected parties.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was said to have approved the payment of the controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors, without considering the governors\u2019 calls for a forensic audit into the claims of the creditors.\n\nFollowing Buhari\u2019s approval, the Federal Ministry of Finance was also said to have directed the Debt Management Office (DMO) to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors, as approved by the president.\n\nBut the NGF, in the warning letter to the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN); Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; and the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms. Patience Oniha, questioned the rationale behind the payment of the alleged debt to the said consultants and contractors.\n\nThe governors argued that the said payment is already an issue of litigation.\n\nThe governors in the \u201cCaveat\u201d letter dated Friday, September 3, 2021, also wondered why the federal government was in a rush to make such payment to individuals at a time when both the federal and state governments need funds for provisions of critical infrastructure for the people.\n\nThe letter signed on behalf of the NGF by its lawyer, Mr. PH Ogbole (SAN), also warned all chief executives/managing directors and chief compliance officers of Nigeria commercial banks against giving effect to any directive regarding the payment of the said sum to the affected parties.\n\nOgbole, in the letter titled, \u201cCaveat on the Payment of $418 million Suspicious Debts\u201d, argued that since the federal government was aware of the current court cases challenging the payment of the alleged debts, it ought not to take any further steps on the matter.\n\nAccording to the senior lawyer, the governors on August 3, 2021, got wind of the federal government\u2019s move to effect the payment.\n\nHe noted that the governors learnt that some consultants/contractors alleged that they were retained by some states and had done some work for the states and local governments in Nigeria about the Paris Club refund.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance is said to have directed the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO) to issue Promissory Notes in favour of the Consultants. The purported amounts claimed by the various consultants are as follows: Ned Nwoko \u2013 $142,028,941; Ted Iseghoghi Edwards -$159 million; Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello \u2013 $142,028,941.95 and Panic Alert System Limited and George Uboh \u2013 $47,831,920\u201d, Ogbole explained.\n\nHe explained that the consultants relied on judgments of the Federal High Court which are presently being challenged by the 36 governors in several actions in various courts.\n\nHe identified the cases to include suits number FHC/ Abj/CS/123/2018 between Panic Alert Security Systems Limited & Anor Vs Trustees of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum & 3 Others; FHC/ABJ/CS/453/2021 between\n\nTrustees of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum Vs Panic Alert Security Systems Limited & Anor (5 others); and M/3542/2021 between Riok Nigeria Limited Vs The Trustees of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum\n\nThe senior lawyer added that some of the consultants have already joined issues with the NGF, while the matters have been set down for hearing on September 28 and 29, 2021.\n\nHe further claimed that the Minister of Finance, the DG of DMO, and the AGF had since been duly served and notified of the pendency of these actions in court in different letters written by counsel to the NGF.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore strange and indeed alarming that having been served and made aware of the pendency of the various court cases, the Minister of Finance would readily but in complete disregard of the law direct that Promissory Notes be issued in favour of the consultants\u201d, he said.\n\nWhile arguing that custodians and managers of public funds are public trustees and must at all times act in the public interest, he stressed that the interest of all the states and local governments of the federation is involved in this instant case and ought to be protected by the Minister of Finance.\n\nOgbole added that \u201cthe issuance of Promissory Notes of a humongous sum of over $418 million to private persons for alleged consultancy work demands not only caution but strict due diligence, particularly when the judgments which gave rise to the payments sought to be enforced are the subject of pending litigation.\n\n\u201cMatters that are subjudice must not be acted upon in a manner that will foist a situation of complete helplessness on the courts and render their decisions nugatory,\u201d he added.\n\nHe, however, explained that this caveat was issued as a Further Notice to the Minister of Finance and the DG, DMO, to act in the interest of the public and refrain from foisting on the nation another case of P& lD in which, he noted, would have fleeced the nation of billions of dollars but for due diligence.\n\n\u201cThe nation is already going through economic adversity and every dollar is needed to be channelled to people-oriented projects. Public duty and probity demand that public trustees must, at all times, act in the interest of the people they serve to protect their commonwealth.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, justice must be allowed to run its full course.\n\n\u201cAll chief executives of banks and their compliance officers are hereby advised to desist from or otherwise not to accept for exchange or process for payment or giving value to any promissory notes issued by the DMO for purpose of satisfying alleged Paris Club Consultants fees afore-mentioned.\n\n\u201cThe entire public is also notified to be at the high alert of this hasty attempt to circumvent the rule of law and dissipate hard-earned public funds meant for development purposes to private persons on matters which are presently being litigated upon.\n\n\u201cLet no grant be sealed in the funds of the 36 states of the federation and the 774 local government areas in the sums mentioned in this caveat without notice to the caveator (the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum) as the matter of the payments is sub judice,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has ordered all telecom operators to shut down their networks in Zamfara State.\n\nUmar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission in a letter to all telecom operators on Friday said the action was one of the strategies taken by security operatives in curbing banditry ravaging the state.\n\n\u201cThe pervading security situation in Zamfara State has necessitated an immediate shutting down of all telecommunications service in the state from today September 03, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable relevant security agencies carry out required activities towards addressing the security challenge in the state, in line with the requirement, Globacom is hereby directed to shut down all sites in Zamfara State and any site(s) in neighboring state that could provide telecommunications service in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThe site shutdown is for two weeks (September 03 - 17, 2021) in the first instance. Your urgent action in this regard is required,\u201d a copy of the letter sent to Globacom Nigeria reads.\n\nHowever, checks by SaharaReporters showed that all the major networks were still working as at 11pm on Friday, except Airtel that was off in some areas.\n\nThere is suspicion among the residents that they may shut down anytime soon.\n\nThe Zamfara State Government had last Friday also announced some new measures aimed at tackling the growing activities of bandits in the state.\n\nThese included the restriction of fuel sales to the state capital and the headquarters of the local government areas and suspension of all weekly markets across the state.\n\nSimilarly, the government suspended the transportation of livestock to and from the state, saying the transportation of food across the state and outside Zamfara must be verified.\n\nIt stressed that the destination of the food must be authenticated otherwise, it would be seized and taken to the orphanage.\n\nThe new rules further include the banning of riding on motorcycles and tricycles from 6pm to 6am in the state, except the state capital which starts from 8pm to 6am every day.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, any tricycle that is covered will be stopped to verify its passengers, otherwise will be apprehended,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle reiterated the ban on more than two persons riding a motorcycle and warned that those who break the law stand the risk of being shot at by security operatives.\u201d\n\nThe government urged the people of the state to comply with the measures to avoid unfortunate incidents, saying security operatives would be empowered to treat offenders as suspected bandits.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has ordered all telecom operators to shut down their networks in Zamfara State.\n\nUmar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission in a letter to all telecom operators on Friday said the action was one of the strategies taken by security operatives in curbing banditry ravaging the state.\n\n\u201cThe pervading security situation in Zamfara State has necessitated an immediate shutting down of all telecommunications service in the state from today September 03, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable relevant security agencies carry out required activities towards addressing the security challenge in the state, in line with the requirement, Globacom is hereby directed to shut down all sites in Zamfara State and any site(s) in neighboring state that could provide telecommunications service in Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThe site shutdown is for two weeks (September 03 - 17, 2021) in the first instance. Your urgent action in this regard is required,\u201d a copy of the letter sent to Globacom Nigeria reads.\n\nHowever, checks by SaharaReporters showed that all the major networks were still working as at 11pm on Friday, except Airtel that was off in some areas.\n\nThere is suspicion among the residents that they may shut down anytime soon.\n\nThe Zamfara State Government had last Friday also announced some new measures aimed at tackling the growing activities of bandits in the state.\n\nThese included the restriction of fuel sales to the state capital and the headquarters of the local government areas and suspension of all weekly markets across the state.\n\nSimilarly, the government suspended the transportation of livestock to and from the state, saying the transportation of food across the state and outside Zamfara must be verified.\n\nIt stressed that the destination of the food must be authenticated otherwise, it would be seized and taken to the orphanage.\n\nThe new rules further include the banning of riding on motorcycles and tricycles from 6pm to 6am in the state, except the state capital which starts from 8pm to 6am every day.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, any tricycle that is covered will be stopped to verify its passengers, otherwise will be apprehended,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle reiterated the ban on more than two persons riding a motorcycle and warned that those who break the law stand the risk of being shot at by security operatives.\u201d\n\nThe government urged the people of the state to comply with the measures to avoid unfortunate incidents, saying security operatives would be empowered to treat offenders as suspected bandits.",

          "text": "Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has said Nigerians always find ways to make themselves happy despite living almost miserable lives.\n\nSowore stated this while responding to a question from Toyin Falola on the reconciliation between the security challenges bedevilling the country and the elaborate social events held in the country.\n\nFalola asked: \u201cHow do we reconcile banditry, killings with the elaborate social events in Nigeria, Obi Cubana, Buhari's son's wedding ceremony?\"\n\nSowore said the Nigerian state is already riddled with an internal crisis and Nigerians, young and old, simply find a way to keep their hopes alive.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Nigerian state is riddled with internal contradictions and these contradictions are multi-layered, some of them we can explain within sociology, some you can explain within the realm of religion, some you can explain within the realm of just keeping hope alive.\n\n\u201cYou see, young people embrace some of the most ridiculous means of interacting and engaging with themselves, while I get upset sometimes, I just understand that they have been beaten so badly every day, they never had a great life, they never had a government, no social security, they have to fend for themselves and it is just human to find a social outlet to make yourself happy when you are a Nigerian and you've had 60 years of unbroken record of abuse in the hands of leaders that have been on national stage.\n\n\u201cThat's what you see and call parties. The other layer of it is the complete political distraction too, socio-political distraction that I like to call it, they just allow some things to thrive so young people or old people will not have the presence of mind to pay attention to socio-political events that will destroy their lives.\n\n\u201cReligion, social activities, fun, betting, all these things are the reason why the Nigerian society is the way it is but there is also another layer to it, that Nigerians are unique in a special way, they have what has been described as the Cannabis gene, that is peculiar to Nigerians. We are like the happiest people on earth even though we live the most miserable life, nothing can explain why we are like that except that there is a gene somewhere sitting at the bottom of our abdomen that has made it easy for us to be happy or find a way to be happy even though we live in misery.\u201d",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Fintech Focus: The link between Open Banking and financial inclusion",
          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nRwanda\u2019s new SIM registration directives\n\nSomalia\u2019s Trade Information Portal\n\nCellulant\u2019s partnership with GAINDE 2000 to improve Africa\u2019s trade\n\nRwanda\u2019s new SIM registration directives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? Telecom operators will implement new SIM card registration procedures. The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA), Rwanda\u2019s telecom regulator, claims it will help reduce fraud.\n\nAccording to RURA, anyone who wants to get or swap a SIM card must do so at their telco\u2019s service centres, authorised agent shops, or kiosks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles Gahungu, General Manager, ICT Regulation Department, RURA, said the new procedure would improve SIM card security because it will include ID verification and photographing people buying or swapping SIM cards.\n\nWhat did the old procedure entail?\n\nSIM cards were only registered and activated after verifying that the National ID number presented by a potential buyer exists. Consequently, customer\u2019s SIM cards were registered using their IDs without their knowledge.\n\nWhat\u2019s changing? Before swapping or registering a SIM card under this new procedure, service providers must confirm that the National ID presented is the same as in the National Identification Agency\u2019s database. But that\u2019s not all. They now have to go a step further and match the face from the Agency\u2019s database to the person at their office, thus finally verifying ownership.\n\nBecause RURA can now track SIM card owners, this new procedure promises to help curb fraudulent acts like mobile money scams.\n\nAccording to George Kagabo, MTN\u2019s General Manager of Internal Audit and Forensics, the telecommunications company has registered seven cases of fraud this year stemming from unauthorised SIM swaps.\n\nSomalia launches Trade Information Portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Somalia has developed a Trade Information Portal with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to reduce costs and simplify trade procedures for Somali importers and exporters.\n\nWhat does this mean? Traders now have access to over 90 laws, regulations, procedures, and other trade-related measures from most of Somalia\u2019s government agencies. Also, African businesses can find out the applicable fees for obtaining licences and permits, all of which can be done on the website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy should you care? The portal is expected to significantly improve the country\u2019s business environment and attract foreign and domestic investors.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Trade Information Portal will help the Somali business community find needed information to facilitate their import-export activities. Also, traders will have easy access to information on Somalia\u2019s import and export regulations and procedures.\n\nExpectations? Cross-border trade between Somalia and its neighbour is expected to increase following the launch of the Trade Information Portal.\n\nCellulant partners with GAINDE 2000 to improve Africa\u2019s trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan payments company, Cellulant, has entered a five-year partnership with GAINDE 2000, a Senegal-based trade facilitation systems provider, to provide end-to-end infrastructure and payments solutions for governments and multinationals.\n\nHow will it happen? GAINDE 2000 will combine its e-government solutions with Cellulant\u2019s payment solutions to provide a comprehensive regional end-to-end technology and payments solution in Africa.\n\nWhat will the partnership offer? It will provide a digital payments platform to assist governments in improving their trade environment and meeting the challenges of payments and modern customs administration by reducing time and cost in trade transactions.\n\nWhy GAINDE 2000? The Senegalese company has a wide range of functionalities and allows traders and shipping companies to submit customs declarations online. Its primary business has evolved into the design, implementation, and operation of digital platforms for governments and businesses.\n\nTingg, a single digital payments platform provided by Cellulant, will address the complex payment needs of both governments and businesses.\n\nTingg makes it easy to collect and make payments using a variety of payment methods and currencies, connecting thousands of businesses with 154 payment options in 35 countries.\n\nDaniel SARR, Regional Executive Director of GAINDE 2000, says the partnership with Cellulant is not only a milestone in their journey to facilitate trade formalities, but it also represents a dramatic shift for the future of financial trade-related transactions, security operations, and human-driven applications.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nBuilding Shopify for Africa, Nigeria\u2019s Bumpa plans to digitise thousands of African businesses\n\nExperts explain how founders can strategically avoid the pitfalls of business partnerships\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nApple will ask before it targets you with its ads in iOS 15.

          "title": "Building Shopify for Africa: Nigeria\u2019s Bumpa plans to digitise thousands of African businesses",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian eCommerce startup, Bumpa, has raised a $200,000 pre-seed to digitise thousands of African businesses on its platform.\n\nGreencap Equity, HoaQ club, Rizq Investment Group, Microtraction, DFS Lab, Aidi Ventures, Prosper Otemuyiwa, Oo Nwoye, Perfect Makanju, Whogohost\u2019s venture arm, and a few other angel investors took part in the round.\n\nBumpa, formerly known as SalesCabal, was relaunched in February 2021 by Kelvin Umechukwu (CEO) and Adetunji Opayele (CTO). The company helps retailers manage and grow their businesses using their smartphones.\n\nFrom a side project to a full-time project\n\nUmechukwu and Opayele met in 2013 as students at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. They were part of the schools\u2019 tech community, building different products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter school, Opayele founded HostCabal, a company that helps small businesses host their businesses online. And in 2018, Umechukwu joined him as a business developer, albeit as a side gig.\n\n\u201cAfter we built it, we noticed that a lot of businesses were coming online. So rather than building websites for individual businesses, we decided to automate the process. That\u2019s how it began as a side project,\u201d Umechukwu explains to Techpoint Africa.\n\nBecause of the economic impact of COVID-19 in 2020, Opayele was confident that the product was ready for launch.\n\n\u201cBefore 2020, it was difficult to move businesses online. So the idea was to figure out how to get businesses online because they were completely offline and lacked the resources to digitise their operations. That was how we began building SalesCabal, not Bumpa,\u201d Umechukwu explains.\n\nIn May 2021, Umechukwu began working full-time at Bumpa with Opayele.\n\nBumpa helps merchants grow their businesses online\n\nThe startup, which Umechukwu calls \u201cShopify for Africa,\u201d assists merchants and businesses in moving their operations online. It allows merchants with no technical skills and experience to set up their eCommerce store using their smartphones.\n\nAdditionally, Bumpa merchants can use their smartphones to accept online and offline payments, manage inventory/products, handle bookkeeping, fulfil orders, track sales, request dispatch riders, easily engage customers, and much more.\n\nWhile Umechukwu attributes the successful round to having the right team and supportive investors who recognise value, he believes that with the financing, many small businesses will thrive as they leverage technology for business growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrowth and expansion\n\nThe startup claims to have onboarded over 7,000 merchants on its platform in the past six months, with a 50% month-on-month (MoM) growth rate. Bumpa also says that merchants have listed more than 30,000 products and completed over $500,000 in recorded transactions.\n\nThe startup is looking to provide more small business owners with tools to help them grow their businesses and hopes to reach 200,000 merchants by 2022.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand its operations and onboard more merchants on its platform.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are not looking at driving into other countries operationally until 2022. We still have a lot to capture here in Nigeria,\u201d Umechukwu says.\n\nBumpa will also expand its team and introduce new features to improve merchant support as it seeks to help its customers increase their sales by at least 20% MoM.\n\n\u201cBumpa was built primarily for emerging markets.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe past few years have been interesting for SMEs in major African countries. E-commerce companies have popped up, making previously challenging service delivery easy to accomplish, even without physical meetings.\n\nPrudence*, a civil servant who runs a business on the side selling soft drinks in bulk, used to deliver packages to customers with her car. However, this delivery model was unsustainable and she needed an extra hand.\n\nFollowing a recommendation, she got a tricycle rider to handle dispatches to customers at rates less than what logistics companies would typically charge. But not long after, he went off the radar with goods for delivery. Prudence counted her losses and went in search of another dispatch rider.\n\nPrudence\u2019s story \u2014 a true one, I should add \u2014 is only a simple example of what can go wrong in a business partnership. A study shows that 70% of business partnerships fail and 90% of startups ultimately fail in the first 10 years mainly because of bad partnerships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite their role in startup failure, partnerships are crucial to the running of a business \u2014 all the more so when the business is a startup \u2014 because these relationships help companies have a robust offering and improve their service delivery.\n\nAfrican tech angel investor, Zachariah George, believes that \u201cit is actually hard for startups in Africa to scale without entering partnerships, especially with corporates.\u201d\n\nA major telemedicine startup, for instance, would have to partner with a network of doctors and pharmacies whose poor performances could negatively impact the startup.\n\nIs partnership a necessary evil?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge is the Managing Partner at early-stage venture capital firm, Launch Africa Ventures, and the Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of StartupBootcamp Africa \u2014 an accelerator. His viewpoint about creating value for portfolio startups is that connecting startups with relevant industry players is more important than raising funds for them.\n\nExplaining the important role that partnerships play in a startup\u2019s growth to Techpoint Africa, he makes it clear that entering a business relationship is more important than raising funds, and partnership decisions should be made early in a startup\u2019s lifecycle.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that anyone can raise money, and raising money doesn\u2019t make you more valuable. You need to be able to execute on your business irrespective of whether you\u2019re a B2B or B2C. Ultimately, you need to be able to generate revenue.\u201d\n\nSince raising money is easy, startups can only position themselves as valuable without the funds by showing potential for commercial traction. A startup with strategic agreements in place to address customer acquisition, for instance, has more potential when promising recurring revenue to an investor.\n\n\u201cAs a world-class accelerator, our first point of call is how we can help startups to begin generating revenue. We need to ensure that they can sign contracts, do proof of concepts, carry out pilots, commercial agreements and licence deals with insurance companies, telcos, retailer banks, and manufacturing firms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you can create value. And if you can justify that contract is in place, then you can go to investors to say \u2018I have a proof of concept with this insurer or bank, now I can raise money and I know the cost of delivering on this contract.'\u201d\n\nIn other words, partnerships are meant to add value.\n\nNigerian healthtech startup, WellaHealth, has a network of over 1,400 pharmacies. And according to Olanrewaju Akintobi, WellaHealth\u2019s Business Development Manager, \u201cpartnership is a key means to grow and also extend value to the last mile. We have seen tremendous value dissemination in terms of symbiotic partnership across board.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nIn considering a partnership, Omoniyi Kolade, Founder of pan-African payments startup, SeerBit, says the brand has to go through a rigorous partner selection process.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to find agreement terms that are favourable and within the business\u2019s capacity to commit/deliver, to ensure customer satisfaction, and also avoid reputational damage in the market.\u201d\n\nAvoiding subtle traps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying safe in startup-partnership waters means answering some questions.\n\nHow does one make the best choice when considering a partnership? Which partnerships are likely to be productive?\n\nWhatever answers they provide, Kolade and Akintobi agree that partnerships must be based on aligned values.\n\nA good example is a business owner whose elaborate long-term plans are far removed from a prospective partner\u2019s short-term financial goals.\n\nAccording to Kolade, SeerBit has gotten it right since launching in 2019, with no tales of woe because the business looks out for \u201creputable partners that are strategically aligned with our vision, strategic needs, and interests.\u201d\n\nThis means partners must be interested in SeerBit\u2019s mission to solve the problem of fragmented payment in Africa.\n\nHe adds that a partner must be armed with the infrastructural capability and experience to meet the terms of the agreement.\n\nAkintobi holds similar views and says, \u201cOur partners are registered businesses, our pharmacy partners are registered with PCN. While our distribution partners are registered companies who share our beliefs and values.\u201d\n\nApart from mutual interest and credibility, other partnership issues include financial agreement and quality of service.\n\nSuccessful partnerships are the result of all parties pulling their weight, and if one party makes a greater financial commitment than the other, the relationship might be heading for the rocks. Unless, of course, that is one of the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nCases where one partner wants to be paid back for unquantifiable efforts \u2014 like sweat equity \u2014 present problems, especially in short-term agreements, since there will be no compensation if there are no profits. This does not always have to be an issue if the contract clearly articulates how to measure the sweat equity.\n\nSome contracts have an exclusivity clause restricting startups from entering other partnerships for the duration of the contract. George\u2019s take on this is that staying away from partnerships requiring exclusivity is a healthy move for startups. But he advises that where necessary, it should range between six and twelve months.\n\nAs Kolade points out, when potential partners tick all the right boxes, presenting vague agreement terms is still a huge red flag. If the agreement is not flexible and transparent \u2014 profit sharing formula also \u2014 it is a shady deal.\n\nIn the search of partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge\u2019s years of experience connecting startups to the right partners in startup-corporate partnerships have helped him develop an approach that works.\n\n\u201cIt is more like reverse engineering. Instead of startups pitching to the corporate sector, we look for problems that startups can help them solve. We consider what the corporate sector struggles with and then we find a way for a startup to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nPaying attention to the mutual benefits is key, but Kolade posits that \u201cpartnerships can also be experiments in which you learn and tweak partnership strategies. There are no hard and fast rules on what kind of partnerships businesses like ours can pursue.\u201d\n\nFor context, as a payments processing platform \u2014 with typical partners like banks, payment switches, and card schemes such as Visa and Mastercard \u2014 SeerBit looks to partner with non-financial businesses serving the same market.\n\nWellaHealth on the other hand, as a healthtech startup, can find partnerships with a mobility company or a payments company, or vice versa. Ultimately, as Akintobi states, partners must be \u201ckeen on improving healthcare outcomes in Africa and drive products to the last mile while giving value to their offerings.\u201d\n\nTo avoid sad partnership stories, parties must enter into their relationships with a great degree of trust for each other, which can only result from honesty on both sides. While businesses may never be able to predict how partners will eventually conduct themselves, bad outcomes can be mitigated with the \u2018due diligence\u2019 this piece clearly outlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWARRI \u2013 The Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi has visited Olu Of Warri, His Majesty, Ogiame Atuwatse III, in his place in Warri, Warri South Council Area of Delta State.\n\nDr. Fayemi expressed delight during the visit, saying the Olu has Indeed made Nigeria\u2019s hope to come alive with his speech during the Coronation which held amidst pomp on August ,21st. The governor said the speech has made Nigeria and particularly, the Warri kingdom, the toast of the global community.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure and delight to be here before you. On behalf of the Nigerian Governors, the 35 of us , apart from myself here, you have received quite a number of them since two weeks.\n\n\u201cNotably the governor of Kebbi, Delta State Governor has been here for the thanks giving; as governors representing the entire federation, we want to formally present ourselves here to congratulate you and the entire Warri kingdom for God\u2019s presence in this kingdom.\n\n\u201cAll over the world we have been enthused, honoured as a people. You re-invented Nigeria in the eyes of the world .\n\n\u201cFor those of us who are Omoluabi from the roots we thank God for your coronation. It was most organised .\n\n\u201cWe know that it is a sign of what is ahead of us, a sign of the possibilities in our nation. It is a sign that whatever the challenges is, that we may be going through,: the valleys, hills, the meandering lines, what is clear is that this nation is on the path to positive development.\n\n\u201cYour ascension to the throne is not just an indication of positive development to happen in the kingdom, it is a positive signal that the best is yet to come in our country. And that in your reign all our losses, pride of place as a country will be restored .\n\n\u201cThe peace, the prosperity, development we are all yearning for as a people will come upon us .\n\n\u201cThe insecurity in the land will become a thing of the past. We know that this is history in the making. You are not just destined to play this critical role, it is God ordained.\n\n\u201cAnd on behalf of all my colleagues that have sent me here even after I spoke on the phone with Your Majesty, I want to reassure you that we will cooperate with this kingdom in whatever way you want us to work with your stool, right from our colleague in Delta state. Just call on us, we will support you and do whatever is necessary for this country to progress and this kingdom is respected among the committees of kingdoms in the country.\n\n\u201cIn Ekiti, royalty is very important. As Yoruba people with very strong links to the Itsekiri we see this as our own celebrations. And I pray that this time will be good times, God has earmarked this kingdom for great good that will spread across the country. And your time shall be remembered for the positive in many ways.\n\nResponding, His Majesty, Ogiame, Atuwatse III, expressed appreciation to the governor for his goodwill and pray for peace in Iwere land and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cWhen we wrote our speech for coronation we focused on Itsekiri. I say that this thing God has done, I humbly submit myself in service to the Federal republic of Nigeria and the government.\n\n\u201cWe said we were going to redefine the roles of the Olu of Warri. Were we can put our heads together with government , the legislators to come up with creative ways to build our people from the grassroots, our women, we want to help the people. We want to create services that will improve not just Warri kingdom but the country\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, His Majesty Ogiame Atuwatse III, on Saturday formally confirmed seven additional traditional chiefs in Itsekiriland in continuation of the revalidation exercise.\n\nThe exercise followed an earlier public notice by the monarch dissolving the Council and other committees in the Kingdom.\n\nThe event took place at Ode-Itsekiri, the ancestral home of the Itsekiri people.\n\nThose who had their chieftaincies revalidated at the ceremony on Saturday included Chief Isaac Jemide (Oshodin); Chief Sunday Rone (Obazuaye); Chief (Sir) P.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Securities and Exchange Commission has unveiled plans to reduce its operating costs in order to boost profitability within the next two years.\n\nThe Director-General, SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda who said this in Abuja, also said that the Commission has been paying 25 per cent of gross revenues to the coffers of government.\n\nSpecifically, he said that the total revenue so far paid by SEC into the treasury as of the end of June, 2021 was about N1.5bn.\n\nWhile admitting that the Commission has been operating under very difficult circumstances since it is currently superintending over a market that was affected by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, assured that steps are being taken to reverse the fortunes of the apex regulator of the capital market.\n\nHe said that, \u201cIf we go through the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework which we started last year, a look at the 2022 and 2023, you will see that we have worked on our expenditure so that by 2023, the deficit will actually turn into a surplus of N1.235bn and by 2024 we should have N2.5bn surplus.\n\n\u201cWe therefore need the support of all to engineer the kind of transition we are thinking of at the SEC and that 30 per cent which is taking most of the staff cost is part of the set we are targeting for the early retirement programme.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest within the Commission to do it but we are really short of the funds to do it now. We have done a lot of revenue rising drives just to ensure that the Commission stays on track.\n\n\u201cThis is something we are mindful of and we have the intent and capacity to deliver on this.\n\nOn the high overhead costs, the SEC DG explained that this is being reduced aggressively.\n\nYuguda said. \u201cIt has reduced because we have since we came, aggressively looked at the overhead and staff cost and reduced certain components of our staff pay that has generated over N2bn of savings as at now.\n\n\u201cIf you take the MTEF numbers, as you go forward, you find that by 2024 staff cost reduces to only N5.88bn. So that is the trajectory that we are working on.\u201d\n\nTo shore up the resources of SEC, he said the Commission has approached a number of institutions like the African Development Bank, Financial Sector Development Africa and a number of other donors.\n\nThis, he said, is expected to fetch a grant figure of N3.84bn, adding that more grant is being expected in the near term to boost operations.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that not only for the sake of cutting down on the cost of the SEC, when we came last year, we discovered there has been no IT investment in the SEC for over a decade.\n\n\u201cSo, our IT infrastructure is now obsolete so we have to renew that. And given this difficulty, we could only do that by going out and looking for grant and thankfully we have gotten very positive feedback. But this grant is only going to address investment in IT infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to ensure we deliver, from 2023 the tide will begin to change and that is because of the massive efforts that we have made both on the revenue front and on the cost front.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "AMCON: Experts call for National Policy On Debt Recovery",
          "text": "The Nigerian government has been challenged to expand the laws that granted the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) special debt recovery powers in the AMCON Act into a national law.\n\nA statement by AMCON on Sunday said that Oluwakemi Balogun, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), made the call at the weekend while speaking at a training programme organised for solicitors, receivers and managers at Eko Hotel in Lagos.\n\nMr Balogun, according to the statement, argued that the move would insulate the banking sector against reckless borrowers and recalcitrant debtors that AMCON is currently chasing for the recovery of trillions of Naira.\n\nThe statement said that the Nigerian government debt recovery agency, which has since inception in 2010 recovered over N1.4trillion, had at different phases from the year of its establishment purchased 12,743 Non-Performing Loans or Eligible Bank Assets (EBAs) worth N3.8 trillion from 22 Eligible Financial Institutions (EFIs) for a purchase price of N1.8 trillion.\n\nSince then, AMCON said it has worked tirelessly to recover the huge debt, which were covered by various collaterals.\n\n\u201cBut as the years roll by, AMCON obligors have become more daring, and hiding under all manners of legal technicalities to delay the agency from recovery,\u201d the agency said.\n\nMr Balogun said debt recovery in Nigeria will continue to burden AMCON as well as the financial sector as long as the system allows some Nigerians to brazenly walk into banks to borrow money with no intention to repay the loan obligation.\n\nHaving watched such financial rascality for some decade, the legal expert opined that something drastic must be done by the government to save the country.\n\nAccording to him, some Nigerians in the last 25 years have perfected the act of going to different banks to borrow money and have serially defaulted in the repayment agreement because the country has no policy that guides such recklessness.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a national law that will assistant lenders (banks and financial institutions),\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cWe must have a national policy. There must be a national law on debt recovery. This law should not just be for only AMCON as a government agency but for the nation as a whole. That is one of the ways we can curb the bad behaviour.\n\n\u201cIn some other economies you cannot borrow money and refuse to pay back and go scot-free. Therefore, Nigeria should not allow recalcitrant debtors to go unpunished.\u201d\n\nThe statement said that Mr Balogun was reacting to the different presentations at the programme including the keynote address of the AMCON Managing Director/CEO who was represented at the event by Benedict Daminabo, a Group Head of Asset Management.\n\nThe AMCON CEO had earlier said the agency will continue to highlight the dangers of not recovering outstanding debt because of its grave implication.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have repeatedly made the point at every opportunity that all stakeholders must view the AMCON mandate as one of serious national importance. If at sunset AMCON is unable to recover the huge debt of over N5trillion, it becomes the debt of the Federal Government of Nigeria for which taxpayers\u2019 monies will be used to settle.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that the public will be made to pay for the recklessness of only a few individuals who continue to take advantage of the loopholes in our laws to escape their moral and legal obligations to repay their debts. As a matter of fact, we have reached a point in our country where all stakeholders (the federal government, the judiciary, the legislature and the public) must work together to fight the common enemy of this huge debt burden.\u201d\n\nThe statement said that despite the challenges, AMCON is steadily making remarkable recoveries but still has about 7,902 outstanding obligors with total outstanding loan of N3.142 trillion.\n\n\u201cOf this number, 350 of the agency\u2019s obligors account for N2.053 trillion, which is above 65% of total outstanding amount,\u201d the statement said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

Its competitors however kissed the canvas, according to the same report.\n\nWhile Globacom got an additional 1,007,259 new subscribers to move from 50,130,540 in June to 51,137,799 at the end of July, MTN, Airtel and 9mobile suffered losses in their subscriber base.

          "title": "Section 59 (3) of PDP Constitution: The need for NEC to correct Secondus\u2019 misuse of power, By Abayomi Ojosegun",
          "text": "It is no longer news to all Nigerians that the immediate past National Chairman of the country\u2019s main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, Prince Uche Secondus got to power and eventually got drunk with the supply of authority that the office of National Chairman accorded him as the occupier of that exalted position.\n\nUche Secondus, a man who climbed the ladder from the lowest ladder through the local government, up to the state and finally to the National level cannot be called a novice in the business of politicking but on getting to the topmost level of his political attainment, Secondus forgot how he rose to that all-in-all position of authority, he knew what was right but decided to go through the wrong path by systematically deploying all authorities in his care to destroy the reputation of an already battered image of the opposition party with avarice and unprecedented lust for money.\n\nIn a recent interview with the media, Uche Secondus was quoted to have said that \u201cNOBODY OR ANY ORGAN OF THE PARTY CAN REMOVE ME OR ANY MEMBER OF NEC EXCEPT THE NEC.\u201d Isn\u2019t that awesome?\n\nThe above quotation drew the attention of political watchers who have watched with reckless abandon, how Uche Secondus, in the last 18 months had taken critically wrong steps to denigrate on the constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party which he signed into law in December, 2017 when he was elected as the National Chairman of PDP alongside other members of the National Working Committee of the party.\n\nAll along the section 59(3) of PDP was not altered and it was interesting now that Uche Secondus was given a dose of his own pill with which he has fed many state Chairmen of the party who are also NEC members, he suddenly remembered that \u201cNOBODY EXCEPT THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, NEC of the party has power to remove him or any member of NEC.\n\nWith particular reference to Osun State where I come from, Prince Uche Secondus breached the provisions of the PDP constitution in section 59 (3) by acting ultra vire on a frivolous, baseless and unsubstantiated allegations of Malfeasance, Maladministration and anti-party activities leveled against a sitting Chairman via a petition initiated by a gang of faceless defectors into the party, that petition lacked merit in all ramifications and through it Secondus removed the validly elected State Chairman of the party, Hon. Olasoji Adagunodo, a member of NEC like Uche Secondus, with official fiat without recourse to the same NEC that has that power to which he has suddenly turned to for adjudication. It will be unfair to the rule of law if Secondus is not made to pay for his sins.\n\nUche Secondus promised to use all diligent due processes to investigate the allegations of malfeasance, maladministration and anti-party activities by total strangers who are non-financial members of the party, two of newly whom decamped from SDP and APC into at that time and were used as tools to destabilize the party.\n\nSecondus refused to investigate the matter and neither did he forward his findings through the National Disciplinary Committee which was supposed to send its findings to the National Executive Committee and recommend appropriate measures to the NEC.\n\nInstead three man fact finding team was secretly sent to Osun through the then National Vice Chairman and Secretary of the party in the South West, Dr. Eddy Olafeso and Revd. Bunmi Jenyo respectively which they deliberately shielded from Adagunodo but their plans got leaked and Adagunodo was there to defend himself and the fact finding committee was left with no choice than to report back to Secondus that all allegations against the trio of Hon. Olasoji Adagunodo, the State Chairman, Prince Bola Ajao, the State Secretary and Hon. Adesoye Oyetunde, the State Treasurer be dropped for want of evidence.\n\nRather than accepting the recommendations of the fact finding committee, Uche Secondus inadvertently exonerated the last two and held on to Adagunodo as if he ever did anything wrong.\n\nSecondus turned himself to the 7 man investigative panel as well as National Disciplinary Committee and the NEC by taking all decisions and issued all directives by ordering Adagunodo to step aside for more than 5 months instead of \u201cnot more than 30 days\u201d as stipulated by the constitution which Secondus signed into law, he issued that directive in a letter dated 30th April, 2020.\n\nHe thereafter ordered the Deputy State Chairman of the party to take over in acting capacity and 6 months later, 30th of October, he issued another letter claiming to have \u201cvalidated all malevolent allegations against Adagunodo without investigation, without any National Disciplinary Committee sitting or inviting the accused Chairman.\n\nAdagunodo, took his time thereafter as he complied with the directives from April, 30, 2020 when Uche Secondus told him to step aside in a letter that was purportedly signed by the National Secretary of the party but whose signature was allegedly suspected to have been forged by Uche Secondus cronies which I personally believe was forged.\n\nI challenged the National Secretary to hold the Holy Quran to swear publicly in front of NEC members if truly he was the one that signed that letter of stepping aside that was issued to Hon. Olasoji Adagunodo during the COVID-19 lockdown, I know Alhaji Ibrahim Tsauri to be a devout and truthful practising Muslim who fears God who will not swear falsely, I will implore the NEC to call him and verify this allegation of forgery against Uche Secondus who was making millions of Naira from the Osun highest bidder that wanted to buy the party structure.\n\nShortly before the Governorship election of Ondo State, Uche Secondus asked for his sponsor in Osun for financial assistance to prosecute the Ondo State Election and he was given the condition to get money only if he removed Adagunodo as Osun state chairman which led to the fathom validation of malevolent allegations that ended up in the unauthorised removal and wrongful replacement of a NEC member by Uche Secondus without recourse to NEC on Adagunodo\u2019s illegal removal and his unauthorised replacement with Sunday Bisi.\n\nMy appeal to the National Executive Committee of PDP is to really come out openly, investigate the Osun matter and how Uche Secondus polarized the party with his greed for money, find out the truth and without wasting time, return Hon. Olasoji Adagunodo back to office which is the only solution to the lingering crisis of the party in that state.\n\nThe inability of the Senator Bukola Saraki Led National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee to resolve the Osun crisis has been largely suspected because of Dr. Deji Adeleke who is the chief sponsor of the crisis rocking Osun State and Senator Bukola Saraki that all of us in Osun State believe is a man of conscience also needs to work very hard, with all seriousness it requires to wash himself clean of this allegation of nepotism and his alleged failure to be truthful where personal friends are involved.\n\nThe PDP NEC members must also bear it in mind that failure to tackle the crisis head long, expose the ills of Uche Secondus against the mandate freely given to Adagunodo by the people of the state will make the party to be ridiculed everywhere during all forthcoming\n\nelections, not only in Osun but beginning from Ekiti and in other National elections because PDP has a new outlook and is being nicknamed A PARTY OF LAW BREAKERS\u201d throughout the South West.\n\nAnything short of resolving the Osun crisis which Uche Secondus created by violations of section 59 (3) of PDP constitution through the reinstatement of the validly elected chairman of the party and reversing the imposition of the party Publicity Secretary as the Chairman of the party to his elected office as the image maker of the party will continue to rock polarise PDP in Osun State and beyond.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun State deputy governor, Mr Benedict Alabi, members of the National Committee on Local Government Congress, among others, have expressed satisfaction with the peaceful conduct of Saturday\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) Local Government Congress in the state, noting that there was no parallel congress anywhere.\n\nThe exercise, which was supervised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), was adjudged to be peaceful by critical political stakeholders across the state.\n\nAlabi, while participating in the exercise at St John\u2019s Primary School, Ayedaade Ikire, in Irewole Local Government Area of Osun State, expressed delight with the massive turnout of members of the party.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, alongside the former speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, Chief Mrs Patricia Etteh and the State Commissioner for Finance Hon Bola Oyebamiji, also commended the INEC officials and committee members who supervised the exercise for their display of democratic principles of fairness and equity.\n\nWhile congratulating the 27-man exco elected at the congress to supervise the affairs of the party in the local government, Alabi tasked them to see their election as a call to service by uniting all interests within the party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is a very peaceful and calm atmosphere; I am really impressed by the conduct, it is a pointer to the fact that our party, the APC is peaceful and well organized, let us continue to work for the unity of our party and to ensure our party come victorious in the coming governorship election in our state\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, the commissioner for Finance in the state, Mr. Bola Oyebamiji applauded the people of the local government for their peaceful conduct during the congress, saying that APC is known for peace and the people of the council area have proven that.\n\nOyebamiji also expressed satisfaction on the conduct of the national delegation under the chairmanship of Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye for a job well done.\n\nHe said what should be paramount in the heart of every member of the party now is how to re-elect governor Adegboyega Oyetola for the good work to continue.\n\nOyebamiji urged the newly sworn in local government executives to work round the clock in ensuring unity within the party, saying that unity will remain the only bedrock for the success of the party in 2022 election.\n\nHe, however, implored all the aggrieved members of the party to embrace peace and work hamoniously with the newly sworn in executives for the betterment of all.\n\nIn his remarks after the conclusion of the exercise, Hon Arimiyau Owoade, who returned as party chairman in the local government, thanked the leaders and members of the party on behalf of other members of Exco, for the confidence reposed in them.\n\nCommittee Express Satisfaction\n\nSimilarly, members of the National Committee on Local Government Congress of the party expressed satisfaction over the peaceful conduct of the party\u2019s members in the State.\n\nThe Committee affirmed that there was no parallel congress anywhere in the State except on Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nIt also expressed delight wuth the way and manner the party\u2019s supporters and loyalists trooped out en masse to exercise their right of electing new officers of the party across the Local Governments of the State.\n\nRecall that the national leadership of the ruling party under the leadership of Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee had earlier resolved and directed the conduct of the Local Government Congresses across the 774 Councils in the country.\n\nThe members of the party\u2019s national delegation for the Local Government Congress to Osun had on Friday, held a stakeholders\u2019 meeting at the party\u2019s secretariat, where they charged members to exhibit the Omoluabi ethos for which Osun is known for and promised to conduct a hitch-free and credible exercise.\n\nBy Saturday morning, they visited some of the Councils where they monitored, supervised and observed the conduct of the Congress.\n\nAmong the Councils visited as at the time of filing the report were Osogbo Local Government, Boripe Local Government and Boluwaduro Local Government.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the members of the Committee, the Committee\u2019s Chairman, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, lauded the peaceful conduct of the party loyalists, describing it as commendable and worthwhile.\n\nElegbeleye who commended the consensus model adopted by the leadership of the party, said there was no parallel congress anywhere as against the insinuations making the rounds.\n\nAccording to him, nothing like parallel congress was either seen or observed by the Committee in any of the visited places or being reported by the Committee members observing and supervising the election process in any of the Councils in the State.\n\n\u201cWe have been to several places. We have been to Osogbo, Boripe, Boluwaduro among others, and we met very large crowd where consensus was adopted as model to which the new officers were elected by the party\u2019s members,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThings were very perfect; the atmosphere was peaceful and we were very impressed by the way and manner which the people conducted and comported themselves peacefully without any rancour whatsoever.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, consensus is what the party has always subscribed to and this is what was largely adopted in the State, and with what we have seen so far, there is nothing like parallel anywhere except on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe are very glad to witness this Congress in a peaceful atmosphere as this is in line with the principles of our party.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks during the visit of the members of the Committee to his Council in Iragbiji, Boripe Local Government, Governor Oyetola applauded the members of the party across the State for allowing peace to reign.\n\nHe attributed the atmosphere of peace to the existing show of love and the spirit of togetherness reigning in the party, saying it was a reflection of the fact that the party members were united and formidable.\n\n\u201cI thank the members of the party for the sense of duty, love and peace that have been observed so far. This is to show that our party is united absolutely.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the members of the Committee for being very fair and efficient in discharging their responsibility. We are very proud of you. I congratulate the newly elected executives. This is a call to service.\n\n\u201cYou must serve with the fear of God. As you all know, the party\u2019s members have reposed confidence in you and you must justify this and you must not disappoint them,\u201d Oyetola added.",

This is one of them,\u201d Olulade said.\n\nHe said the APC had been jittery with the decision of the PDP to zone its presidential ticket to the North.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOlulade further alleged that those next in line to be arrested are Lamido, Aliyu and former Kano State governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso among several others whom he claimed had been penciled down from the northern part of the country.\n\nAlso corroborating Olulade, another member of the opposition PDP, who is on the party\u2019s NEC said, \u201cWe have it on good authority that the EFCC will cave in any time soon and we are alerting the country to these devious schemes of the ruling party.\u201d\n\nWhile describing the move as counterproductive, the PDP NEC member said Saraki, Kwankwaso and others were initially cleared by the EFCC for the same petitions that the anti-graft agency wants to use as basis for their planned arrest.",

          "text": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticized Guinea\u2019s alleged coup on Sunday and asked the country\u2019s detained president to be released by putschists who claimed power.\n\n\u201cI am personally following the situation in Guinea very closely. I strongly condemn any takeover of the government by force of the gun and call for the immediate release of President Alpha Conde,\u201d Guterres tweeted.\n\nSoldiers who staged an uprising in Guinea\u2019s capital on Sunday claimed on state television that they had disbanded the country\u2019s government and constitution, as well as shut down all land and air borders.\n\nAn attack on the presidential palace in Conakry, however, was resisted, according to the defense ministry.\n\nOn Sunday morning, fighting erupted outside the palace, with various sources claiming that the violence was caused by an elite national army unit led by Mamady Doumbouya, a former French legionnaire.\n\nPresident Alpha Conde was seen in a room surrounded by army special troops in videos uploaded on social media on Sunday afternoon, which Reuters could not immediately verify.\n\nConde, whose whereabouts are unknown, won a third term in October after altering the constitution to allow him to run again, despite violent opposition protests, prompting fears of more political upheavals in a region that has already experienced coups in Mali and Chad.\n\nDoumbouya appeared on state television wrapped in Guinea\u2019s national flag and flanked by eight other armed troops, announcing that his allies planned to create a transitional administration and promising to provide more details later.\n\n\u201cWe have dissolved government and institutions,\u201d Doumbouya said.\n\n\u201cWe call our brothers in arms to join the people,\u201d he added.\n\nAs the defence ministry said security forces loyal to Conde had repulsed the attack and were restoring order, people emerged onto the streets during the afternoon to celebrate the uprising\u2019s apparent success.\n\nA Reuters witness saw pick-up trucks and military vehicles accompanied by motorcyclists and cheering onlookers. \u201cGuinea is free! Bravo,\u201d a woman shouted from her balcony.\n\nTo replenish state coffers, the Guinean administration has dramatically increased and doubled levies in recent weeks.\n\nFuel prices have risen by 20%, prompting dissatisfaction among many Guineans.\n\nMilitary vehicles were seen patrolling Conakry\u2019s streets in videos published on social media earlier this week, and one military source stated the sole bridge connecting the mainland to the Kaloum neighborhood, where the palace and most government ministries are located, had been closed.\n\nGuinea\u2019s bauxite, iron ore, gold, and diamond resources have underpinned economic growth during Conde\u2019s decade in office, but few of the country\u2019s population have reaped the advantages.\n\nCritics claim that the government has utilized tight criminal laws to suppress dissent, while ethnic tensions and widespread corruption have exacerbated political rivalry.\n\n\u201cWhile the president was proclaiming everywhere that he wanted to govern differently by annihilating corruption, the embezzlement of public funds increased.\n\nThe new rich were taunting us,\u201d Alassane Diallo, a resident of Conakry, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt is all this that made it easier for the military.\u201d\n\n(AFP/Reuters/NAN)",

          "text": "HURIWA, the Nigerian Human Rights Writers Association, has urged Nigerians to implore President Muhammadu Buhari to resign immediately.\n\nThe group is concerned about terrorism\u2019s increasing boundaries in the North West, as well as the extraordinary levels of armed kidnappings in Katsina, Niger, and Zamfara States, as well as armed Fulani attackers\u2019 persistent shelling of sections of Southern Kaduna State.\n\nHURIWA warned that Nigeria was eroding into a vast ungoverned vacuum, requiring collaborative action from world leaders and the United Nations to prevent the country\u2019s constitutional democracy from collapsing.\n\nBecause of the toxic body language of people in control of the political strata of power in Abuja, the rights advocacy group feels the assailants have become considerably more bold.\n\nAll of this was happening, according to the group, because all of the strategic security positions in the internal security architectures were being led by people who shared the same ethno-religious orientation as the majority of the armed terrorists who were threatening national security and getting away with it.\n\nBecause Buhari does not believe in federal character in the appointment of security chiefs, and because his repeated and serial nepotistic appointments have brought the country to the brink of collapse in the last six years, HURIWA said the next best option was to implore him to resign honorably in the name of God.\n\nHURIWA said \u201cit will be more honourable for President Buhari to tender his letter of resignation if he still loves to see Nigeria remain unbroken.\u201d\n\nThe rights group said this in a statement by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and the National Media Affairs Director Miss Zainab Yusuf and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday.\n\nThe group regretted that since 2015 \u201cthe nation has increasingly become one huge ungoverned space following the abdication of their constitutional functions by the President and the commander-In-Chier of the Armed Forces Buhari\u201d, who, according to the group, \u201chas rather chosen to focus on promoting the primordial agenda of his religion and his Fulani Ethnic nationality to the deyriment, disadvantage and endangerment of the territorial integrity and national security of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe rights group said the deeper cause of the national security crises facing Nigeria is the absence of an independent National Assembly since 2019 when the lackeys of Buhari were elected as the Senate President and Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives.\n\nIn the thinking of HURIWA, President \u201cBuhari\u2019s failure and unwillingness to decisively deal with the armed Fulani attackers because of Ethno-religious consideration is the motivation needed by such terrorist organisation like the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association to continue to threaten States that have decided to pass legislation banning open grazing of cattle.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian President at the moment has decided to fruitlessly chase after the private interest of cattle owners who are his kinsmen whilst neglecting his core function of protecting the territory of Nigeria from invasions by such armed groups.\u201d\n\nHURIWA carpeted the presidency and the National Assembly for failing to take lasting and actionable measures to combat the terror attacks while condemning the President \u201cfor failing to officially list these armed Fulani militias in those forests as terrorists and to seek clear, unambiguous international interventions by the United Nations and such nations like the United States, United Kingdom, Canada.\u201d\n\nHURIWA called on the National Assembly to move for the impeachment of President Buhari who can\u2019t protect Nigerians from \u2018favoured terrorists named bandits\u2019.\n\nHURIWA said it won\u2019t be shocking if the terrorists were able to take over the newly purchased Tucano military jets because the current administration was unwilling to wage a law-based war on terror against the armed Fulani attackers.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has lamented the deteriorating security situation in the northern part of the country.\n\nIt, however, disagreed with steps taken by some governors to curtail the menace.\n\nThe steps include suspension of weekly markets, restrictions on sale of petrol, closure of schools and roads, and imposition of curfews among others.\n\nAs part of efforts at tackling banditry and related criminals in the North, some northern state governors, including Mohammed Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, Katsina state Governor Aminu Bello Masari, Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai and their Niger state counterpart, Abubakar Sani Bello announced certain measures.\n\nThey include the ban on inter-state cattle business and specific types of petroleum sale and restriction in the operation of commercial motorcycle and tricycle (Keke NAPEP) operators.\n\nNEF differs\n\nExpressing dissatisfaction with the governors\u2019 decisions in a statement issued Sunday in Abuja; the Forum said the decisions were akin to complete lockdown of the region\u2019s economy and could only further embolden the criminals and leave the already traumatised people at their mercy.\n\nThe statement was signed by NEF\u2019s Director Publicity and Advocacy Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nNEF said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum is closely following the condition of many Northern communities that have become particularly vulnerable to attacks and abuse by bandits, kidnappers and related organized criminals.\n\n\u201cMeasures being taken by some state governments such as suspension of weekly markets, restrictions on sale of petrol, closure of schools and some roads, curfews, movement of cattle and plans to restrict communication will compound the desperate conditions of living of many communities in the North.\n\n\u201cWhile it will be unhelpful to criticize these measures without adequate knowledge of their potentials to relieve the desperation under which people live, it is important nevertheless to demand that those who have powers to impose them also have clear ideas over what they could achieve and when.\n\n\u201cThese measures represent virtual economic and social lockdowns on people who had been at the mercy of criminals for a long time. Unless they are accompanied by an aggressive and effective assault on the banditry and kidnapping industry, they will merely add to the misery and hopelessness of our communities.\n\n\u201cWorse, they could further embolden the bandit and the kidnappers when it becomes clear that governments and security agencies cannot go beyond lockdowns on communities.\n\n\u201cCommunities themselves will lose even more faith in the capacity of the Nigerian State to respond to their desperate circumstances. The perception that communities are on their own must never be allowed to take deeper roots, but it will, when people see only the bandit and the kidnapper winning.\n\n\u201cThe Forum calls on the federal government to assist states to relieve communities that are now living under additional pressures. State governments imposing additional hardships on communities must know that the measures they are introducing must produce tangible results within a period that makes them meaningful and tolerable.\u201d\n\nNiger monarch abducted\n\nAnd amidst all this, gunmen reportedly abducted the Dodo of Wawa, a traditional ruler in Wawa, Borgu local government area of Niger state, Dr Mahmud Ahmed Aliyu from his palace.\n\nThe palace is some 12 kilometres away from New Bussa where the Nigerian Army barracks is located.\n\nThe traditional ruler was reportedly kidnapped at about 9.30pm Saturday night.\n\nHe was said to have been whisked away into the Kainji National Park amidst spontaneous shooting by the hoodlums dressed in military uniform.\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen stormed the palace on motorcycles while shooting to scare away the people.\n\nConfirming the incident, the state Police command said the police were already on the bandits\u2019 trail to rescue the district head.\n\nThe command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna, said: \u201cThe police tactical team and members of the vigilante of the area have been deployed for the manhunt of the hoodlums, with a view to rescue the victim and arrest the culprits.\u201d\n\nHe called on residents to support security agencies with intelligence information to aid in the fight against banditry and kidnapping in the state.\n\nAlso, Secretary to the Niger state Government (SSG) Ahmed Ibrahim Matane told journalists in Minna that the government was doing everything possible to rescue the monarch.\n\nHe said \u201ccombined security agencies and members of vigilante group have been drafted to rescue the Dodo of Wawa unharmed.\u201d\n\nThe abduction has thrown the entire palace into confusion and uncertainty considering the frequency at which bandits now operate in the area bordering Benin Republic.\n\nLawmaker\u2019s wife, kids abducted\n\nAlso, a group of bandits attacked the home of the lawmaker representing Bakori State Constituency in Katsina state House of Assembly, Ibrahim Aminu Kurami, abducting his wife and two children.\n\nThe incident occurred between 8.00 and 9.00pm Saturday night as the bandits reportedly blocked the Funtua-Katsina Road for minutes while the abduction lasted.\n\nDuring the abduction, the bandits reportedly injured one person at the gate of the lawmaker\u2019s house.\n\nIbrahim Kurumi, the lawmaker himself was not at home as he went to Katsina after participating in the Saturday\u2019s APC council Congress in the area.\n\nIt was gathered that the local vigilante group and some residents were in pursuit of the abductors to get the victims released.\n\nJigawa title holder\n\nSimilarly, suspected gunmen Sunday kidnapped a traditional title holder, Alhaji Kabiru Ahmad and set a police vehicle ablaze in Taura local government area of Jigawa state.\n\nAccording to reports, the victim was kidnapped yesterday around 3:00am\n\nThe incident, it was gathered, occurred at about 3.00am of the fateful day when the armed hoodlums numbering about 50 on motorcycles and vehicles, entered Taura town and invaded the victim\u2019s residence.\n\nSpokesman of the state\u2019s Police command, ASP Lawan Shiisu Adam who confirmed the incident, said \u201cat about 3:00 am Police received report that a gang of armed hoodlums invaded the residence of one Alh Kabiru Ahmad and kidnapped him.\u201d\n\nHe said a team of police patrol team rushed to the scene and the hoodlums took to their heels.\n\nAdam said the police patrol team, however, pursued the criminals who in turn ambushed and opened fire on the team.\n\nThe Police spokesperson assured that efforts were on to rescue the victim and possibly apprehend the criminal elements.\n\nAdamawa shuts schools\n\nIn a related development, Adamawa state Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has directed the closure of 30 boarding schools across the state.\n\nThe governor\u2019s directive was contained in a statement by the state\u2019s Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Wilbina Jackson.\n\nThis followed heightened security concerns in the state, particularly around the schools.\n\nThe order, which takes effect from September 6, 2021, the governor said, affects 30 of the 34 boarding junior secondary schools in the state.\n\n\u201c30 boarding junior secondary schools out of the 34 schools in the state have been de-boarded with effect from September 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cFrom now henceforth, all the 30 government junior secondary schools are now day schools.\n\n\u201cThe remaining four that are not affected are Government Girls Junior Secondary School, Yola, General Murtala Mohammed College, Yola, Special School, Jada and Special School, Mubi.\n\n\u201cThis becomes necessary due to the present incessant security challenges faced by the country and owing to students\u2019 tender age,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHe directed that affected students would be distributed to the nearest public junior secondary schools.",

          "text": "\n\nThe federal government has said that the only condition to withdraw court case it filed against the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) is for its members to return to their duty post.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, said this at the weekend after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cIn the main, I discussed the state of the healthcare system industrial disputes with Mr. President. As you all know, the resident doctors are still on strike, their strike has now entered the 33rd day today. Meanwhile, government is doing everything possible to make sure they get back to work.\n\n\n\n\u201cOut of their 12-point issues raised in their demands, we have done all, we have come to agreements on all, including those that even affect the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria and medical doctors who are in academics and teaching universities.\n\n\u201cSo, we have handled all, the only point of disagreement now is that they said that the agreements and the memorandum of action, government should inserts, include that Section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act will not apply to them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat section says that when a worker withdraws his services from his employer, the employer is at liberty to withhold payment of emoluments to him and the ILO principles at work and strike said you can use that money to pay other people you have engaged in that particular period of strike.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you have a right to strike, but your employer also has the right to withhold your emolument. More importantly, in other climes, before unions go on strike, by that principle, they discuss with their workers and bring out what they call strike funds and it\u2019s from that strike funds that the union will use to pay the workers have gone on strike. They will also agree on the number of days the strike will last.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why overseas and in other climes, you don\u2019t see strikes getting more than three days or four days or five days, highest and more importantly again, people on essential services, medical services, in particular, where you can lose live, they don\u2019t go on strike any anyhow. They only do picketing and things like that, because people\u2019s lives are involved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said government\u2019s decision to implement the \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 policy remains in line with global practice as captured in Section 43 of the Trade Dispute Act under the International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\n\u201cThis is where we are with them and we are saying that even if anybody cares to put it in any agreement, that clause will be void ab initio because it\u2019s against the law of the land and we will not, as a government, succumb to undue arm twisting and then go and sign that. Other workers have lost their pay during strikes; the Joint Health Systems Union JOHESU), they lost their pay in 2018 when they went on four months strike, they lost about two or three months pay when the no-work, no-pay was invoked.\n\n\n\n\u201cAcademic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), no-work, no-pay applied to them. Nobody paid them anything for six months and it was during COVID-19. So, we can handle things administratively, but nobody should arm-twist.\n\n\u201cI briefed Mr. President and we\u2019ve agreed that they should come back to work and if they come back to work, we can take other things from there; we\u2019ll drop the case in court and then they will come back and get things done.\n\n\u201cThe Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, in conjunction with the Office of the Head of Service, had a meeting and they are jointly going to do a circular that will be issued for Salaries, Incomes and Wages to reiterate that the House Officers and Youth Corps doctors are still on CONMES scale, one and two respectively. So, I think we are doing the implementation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister also told journalists that 2000 unqualified names on Residency Training Fund list, stressing that 588 would make refund of payment to government.\n\n\u201cFrom the monitoring meeting we did this morning, Ministry of Health has gotten the list of doctors who supposedly are to benefit from the Medical Residency Training Fund. Total submission of about 8000 names were gotten and the Ministry of Health is scrutinising them, we have done the first round or scrutinization and they will now compare what they have with the Post-Graduate Medical College and the Chief Medical Directors who submitted the names.\n\n\u201cThe Association of Resident Doctors, in each of the tertiary centres, worked with the CMDs to produce those names, but now that the names are being verified, we discovered that about 2000 names shouldn\u2019t be there because they don\u2019t have what is called Postgraduate Reference Numbers of National Postgraduate Medical College and or that of the West African Postgraduate Medical College.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, this is it and that is the only thing holding back the Residency Fund payment because it is there already for\u2026 incurred expenditure has been done by the Finance Minister and an it\u2019s in the Accountant-General\u2019s office. So, once the verify they authenticity of those they are submitting, the Accountant-General will pay.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are doing that verification because we do not want what happened last time in 2020 to reoccur; in 2020 the submitted names didn\u2019t come through the appropriate source, which is the Postgraduate Medical College and payment was affected and it was discovered that about 588 persons, who were not resident doctors benefited from such money and they are now finding it difficult to make the full refund, but they have to refund that money. Some are refunding, but there is no full consideration of the account. That account has to be reconciled to enable the accountants pay the next round of funding for 2021.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I briefed Mr. President on and we also discussed some policies, which is not for public consumption now. We take it in its stride as the days come by, but we discuss politics, the state of our party, nationally and in my,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, said this at the weekend after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\nAs you all know, the resident doctors are still on strike, their strike has now entered the 33rd day today.\n\u201cSo, you have a right to strike, but your employer also has the right to withhold your emolument.\nThey will also agree on the number of days the strike will last.\nWe take it in its stride as the days come by, but we discuss politics, the state of our party, nationally and in my,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

          "text": "It\u2019s been a tough period for many Nigerians living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), especially those in Dubai, as they lament the loss of jobs and difficulty in obtaining a work permit.\n\nBisi Kazeem, one of the affected Nigerians, believes authorities in the Middle East country are punishing them for the sins of a few.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I can only say maybe it is one out of 10, or 10 out of 100 Nigerians that are doing the bad things,\u201d he told Channels Television. \u201cEvery other person is facing his/her job.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIt has not been easy at all. I have been feeding from hand to mouth. Even as I speak, in the next two to three days, the rent here will expire. I don\u2019t even know how I am going to pay the owner.\u201d\n\nReports of a ban on work permits for Nigerians living in the UAE first surfaced over two months ago.\n\nSince then, hundreds of legitimate workers have lost their jobs, or have been unable to secure new employment. The effect, for most, has been devastating.\n\n\u201cWe are starving here,\u201d Azeez Akogun, a technician, said. \u201cWe are facing a lot of stress. A lot of people are being frustrated; I am being frustrated. Every day, being at home without any income; so, it\u2019s kind of crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never had any issue with my company,\u201d said Olabanji Folorunsho who is still in shock after he was relieved of his security job. \u201cNot a single warning letter from my company.\u201d\n\nAn Attack On Migrants?\n\nOfficials at the Nigerian Embassy in the UAE say they are doing everything in their power to resolve the issue, but the question the victims are asking is for how long?\n\n\u201cI am begging them (UAE authorities) to lift the ban so I can continue my job,\u201d a disturbed Kazeem pleaded. \u201cThey should just pity we the innocent ones so that in the nearest future, one will not become a destitute or a nuisance in the land of UAE.\u201d\n\nCrime rate is said to have been rising among foreigners in the UAE. Earlier this year, videos surfaced online, showing the aftermath of a violent cultist-related altercation linked to Nigerians \u2013 an incident many believe has now led to work restrictions.\n\nSimilarly, in February, it was reported online that an Indian was robbed of Rs 55,30,806 by four Nigerian women in Dubai. The 33-year-old man was reportedly lured into a fake massage parlour through a dating app.\n\nFollowing an investigation, Dubai Police say three women were arrested in Sharjah \u2013 a city also in the UAE \u2013 in connection with the crime.\n\nAmid concerns raised by law-abiding Nigerians and nationals of other African nations said to have also been affected, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor and ImpACT International released a joint report on Thursday.\n\nThe document, titled \u201cThey told us that they hated black Africans,\u201d contains alleged widespread state-sponsored violations of human rights on African migrant workers in the UAE.\n\nAccording to the international bodies, the report was compiled based on about 100 interviews with migrant workers from Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda, and over 20 of those who spoke confirmed a massive campaign of arrests against African workers in the UAE.\n\n\u2018They Were Just Laughing At Us\u2019\n\nThe workers said the attacks, carried out on June 24 and 25 allegedly by authorities, were planned, targeted, and racially motivated.\n\nAt least 800 workers were reportedly taken over the course of two nights, with an unknown number still under detention. Many were said to have been deported despite having valid residence visas and/or work permits.\n\n\u201cI was kidnapped on 25 June at 2am on my bed sleeping,\u201d Melachio Carlos, a Cameroonian who worked as a waiter, was quoted as saying in the 54-page report. \u201cThey took me and asked about my ID, passport, valid residency permit, and phone.\n\n\u201cThey stole everything in my room. They beat me and took me half-naked, only with my sleeping clothes, to Al Wathba prison in Abu Dhabi. We arrived there and they put us in prison. They also took our wives, some of them were pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey took us to the prison, and when we got there, they did not give sanitary pads for the women who were doing their menstrual cycle,\u201d a Ugandan nanny, Catherine Kuheisa, said. \u201cBlood was running down their legs and when we went to ask for pads, they were just laughing at us.\u201d\n\nThe UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) is responsible for issuing work permits to foreigners willing to work in the country.\n\nAccording to the law of the country \u2013 Article 1 of Ministerial Decree No. 766 of 2015, a worker whose employment is terminated due to contract expiration can get a new work permit whenever he/she wishes to join new employment.\n\nThe law also allows an employee to get a new work permit for all limited and non-limited contracts if it is determined that the employer has failed to meet the legal and contractual obligations, among other conditions.\n\nIn his reaction, the UAE Ambassador in Nigeria, Dr Fahad Obaid Al Taffaq, stated that the said ban is not official and not from UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cFrom what I believe as an official position from the UAE, the UAE is a very welcoming country. We have no discrimination against any nationality,\u201d Taffaq said in a conversation with the Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa.",

          "text": "Army putschists in Guinea said on Sunday they had arrested the president and staged a coup, in the latest political upheaval to roil the impoverished west African country, as the government insisted it had repelled the attack.\n\n\u201cWe have decided, after having taken the president, to dissolve the constitution,\u201d said a uniformed officer flanked by soldiers toting assault rifles in a video sent to AFP.\n\nThe officer also said that Guinea\u2019s land and air borders have been shut and the government dissolved.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tanzania In New Crackdown On Opposition Party\n\nBut the situation remained unclear as Conde\u2019s government released a rival statement saying that an attack on the presidential palace by special forces had been \u201crepulsed\u201d.\n\nAnother video sent to AFP by the putschists showed a rumpled-looking President Alpha Conde sitting on a sofa, surrounded by troops. He refused to answer a question from one soldier about whether he was being mistreated.\n\nGuinea \u2014 one of the world\u2019s poorest countries despite boasting significant mineral resources \u2014 has long been beset by political instability.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, residents of the capital Conakry\u2019s Kaloum district, the government quarter, reported hearing heavy gunfire.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity for their safety, they reported seeing a number of soldiers on the streets who called on residents to return to their homes and stay there.\n\nA Western diplomat in Conakry, who also declined to be named, said the unrest started after the dismissal of a senior commander in the special forces \u2014 provoking some of its highly trained members to rebel and occupy the presidential palace.\n\nAFP was unable to independently confirm this account.\n\nLater on Sunday, the head of Guinea\u2019s military special forces Lieutenant-Colonel Mamady Doumbouya appeared on public television, draped in the national flag, and cited government \u201cmismanagement\u201d as a reason behind his actions.\n\nThe apparent coup comes amid a long period of political tension in Guinea, first spurred by Conde\u2019s highly contested bid for a third presidential term last year.\n\nThe day before the presidential election last year, the military blocked access to Kaloum after an alleged military rebellion east of the capital.\n\nConde, 83, also survived an assassination attempt in 2011.\n\nViolent Elections\n\nThe most recent presidential poll in the nation of some 13 million people, in October 2020, was violently disputed and also marred by accusations of electoral fraud.\n\nConde won a controversial third term in that poll, but only after pushing through a new constitution in March 2020 that allowed him to sidestep the country\u2019s two-term limit.\n\nDozens of people were killed during demonstrations against a third term for the president, often in clashes with security forces. Hundreds were also arrested.\n\nConde was then proclaimed president on November 7 last year \u2014 despite his main challenger Cellou Dalein Diallo as well as other opposition figures calling the election a sham.\n\nAfter the poll, the government launched a crackdown and arrested several prominent opposition members for their alleged role in abetting electoral violence in the country.\n\nA former opposition leader himself who was at one point imprisoned and sentenced to death, Conde became Guinea\u2019s first democratically-elected leader in 2010 and won re-election in 2015.\n\nHopes of a new political dawn in the former French colony have withered, however, and he has been accused of drifting into authoritarianism.\n\nAFP",

They murdered and butchered their victims with dangerous weapons. Unfortunately, the unarmed, peaceful and defenseless locals are now at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cBy a reliable records, no fewer than fifteen people have gruesomely been murdered by the marauding criminals. Six people were confirmed dead at Unguwan Magiro under Madaka Ward, Rafi local government area, four people at Farin Hula and five people at Magami and environs all under Manta Ward of Shiroro local government while scores of others are still missing \u2013 probably killed too\u201d Kukoki said.\n\nThe Kukoki stated further that many villagers have now fled to Kuta headquarters of the local government and other neighboring villages where they are now staying as Internally Displaced People.\n\n\u201cKuta the headquarters of Shiroro local government which is considered a safer ground is swelling up with fleeing IDPs who have since vacated the troubled areas scampering helter skelter for shelter, peace and security\u201d Kukoki said in the statement.\n\nKukoki suggested that the \u201cOnslaught against criminals need to be a sustained one in order to avoid a replica of this nature\u201d adding that: \u201csustained operation can go a long way in halting or avoiding any possible reprisal that could result into unwanted casualties\u201d.\n\nThe Concerned Shiroro Youths, he said is therefore calling with \u201ca loud voice on the authorities concerned to immediately mobilize security personnel as well as local Vigilantes and station same at Magami which is now the epicenter of atrocities being perpetrated by dreaded criminals so as to restore security in the area\u201d.\n\nThis, according to him, will guarantee peace and enable the locals to continue with their lawful and legitimate activities.\n\nAll attempts to reach the Chairman of the Local Government Council, Alhaji Sulaiman Chikuba, via phone were futile because he did not answer his cell phone despite multiple calls.\n\nA Government official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the attacks on Kukoki, Bassa, Magami and Madaka villages saying \u201cthey attacked and kill many people but the number is yet to be ascertained\u201d.",

          "text": "The governments of Lagos and Rivers states have announced their preparedness to begin collecting Value Added Tax, following a Federal High Court ruling in Port Harcourt that states, not the Federal Inland Revenue Service, should be collecting VAT and Personal Income Tax.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has already signed into law the bill authorizing the state to collect VAT, while the Lagos State Government has stated that it has already alerted all stakeholders engaged in the payment and receipt of VAT of its intention to enforce the judgment to the letter.\n\nThis is in spite of the opposition by the FIRS, which already filed an appeal against the judgment, and some northern states, who said they preferred the Federal Government to continue collecting the tax.\n\nJustice Stephen Pam, who delivered the judgment on August 10, 2021, also restrained the FIRS and the Attorney General of the Federation from demanding the taxes from the residents of the Rivers State, which by implication affects other states.\n\nVAT is charged on the supply of goods and services in Nigeria, including those imported into the country, except the goods and services specifically exempted under the VAT Act.\n\nBy virtue of the Finance Act 2020, which took effect on February 1, 2020, the Value Added Tax charged on affected goods and services rose from five per cent to 7.5 per cent. Yearly, VAT contributes significantly to the total revenue generated by the government.\n\nPrior to the court ruling, the FIRS, a federal government agency, was in charge of collecting VAT on behalf of the 36 states and the FCT. The money is split among the three levels of government, with the federal government receiving 15%, states 50%, and local governments 35%.\n\nWhile signing the Valued Added Tax Law No. 4 of 2021 and some other bills into law, Wike said, \u201cWe (Rivers State) The governments of Lagos and Rivers states have expressed their readiness to begin the collection of Value Added Tax in accordance with the judgement of a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, which ruled that states, and not the Federal Inland Revenue Service, should be collecting VAT and Personal Income Tax.\n\nAlready, the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, had signed into law the bill that empowers the state to collect VAT, while the Lagos State Government said it had already notified all the stakeholders involved in the payment and receipt of VAT of its resolve to enforce the judgement to the letter.\n\nThis is in spite of the opposition by the FIRS, which already filed an appeal against the judgment, and some northern states, who said they preferred the Federal Government to continue collecting the tax.\n\nJustice Stephen Pam, who delivered the judgment on August 10, 2021, also restrained the FIRS and the Attorney General of the Federation from demanding the taxes from the residents of the Rivers State, which by implication affects other states.\n\nVAT is charged on the supply of goods and services in Nigeria, including those imported into the country, except the goods and services specifically exempted under the VAT Act.\n\nBy virtue of the Finance Act 2020, which took effect on February 1, 2020, the Value Added Tax charged on affected goods and services rose from five per cent to 7.5 per cent. Yearly, VAT contributes significantly to the total revenue generated by the government.\n\nPrior to the court judgment, however, the FIRS, an agency of the Federal Government, had the responsibility of collecting VAT on behalf of the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory. The sum collected is then shared among the three tiers of government, with the Federal Government taking 15 per cent, the states 50 per cent; local governments 35 per cent.\n\nWhile signing the Valued Added Tax Law No. 4 of 2021 and some other bills into law, Wike said, \u201cWe (Rivers State) are standing on the part of history as representatives of the state to have taken the bull by the horns to challenge the illegality of the Federal Government through the Federal inland Revenue Services.\u201d\n\nJustifying the reason for filing the suit, Wike added, \u201cIn this Rivers State, we awarded contracts to companies and within the last month, we paid over N30bn to the contractors and 7.5 per cent will now be deducted from that and to be given to FIRS.\n\n\u201cNow, look at 7.5 per cent of N30bn of contracts we awarded to companies in Rivers State, you will be talking about almost N3bn only from that source. Now, at the end of the month, Rivers State government has never received more than N2bn from VAT. So, I have contributed more through the award of the contract and you are giving me less. What\u2019s the justification for it?\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Strategy in Lagos State,Mr Gbenga Omotosho, stated that the state government will begin implementing the court judgment as soon as possible, even if it meant sending a bill to the House of Assembly to alter the applicable laws.\n\nHe said the judgment was a reflection of true federalism and the state government had already notified all the stakeholders involved in the payment and receipt of VAT of its resolve to enforce it.\n\nOmotosho stated, \u201cWe are aware of the judgment and we applauded it. In a federation, that is the way it goes. In our pursuit of true federalism, it is a giant step forward. And in fact, we have notified all our stakeholders about the judgment that the Lagos State Government will implement it.\n\n\u201cWe are writing to all the stakeholders to let them know that this is a judgment we are going to obey to the letter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there has been an uneasy silence surrounding the decision, because tax experts estimate that no fewer than 30 states will see a significant loss in revenue from the federal allocation, which is the states\u2019 primary source of revenue.\n\nMrs Kemi Adeosun, the former Minister of Finance, claimed in August 2017 that Lagos State collected 55% of the Federal Government\u2019s VAT revenue, with the remaining 45% coming from the other 35 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nFiscal Policy Partner and the Africa Tax Leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mr Taiwo Oyedele, had earlier told The PUNCH that the biggest losers would be the states, except Lagos.\n\n\u201cA few states like Kano, Rivers, Oyo, Kaduna, Delta and Katsina may experience minimal impact, while at least 30 states, which account for less than 20 per cent of VAT collection, will suffer significant revenue decline,\u201d he added.\n\nConsequently, apart from the FIRS, some states in the north have also expressed their opposition to the judgement, given the impact it would have on their revenue and how it could worsen their already shaky economy. Some of the states had in the past relied on bailout from the Federal Government to pay salaries.\n\nVAT has been a major contributor to the consolidated revenue fund. In 2020, for example, total VAT collection was about N1.53tn, with import VAT being N348bn while foreign non-import VAT was N420bn and local VAT amounted to N763bn.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021 alone, the National Bureau of Statistics disclosed that the country generated N496.39bn from VAT, which was an improvement on the N324.58bn it earned in the same period in 2020.\n\nApart from the FIRS, some governors in the northern part of the country have also kicked against the judgment.\n\nThe Plateau State Commissioner for Information, Dan Manjang, said on Friday that the Federal Government should continue to collect the VAT, arguing that states tend to benefit more if the FIRS is allowed to handle the collection.\n\nIn Gombe State, the Chairman, Internal Revenue Service, Abubakar Tata, argued that states lacked the capacity to effectively carry out that responsibility, noting that the consumption tax states were allowed to collect had not been optimally done.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere are certain taxes that the Federal Government collects on behalf of the states because we have the Joint Tax Board account where all the collection regarding Value Added Tax is paid into and later shared based on the allocation formula. If you allow state governments to begin to collect tax, will it be effective? After all, the states have consumption tax which is five per cent of what is consumed at restaurants, event centres and other services.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, not all the states are collecting the consumption tax because of issues like capacity, enforcement and other issues surrounding tax administration at the lower level, particularly at the state level. If you strip the Federal Government of the power to compel any company or taxpaying entity operating in Nigeria to make the payment and you give the power to states, the level of collection we are seeing at the moment will not be the same.\u201d\n\nWhile questioning the decision of Rivers State Government to test collection of VAT in court, he stressed that the state might not have appropriately enforced consumption tax because of politics.\n\nHe added, \u201cAt the moment, Gombe is implementing the new tax law in phases and we are distributing letters to all relevant taxpaying entities because we are expected to collect five per cent from the services they render and remit it to the Internal Revenue Service. We are, at the moment, raising awareness through the mass media.\n\n\u201cAssuming all states are collecting the consumption tax as it is enshrined in the state law then we can say we have the capacity and the legal framework to do it and remit the same to our Internal Revenue service.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we lack the capacity to execute that mandate because even the consumption tax, if you go to Rivers, go and find out how much they are able to collect under consumption tax. It\u2019s for politics, somehow to overheat the polity and the economic stabilisation of the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nIn Borno State, a top government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no state in the North would want the enforcement of the judgment because it would make the prices of goods rise beyond the reach of the people.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe wisdom behind allowing the Federal Government to receive the taxes on behalf of the states at the point of entry through the then Federal Inland Revenue Agency was to normalise prices and distribute to all states through the Federal Accounts Allocation Committee after deducting 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe general consensus among the states is that the judge that delivered that judgment did not have the complete information about the service because if he did, he would have understood the idea behind the Federal Government receiving the VAT.\u201d\n\nThe official stressed that if all states were to collect their VAT respectively, people, including the rich, would find things expensive to buy.\n\nHe added, \u201cFor example, here in Borno State, if we are transporting trucks loaded with rice from Lagos down to Maiduguri, how many states will that truck pass through before getting to Borno. If the truck refuses to pay VAT, that state will impound the car.\n\n\u201cThe states came together and discussed that all consumables should be charged uniformly and FIRS was appointed to collect the VAT and share among the states. We agreed on the percentage to be deducted by the Federal Government, which is 15 per cent and, considering the total amount being realised and shared, that percentage is small and negligible.\u201d\n\nIn Adamawa State, the Director-General, Media and Communications in the state, Solomon Kumangar, who spoke to one of our correspondents on Friday, said the matter was of interest to the state, noting that the state would like to be joined should the Federal Government appeal the judgment and the case proceeds to the Supreme Court.\n\nHe added, \u201cAnything to extend and improve on our IGR is welcomed. So, we are keen on joining Rivers State Government should the Federal Government appeal the judgment which granted Rivers State the right to collect VAT. That is because whatever will bring improvement in IGR is a welcome idea for a state like Adamawa just recovery from the ravages of insurgency.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the collection of VAT by the states is the only way to assist states who are heavily dependent on federal allocations to be able to wean themselves and meet their fiduciary obligations. So, if there are areas where revenues can be exploited and extended, surely the state government will welcome it.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Governor Bello Masari of Katsina State, while receiving a delegation from the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, had said the state had also appealed the judgment, vowing that the court\u2019s decision would not stand.\n\n\u201cWe have heard the judgment of the Federal High Court in Rivers and we have appealed against that judgment. It means people will begin to pay double VAT because if you pay VAT in Kano, at the point of departure, it means when you come to Katsina you pay another VAT.\n\n\u201cIf you pay VAT in Lagos, it means you also pay VAT all along the way until you reach your destination. It will bring a lot of burden on the people. That judgment is not fair. It is other parts of the country that make Lagos and Rivers states what they are. We have to work together as a nation and come up with something that will work for all of us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kaduna and Niger states said they had yet to take on a position on the issue as they were still studying the judgement.\n\nThe Executive Chairman, Niger State Internal Revenue Service, Mohammed Madami Etsu, told one of our correspondents that once the state took a decision, it would be made public.\n\n\u201cWe are still studying the judgment and the decision of the state would be made public once a decision is taken on the matter but for now, I cannot say much about it,\u201d Etsu said.\n\nAlso, also the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ibrahim Matane, said he could not make any statement on it because it was a policy issue that needed to be discussed at the state executive level.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make any statement on it because it is a matter that needs to be discussed at policy level. We are a federation and individual states would want to collect it by themselves but there are consequences to such a decision. This is a policy issue that needs extensive deliberation at the state executive level,\u201d Matane added.\n\nIn Kaduna State, the Special Assistant to Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Muyiwa Adekeye, told one of our correspondents in an interview on Friday that the state was studying the judgment to understand its details, impact and ramifications.\n\nAdekeye noted that the state remained a champion of true federalism, anchored on significant devolution of powers and responsibilities to the states, adding that the state focused intensely on expanding its IGR, enabling it to increase its IGR from N13bn in 2015 to N50.2bn in 2020.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Kaduna State Government is a champion of true federalism, anchored on significant devolution of powers and responsibilities to the states. Kaduna State has also focused intensely on expanding its internally generated revenue. The El-Rufai government has almost quadrupled IGR to N50.2bn in 2020, from N13bn in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe state government is still studying the VAT judgment to understand its details, impact and ramifications.\u201d",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has intervened in the ongoing strike by members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors, according to reports.\n\nThe NARD declared a strike on July 30 at a meeting of its National Executive Council, with the theme \u2018The Nigerian doctor, an endangered species: grappling with a pandemic, poor workplace infrastructure and security threats.\u2019\n\nThe National President of NARD, Dr Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, announced the strike would begin on August 2 after a meeting in Umuahia, Abia State. He highlighted the Federal Government\u2019s failure to implement the agreements reached with the union 113 days after the previous strike was suspended.\n\nHowever, 33 days after the commencement of the strike, Osinbajo reached out to the doctors in a bid to find a lasting solution to the crisis.\n\nTVC news gathered that the vice president had a zoom meeting with one of the officials of the doctors\u2019 association on Friday where issues relating to the strike were discussed.\n\nVice President of NARD, Adejo Arome, confirmed that the vice president had a zoom meeting with an official of the association on Friday.\n\nAccording to Arome, while reaching out to the association, the Vice President said he needed first-hand information on the issues involved.\n\n\u201cHe told us that he did not want the issue to be resolved now and later there would be another strike.\n\n\u201cHe said he wants to put the problem to rest once and for all. We are waiting for him to invite us officially and we are certain that he is going to do it. We trust his judgement.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Medical Association said the Federal Government has yet to reach out to the association.\n\nNotwithstanding, the association stated that the 21-day strike notice it issued to the Federal Government stands regardless.\n\nThe association\u2019s General Secretary, Dr Philips Ekpe, disclosed this in an interview with in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the notice period was to enable the Federal Government to attend to the lingering issues with the NMA\u2019s affiliate members.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 21-day notice was to give the government time to meet the demands of our affiliate members such as NARD, Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria and Medical and Dental Specialist Association in Basic Medical Sciences.\n\n\u201cApparently, nothing has been forthcoming as they have not reached out to us and even NARD and as you are aware, the matter with NARD is still in the court of law.\n\n\u201cOnce government cooperates and attends to the demands of NARD and the other affiliates, then there won\u2019t be any problem.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the ultimatum, if things don\u2019t meet our expectations, the National Executive Council of our association will take decisions.\n\n\u201cOn the issues of the salary of resident doctors that was withheld, we are working behind closed doors to make sure that things are resolved.\u201d\n\nThe NMA had on August 28 issued a 21-day strike notice to the Federal Government, with effect from Monday, August 30.\n\nThe NMA and all of its affiliates agreed at the end of their National Executive Council meeting in Benin City, Edo State, to give the Federal Government 21 days to properly resolve all of the issues mentioned in the different agreements struck with the doctors.\n\nWhile the Federal Government is currently trying to end the Resident Doctors\u2019 strike, members of the Joint Health Sector Unions and the Assembly of Healthcare Professional Association have threatened to go on strike in 15 days if the government does not accept their demands.\n\nJOHESU\u2019s National President, Mr Biobelemonye Josiah, gave the ultimatum in a letter addressed to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nCopy of the letter was made available to journalists on Saturday in Abuja.\n\nJosiah said that the 15-day ultimatum was necessitated by the nonchalant attitude of the government to the plight of his members.\n\nHe added that his association and APHA are demanding an adjustment to the Consolidated Health Salary Structure, as was done with the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure since 2014; payment of all withheld April and May 2018 Salaries of members, as well as withheld Salaries in the Federal Medical Center, Owerri, Jos University Hospital, and Lagos University Teaching Hospital.\n\nOthers include the review of the defective implementation of COVID-19 Special Inducement and Hazard Allowance; implementation of National Industrial Court of Nigeria Alternative Dispute Resolution, Consent judgment and other court judgments; increase in retirement age from 60 to 65 years for health workers and 70 years for Consultant Health Professionals.\n\n\u201cOthers are payment of reviewed hazard allowance in terms of payment that guarantees fairness and justice to all concerned, payment of actual 30 per cent consolidated basic shift duty allowance to Nurses/Midwives and others.\n\n\u201dPayment of teaching allowance to members on CONHESS 7 and 8 (nurses, midwives and others) and proper placement of Nurse Graduates and Interns,\u201d he said.\n\nJosiah said their demands also include payment of outstanding salaries of intern health professionals and all the Tertiary Health Institutions, proper implementation of the consultant pharmacist cadre for pharmacists in the public sector, among others.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Federal Government has not deemed it fit to honour the Terms of Settlement entered into with JOHESU since September 2017.\n\n\u201cThis is especially the upward review of CONHESS Salary Structure as agreed, to be completed within five weeks from the date of agreement amongst other requests. The Government did not deem it fit to address these key issues during the duration of the last seven days warning strike and has only met with JOHESU on July 12,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn July 2020, the Minister of Health agreed that a mistake was made by government in the payment of COVID-19 Special Inducement and Hazard Allowances. He noted that the shortfall was in the payment of 50 per cent Basic of Consolidated allowances to all Health Workers. It was a mistake on the part of government and the shortfall shall be paid accordingly to affected health workers.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than 1,851 Nigerian-trained medical doctors acquired a total of 3,649 licenses to be able to practice in the United States of America in five years, investigations by have revealed\n\nIt was also gathered that physicians in the US could acquire multiple licenses which would allow them to practice in the country and other territories.\n\nThe Vice President, Communications, Federation of State Medical Board in the United States, Joe Knickrehm, confirmed that more Nigerians were actually trooping to the US to practice.\n\nHe further disclosed in an email exchange with our correspondent, that physicians in the US could acquire multiple licenses which would allow them to practice in the US and other territories.\n\nThe mail partly read, \u201cPhysicians can have multiple licenses to practice medicine in the United States if they wish to practice in multiple states or US territories.\n\n\u201cBetween 2015 and 2020, a total of 1,851 Nigeria-educated physicians have been issued with a total of 3,649 licenses. 75 per cent of these physicians, who were issued licenses between these periods that is 1,388, are actively practicing in the US.\n\n\u201cAs of 2020, 3,895 Nigeria-educated physicians with a total of 6,536 full active licenses are practicing in the US.\u201d\n\nPresident of the National Association of Resident Doctors, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, however, said one of the reasons why physicians were eager to leave Nigeria was that they were not allowed to acquire multiple licenses which could enable them to practice in various fields.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn Nigeria, there is no such thing; you cannot have multiple licenses. You are only entitled to one license.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why you see doctors leaving the country. When you visit these other countries, you can acquire medical licenses to practice in other fields.\u201d",

          "text": "The United Arab Emirates announced a new class of visas on Sunday, the latest step in a series of moves aimed at attracting talent and boosting growth.\n\n\u201cGreen Visas\u201d will allow expatriates to apply for work without being sponsored by an employer, targeting investors and highly skilled workers as well as top students and graduates. Green visa holders will be able to sponsor their parents and children up to the age of 25 on their permits.\n\nThe government also said it would allow people who\u2019ve lost their jobs to remain in the country for up to 180 days, a major incentive as most visas are tied to employment contracts. And in an effort to loosen the job market, it\u2019s allowing for the hiring of temporary workers above the age of 15.\n\nForeign residents make up more than 80% of the population of the UAE and have been a mainstay of the economy for decades, doing most private sector jobs and spending their money on property or shopping in some of the world\u2019s largest malls.\n\nOil-rich Gulf states have long resisted offering permanent residency, let alone citizenship, to their millions of foreign workers, guarding generous privileges enjoyed by their nationals. But forced by the 2014 oil-price slump to prepare their economies for a post-fossil fuel world, they are now seeking to entice wealthy people to stay, a trend that was reinforced during the Covid-19 pandemic, when governments took steps to ensure those who lost their jobs could remain.\n\nBoth Saudi Arabia and Qatar have taken steps toward allowing some expatriates permanent residency.\n\nBloomberg",
