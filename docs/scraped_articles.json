          "title": "Lagos CSOs rally against Shell operations in Nigeria",
          "text": "A broad-based coalition of civil society organisations comprising people of the Niger Delta region, environmental activists, representatives of host oil and gas communities, human rights groups, students, youths, artisans, and media practitioners, on Monday, held a rally at the office of the British oil and gas company, Shell PLC, Marina, in Lagos.\n\nThe CSOs were asking that Shell should stop oil and gas extraction in Nigeria, and urged investors to stop funding Shell\u2019s operations, owing to the environmental damage that the company\u2019s operations were allegedly causing to the water, land, and human resources in Nigeria.\n\nThey equally called for a limit of global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius pre-industrial level, and demanded, amongst others, an end to carbon emission. They equally called for a people-centred transition from fossil fuel to clean energy in Nigeria as well as the clean-up of the Ogoni land and the entire Niger Delta region.\n\nThe coalition which was led by the Africa Network for Environmental and Economic Justice had on Sunday, issued a resolution at a people\u2019s Annual General Meeting, a shadow CSOs AGM to Shell\u2019s AGM scheduled for May 24, 2022. The AGM resolutions signed by its leadership, the Convener \u2013 Rev. David Ugolor and Co-Chairmen \u2013 Legborsi Pyagbara and Taiwo Otitolaye, concluded that:\n\n\u201cNigerian oil-bearing communities and citizens who are the victims of Shell and other international oil and gas companies have voted an emphatic \u201cNO\u201d to shell\u2019s Energy Transition Strategy.\n\n\u201cThe Church of England and other investors should stop lending moral and financial support to shell and should vote against Shell\u2019s energy transition strategy at the May 24, 2022, AGM.\n\n\u201cWe call on the investors to immediately embark on a Fact-Finding Mission in collaboration with the civil society actors to ascertain the true situation of Shell\u2019s operations in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cShell should go back to the drawing board and revise the 2021 energy transition strategy to align with the Paris Agreement of limiting the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\n\u201cGiven the inherent dangers of any further investment to the attainment of net-zero target poses, Shell should immediately commence a process of winding down the process of further exploration of fossil fuel in Nigeria. Increasing investment in oil and gas as evidenced in its current strategy must cease.\n\n\u201cShell should cut down emission at source rather than targeting nature-based solution.\n\n\u201cKey stakeholders driving the clean-up of Ogoni land should do the needful to remove the impediments to actualising the smooth implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations Environment Programme report.\n\n\u201cWe call on Shell\u2019s AGM to commit to a comprehensive cleanup of the entire Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Ejike Mbaka has set the agenda of competence, industrialisation, humility, sanity, religiosity and vision drive for whoever would become the next governor of Enugu state in 2023.\n\nMbaka set the agenda when one of governorship aspirants in the state and former Minister for Power, Prof. Bart Nnaji celebrated mass at the Adoration ground officiated by the priest in Emene, on Sunday.\n\nHe prayed God to fulfill Nnaji\u2019s desires and to guide Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in the decision of who to settle for as his preferred successor.\n\nMbaka described Nnaji as an industrialist and a power generator who has the annoting of God in his endeavor, asking God to grant Nnaji\u2019s will in his aspiration to become the next governor of Enugu state.\n\nMbaka said: \u201cHe (Bart Nnaji) is one of the governorship aspirants in Enugu and he has come to be with us. He is a great son of Wawa, a great man in the land of Umuode, a power generator. It will be well with you. My prayer for you is that the will of God be done.\n\n\u201cOne of my children will become the Governor after Gburugburu ( Governor Ugwuanyi). We are also prayering for Gburugburu so that God will give him the wisdom, the grace, the favour to select a man after God\u2019s own heart. That is my prayer for him in Jesus name.\n\n\u201cThe person of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is in tandem with peace. There may not be too much flyovers in Enugu but there is peace. By midnight you see the people of Enugu walking about the streets fearlessly without security. The white men that came here the other day assessed it and I thank God for the good people of Enugu State that supported him to achieve it. The youths of Enugu, it shall be well with you.\n\n\u201cSo, that is why I am praying for Gburugburu so that he will not make a mistake because one single mistake will put people in trouble. None of the politicians who are aspiring to be governor will expose his inner will. What you see are people who are not real. None of them is saying things from their heart, but we are waiting. Anyone they bring we will work for the people. If he wants peace, we will give him peace, if he wants to toy with the poor, we will chase him out of the seat.\n\n\u201cBut we are praying so that God will give us someone who is sane, a tested and trusted personality, a competent hand, a father, a lover, an industrialist, a visionary, a godly person, a down to earth humble personality. We need a compassionate, empathic and sympathetic personality. Someone with a good heart and a good person.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need terrorism in this state. We don\u2019t want to hear that this one is in this cult while the other person is in another cult and then a cult war will start. They are all our children but we need a father to be governor so he will bring the the entire Enugu together. Anyone who enters Enugu will know that he has entered a land of peace.\n\n\u201cBecause our people can survive even if you don\u2019t help them. My prayer is that he selects a man of peace, a good man. I am not recommending anyone to him but I am praying that God puts a good man into his heart.\u201d",

          "text": "ADC, PRP, NNPP, SDP, APM to contest on banner LP\n\nJega, Utomi, Dansadau, others to lead coalition of Allied Parties\n\nUtomi urges mind shift in readiness for post APC/PDP Nigeria\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nAFTER 15 months of discussion and engagements, six parties, on the banner of Allied political parties, and the National Consultative Front, NCFront, the umbrella body of the Third Force Movement, have agreed to join forces with the Labour Party, LP, to present a joint presidential and other candidates for the 2023 polls.\n\nThis adoption of the Labour Party was made possible by the new rapprochement between the leadership of the Labour Movement and the hierarchy of the Labour Party- an emergent solidarity jointly spearheaded by President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Ayuba Wabba; and the Trade Union Congress, TUC President, Quadri Olaleye, who have revalidated their membership of the Labour Party by formally registering with the party, last week.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ms Bilikis Bello, NCFront communications executive, the formal endorsement of the Labour Party by the \u20183rd Force\u2019 Movement arose from recent meetings and activities of separate political commissions of the NLC and the TUC with their allies like the Femi Falana- led The Political Alternative Movement, TPAM in the Civil Society, towards repositioning the Labour Party as an \u201calternative platform for rescuing Nigeria ahead of the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nTo boost the consummation of NCFront/Labour Party novel fusion, Ms Bello said leaders of the \u20183rd Force\u2019 Movement across party lines, including Prof Attahiru Jega of the People\u2019s Redemption Party, PRP, Professor Pat Utomi of the Labour Party and Senator Saidu Dansadau of the National Rescue Movement, NRM, among others have been mandated by the leadership of the 3rd Force Movement and allied political parties to drive a Mega Electoral Alliance towards the adoption of a single line of candidates among the seven allied parties involved in the \u20183rd Force\u2019 alliance talks for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe other parties in the coalition are African Democratic Congress, ADC: New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP; Social Democratic Party, SDP; and Allied Peoples Movement, APM.\n\n\u201cWith the novel synergy between the Labour Party and the NCFront, the convening platform of the 3rd Force Movement, which is also today the largest political mass movement in the country, Nigerians can be rest assured that the glorious future we all desire for our dear country, is now achievable by 2023, especially with the brewing implosion hovering over the ruling cartel of APC and PDP, which will soon burst into unpreventable disintegration after their party primaries,\u201dshe said.\n\n\u201cTo this end, an inclusive Consensus Technical Committee to screen presidential candidates and other candidates of \u20183rd Force\u2019 allied Parties towards the adoption of a single line of candidates across all 2023 elections, is expected to be set up next month after the conclusion of all party primaries. Furthermore, the \u20183rd Force\u2019 Mega Electoral Pact for the 2023 elections is proposed around agreement on Labour Charter of Demand, EndSar Youths Demands and Constitutional Referendum for Nigeria, among others to be agreed as terms of the Alliance for the 2023 elections,\u201d she added.\n\nUtomi urges mind shift in readiness for post APC/PDP Nigeria\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman and Leader NCFront, who is shepherding the fusion of the Labour unions, the Labour Party and NCFront, Prof. Pat Utomi, has called for \u201ca shift of mindset in Nigeria to facilitate a new order of good governance, value for money choices and commitment to the dignity of the human person, when the third force fulfils popular aspiration for the end of the current regime of dissatisfactory leadership in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by Kingsley Okoro, the Political Economist urged that all should dirty their hands to prepare for a Third Force government that will focus on the people and not the need and greed of politicians.\n\nHe assured Concerned Professionals on the painstaking efforts to build a strategic alliance for the 2023 elections, beginning with the fusion of NCFront with the Labour Party and build on the fusion an election alliance with other parties which include the ADC, PRP, NNPP, NMR, SDP, APM and several others was bearing fruit.\n\nUtomi, who said he had opened discussions with APGA before recent Supreme Court judgments regarding the party, said there is hope for progress.\n\nThe 2007 and 2011 presidential candidate while paying tribute to the Rescue Nigeria Project Coordinator Dr Usman Bugaje, PRP\u2019s Halilu Bello and Prof. Attahiru Jega, as well as ADC chairman Ralph Okey Nwosu for their untiring work in the construction of the Third Force, said the new Nigeria which beckons from 2023 will profit from lessons drawn from the errors of the last 20 years which resulted in failure to fix the electric power problem and neglect of the need to move orientation away from revenues and revenue sharing to production which has resulted in unprecedented unemployment. This he continued has been feedstock for the current bazaar of violence and insecurity in the country.\n\nProfessor Utomi urged Nigerians to reject the old way which has led to lost glory and favour big idea instead of big men pointing out that to continue to follow a failed approach and hope for a different, preferable outcome is a good definition of insanity.",

          "text": "By Sola Ogundipe\n\nThe Spanish government has approved a draft bill which grants paid \u2018menstrual leave\u2019 for women who suffer from severe period pain. It is the first of such policy to be granted by a European country.\n\nWorkers experiencing period pain will have the right to stay home as long as they need. A doctor consultation will be required to estimate the leave period. The state social security system will pay for the medical leave.\n\nThe legislation is part of a broader reproductive health reform that is set to also include changes to Spain\u2019s abortion laws.\n\nHowever, as with paid leave for other health reasons, a medical doctor must approve the medical incapacity before the leave is granted.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nThe proposed legislation is awaiting approval by parliament, and if passed, Spain will become the first Western country to give women \u2018menstrual leave\u2019. Menstrual leave is offered in a few countries including South Korea, Japan, Zambia and Indonesia.\n\nUnder the reform package passed by Spain\u2019s cabinet, schools will be required to provide sanitary products to girls and there will also be changes to the country\u2019s abortion laws.\n\nIt will end the requirement for girls aged 16 and 17 to obtain parental consent before terminating a pregnancy and include measure to boost access to abortion at private hospitals.\n\nIt also includes paid leave for pregnant women from week 39 and guarantees the distribution of free menstrual products in public institutions such as schools and health centres.\n\nThe draft law also states that surrogate pregnancy, which is illegal in Spain, is a form of violence against women.\n\nIt was not clear whether Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s minority coalition government, which has made women\u2019s rights a priority, has enough support in the assembly to pass the bill.\n\nThe draft bill has provoked a debate in Spain about whether the paid menstrual leave rule will help or hamper women in the workplace.\n\nBut the bottomline is that periods will no longer be taboo.\n\nThe draft bill will go to a public hearing before another reading in the Cabinet and a vote in the lower house of Parliament. Observers have said it won\u2019t be presented for a vote in Parliament before the end of the year.\n\nBesides the length of the process, several politicians and unions of different ideologies have expressed reservations about the bill. But there are fears that the regulation could \u201cstigmatise women\u201d and put them at a disadvantage when competing for jobs.",

Now he has been defeated by corruption. The consensus leadership he recently helped to impose on the party is charging aspirants outrageous sums to contest for tickets and the President failed to call things to order.\n\n\u201cHe owes the likes of Shagari, Awolowo, Bakin Zuwo, Alex Ekwueme an unreserved apology for overthrowing them. The so-called corruption of the Second Republic is nothing compared to what obtains today as evidenced in the unreasonable amount demanded for procuring parties\u2019 nomination forms by aspirants.\u201d\n\nDescribing as outrageous the N100 million nomination fees that Buhari\u2019s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) imposed on presidential aspirants and N50 million for governorship aspirants, OPC said it defeated the essence of regarding public service as service to the people.\n\n\u201cBy these charges, the current generation of politicians have raised the bar of corruption. It shows that they lack plans to revamp the economy and cater to the needs of the common man,\u201d Afolabi said.\n\n\u201cIt shows the level of degeneracy and indecency to which we have sunk as a people. We have totally lost our values.\u201d\n\nRecall that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) fees for President is N40,000,000, governorship N21,000,000, Senate N3,500,000, House of Representatives N2,500,000 and State House of Assembly N600,000.\n\nIn the All Progressives Congress (APC), the fees range from N100 million for presidential aspirants, N50 million for governorship aspirants, N20 million for senatorial aspirants, N10 million for House of Representatives aspirants and N2 million for state House of Assembly aspirants.",

          "text": "SIR: When one tries to look at the tragic-comedy that is apparently playing out in the Southeast, a dispassionate observer would not know whether to laugh or to mourn.\n\nThe otherwise peaceful region has been turned to a killing field by the notorious members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), fuelled and supported by almost all and sundry in the eastern part of the country.\n\nWhile it is so, it is all the more regrettable that otherwise reputed newspapers have unwittingly publicized the activities of the terrorist group, that is, the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in such a manner that is fast becoming repugnant in the minds of the right thinking members of the public.\n\nThis is not supposed to be so. But it is a common fact that The Nation has over time given banner headlines to the activities of IPOB, whether positively or negatively.\n\nThe most recent is the banner photograph in the front page of The Nation newspaper of Thursday May 19, showing the leader of the IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu with his lawyers in the court chamber. For someone who is abreast of the happenings in the east, the photograph cannot be said to be anything less than offensive \u2013 offensive to the eyes and the mind. It would therefore be reasonable, if the reputable newspaper would spare members of the public all that has to do with IPOB and instead publish stories that enhance the overall well-being of the society.\n\nThis is all the more necessary, if one decides to consider the tragic-comical aspect of the happenings the people of the eastern part of Nigeria have foisted on themselves by surreptitiously standing with Nnamdi Kanu in his attempt to turn himself to a hero.\n\nThe living in self-denial by both the traditional and political leaders in the east over Nnamdi Kanu and his IPOB activities can be clearly seen with the recent visit of the governor of Anambra State, Charles Soludo to Nnamdi Kanu in the Department of State Security Services (DSS) cell in Abuja, probably to plead with him to call his boys to order.\n\nNo sooner than Soludo arrive Anambra than the hoodlums set several local government secretariats in the state ablaze and further promised to burn down nine additional secretariats.\n\nRising from that, a lawmaker in the state, Okechukwu Okoye, representing Aguata Constituency in Anambra House of Assembly was on Saturday May 21, murdered in cold blood and his decapitated head deposited in a bag, after shooting his innocent son to death. Faced with this barbaric deed, Charles Soludo has since promised to give N10 million to any person who will volunteer information about the whereabouts of the perpetrators of the heinous crime.\n\nThe simple question remains: who are the people that have been perpetrating such crimes in the entire East? Everyone knows it is the IPOB dissidents, except the traditional and political leaders in the eastern part of Nigeria who apparently have been pretending not to know.\n\nAbout two months ago, the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor\u2019s house was burnt down by the same elements in Imo State. Probably for fear of facing the reality, nobody was bold enough to raise his voice against the happenings, not even the victim was courageous enough to call a spade, spade.\n\nThe ugly trend has therefore continued unabated in the southeast. But the media will do the right-thinking members of the public a great deal of good if they can learn to place the activities of a designated terrorist group where it ought to be, that is, the dustbin.\n\nAffording them a space in a reputable newspaper amounts to emboldening them in their dastardly and heinous crimes.\n\nIfeonu Okolo,\n\nAsaba, Delta State.",

          "text": "By Our Correspondents\n\nThe succession battle between governors and major stakeholders in their states has intensified as the ruling party, All Progressives Congress(APC) and the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) hold their governorship and House of Assembly primaries this week.\n\nWhile that of the PDP will hold on May 25, the APC has rescheduled its governorship primary for May 27.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nPower brokers in the two major parties will this week go for broke as they battle to outwit each other in the selection of their governorship candidates.\n\nIn some states, the sitting governors have anointed their likely successors while in others, the race is still open to all the aspirants. From one state to the other, the battle for succession is raging.\n\nKano: It\u2019s grudge war\n\nBreaking!!! Earn up to N2 - N3 million monthly GUARANTEED (all paid in US Dollars).

Do business with top USA companies like Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Learn more .\n\nThe possible successor in the battle for who succeeds the present Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in 2023 will begin to unravel this week . Excitement, intrigues, betrayal, alignment and even defection among others are some of the highlights of this political frenzy.\n\nUnlike in the past, when the race was essentially a tug of war between the two leading political parties, APC and PDP, the present contest has a new entrant, New Nigerian Peoples Party(NNPP) led by Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and strengthened by the recent defection of Senator Ibrahim Shekarau to its platform.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nBut just like in the past, the 2023 poll would be a continuation of the grudge- war between Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, the two indefatigable giants of modern Kano.\n\nIt is an open secret that both men had sworn to politically undo each other with either of them pledging to retire the other from politics. Even at the best of times and in the bliss of friendship, the two gladiators have subtly battled each other over the control of the state, either by presenting themselves in the ring or by nurturing and nominating their trusted proxies to fight on.\n\nAnalysts believe that what is emerging as the final list for the position of the governor is nothing but the godsons and anointed proxies of the two strongest political forces in the state.\n\nFrom the trenches of the APC is the Nasiru Gawana as the governorship aspirant and Murtala Sule Garo as his running mate. They were unveiled to the members of the party at a recent stakeholders meeting held at the Government House, Kano.\n\nThe two gladiators have a rich political history, especially under the present political dispensation. Gawanu and Garo, it is not forgotten, were prime actors in the famous controversy at Gawuna ward that stalled the elections. This impasse eventually led to the suspension of the process and formed the basis for INECs declaration of the governorship poll in the state as inconclusive.\n\nPrior to his appointment as the State deputy governor, Gawuna had served as a Local Government Chairman under Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, Commissioner for Agriculture under Rabiu Kwankwaso and Commissioner for Agriculture under Abdullahi Umar Ganduje.\n\nOn his part, Garo was a product of the Kwankwaso years as governor of the state. An in- law to Atiku Abubakar and with a lot of grassroots followership, he was the state Commissioner of Local Government and one of the most trusted and able lieutenants of the Ganduje administration.\n\nIn the aftermath of the governor\u2019s anointment, many of the aspirants within the APC had laid down their dreams or had moved on from there.\n\nSome of them, like the former Speaker of the House and current Reps member for Rano and Bukure constituency, Kabiru Alhassan Rirum, elected to defect to the NNPP.\n\nThe likes of Barrister Inuwa Waya remained in the party to struggle on; A.A Zaura stepped down his dream and settled for Kano Central Senate seat while Senator Barau Jilbrin returned to the quest for the senate seat for Kano North.\n\nIn the NNPP, a list of consensus arrangement for various topmost positions appeared in the media a few days ago. From that document, Abba Kabiru Yusuf, a relative of Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, emerged as the flag bearer of the party for the governorship post. Abba, who has stayed away from public light ever since his impressive performance in the 2019 elections, is to be deputized by Aminu Abdulsalam, a former Chief of Staff to Kwankwaso and seasoned politician.\n\nBoth of them, it must be recalled, made history when they emerged as the winner of the first round of the gubernatorial election in the state. They were eventually defeated at the second round of the exercise by the incumbent.\n\nFrom the PDP in the state, the list of aspirants is impressive. They include known faces like multi- millionaire business man, Ibrahim Amin Little, son of former Nigeria Head of State, Mohammad Abacha, son of former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sadiq Wali, former Chief of Staff to Kwankwaso, Dr Abubakar Goni, and the former Chairman of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti Corruption Agency, Buyi Magaji.\n\nOthers are the former Commissioner of Budget in the state, Yusuf Dambatta, Mustapha Bala Getso and a former Commissioner of Work, Mauzu Magaji as well as Jafar Sani Bello. Bello told Daily Sun by phone that he is very optimistic he would pick the ticket of the party, adding he and his team had worked very hard to emerge victorious.\n\nDaily Sun reports that a number of litigations between the current State Executive led by Shehu Shagagi and the Aminu Wali faction of the party have shrouded the activities of the party, reducing its impact as an alternate political party in the state.\n\nBut there is hope that as soon as they are done with their litigations, the party would rise up to its challenges and be counted.\n\nFrom the Peoples Redemption Party is the son of Tanko Yakasai, Salihu Tanko Yakassai. He was removed from office for siding the Nigeria masses against Buhari, and has remained very popular.\n\nEnugu: The mind game\n\nNo fewer than 20 persons are jostling to replace Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State by May 29, next year, in the three major political parties of PDP, APC and APGA.\n\nSixteen of this number are from the PDP and they include, former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, Prof Bart Nnaji, Chijioke Edeoga, Peter Mbah, Senator Gil Nnaji, Capt. Evarest Nnaji, Rev. Ifeanyi Nwoye, Chinyeaka Ohaa, and Dr. Gabriel Ajah.\n\nOthers are Dr. Kingsley Udeh, Pastor Beloved-Dan Anike, Nwabueze Ugwu, Dr Josef Onoh, Erasmus Anike, Prof. Jehu Nnaji and Chukwudi Nneji.\n\nIn APGA are former Minister of Information, Frank Nweke (Jnr.), Jeff Nnamani and Donatus Uzoemena, while the APC has Chief Uche Nnaji as the only visible aspirant.\n\nThree major factors would determine who succeeds Ugwuanyi at the end of the day; namely: influence of zoning principle; how the Isi-Uzo matter is handled and the eventual fate of the clamour for South East Presidency.\n\nBarring any changes in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) timetable, all these issues must be settled in less than 10 days.\n\nThere have been campaigns that there is governorship zoning arrangement in the state and that it is the turn of Enugu East Senatorial District. Interest groups have invested substantially in pushing this agenda including hosting campaigns. Yet, within this group also exist those who lobby that there should be micro zoning to either Nkanu East or Isi-Uzo Local Government Area citing backwardness in the case of the former.\n\nBut another formidable group led by the senator representing Enugu West, Ekweremadu insists that the governorship slot having gone round the three zones should now be open for grabs. For them, what matters most at this period is competency; the capacity of the aspirant to deliver.\n\nIn the midst of all these, there has also been contention over the three-man delegates list of the party. Both camps have instituted law suits regarding what the authentic delegates\u2019 list should be. This has further opened flanks for squabbles within the party.\n\nGovernor Ugwuanyi has not spoken publicly on where he stands on the unfolding scenarios including naming his preferred aspirant. His has been a clear case of \u2018hide and seek,\u2019 though it is open secret that he totally supports zoning the slot to Enugu East. He attended different rallies to shore up support for zoning the governorship there.\n\nAs it stands, virtually all the aspirants are jostling to get the governor\u2019s endorsement. But, the popular thinking in Enugu is that the immediate past Commissioner for Environment, Chijioke Edeoga, who hails from Isi-Uzo has the backing of the governor.\n\nEdeoga, a former member of the House of Representatives has continued to power in a manner that not a few see him as the anointed one. The only snag for him is that people are seeing him as an extension of Nsukka cultural bloc where Ugwuanyi belongs.\n\nThe fear is that the core Nkanu people in Enugu East Senatorial District may work against him in the election proper if he eventually grabs the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nIn that situation, they may support any of their own that emerges from either APGA or APC. There is also the feeling that Ekweremadu may toe the same path in the event that he is denied the PDP ticket.\n\nThe foregoing scenario has further compounded PDP\u2019s headache in Enugu State.\n\nAnother important factor is that the outcomes of the PDP and APC Presidential conventions relating to the South East would determine the direction of the governorship race in the zone. So, voters in the zone will naturally vote for any party that gives presidential ticket to somebody from the region, and Enugu would not be different.\n\nMeanwhile, 15 PDP governorship aspirants from Enugu East Senatorial District, Saturday, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accept, without hesitation, any one among them whom the governor chooses to become the candidate of the party.\n\nIt was only Prof. Hillary Edeoga that failed to produce himself for the meeting where the undertaking was entered into before the Enugu East Traditional Rulers Council led by its Chairman, Igwe Julius Nnaji, the Odezuluigbo II of Nike.\n\nIn the MoU, the aspirants also agreed not to drag the fallout of Ugwuanyi\u2019s choice and the primary election to any court of law, agreeing also, that those not favoured by the choice would be carried along in the new government to be formed in 2023.\n\nThey said they were committed to \u201cA compromise on matters that will promote unity, law, and order during the campaign and election period; respect for the governor of Enugu State and acceptance of his choice of a candidate from this group in the best interests of the Enugu\u2013East Senatorial Zone and Enugu State at large.\n\nThe MoU was prepared under the auspices, guidance, and direction of the Traditional Rulers Council of the Enugu\u2013East Senatorial District and the PDP Zonal Chairman, Enugu-East Senatorial District, Chief Nnamdi Nwafor and adopted at the Nike Lake Resort Hotel in Enugu.\n\nTaraba: Religion and zoning as major factors\n\nIn Taraba, several intrigues and permutations have continued to play out in the hustle for the governorship seat with alleged outright imposition of candidates and substitution of delegate list in some political parties.\n\nApart from that, religion and zoning remain some of the topical issues that would decide the fate of the aspirants.\n\nThe PDP has enjoyed uninterrupted rule of Taraba since the return to democracy in 1999, producing all the governors so far and most of the legislative positions both at the state and federal levels.\n\nDuring the 2015 and 2019 general elections, the candidate of the APC gave a hard run to the party but the party still held sway ultimately. This was partly due to the high regards they had for the zoning arrangement that saw the first governor from the Northern Zone between 1999 and 2003, Central Zone between 2007 and 2015 and Southern Taraba from 2015 to date.\n\nHowever, as the preparations for the 2023 general elections gather momentum, the party seems to be in disarray as the zoning arrangement seems to have been relegated to the background.\n\nFollowing the zoning arrangement, the governorship position is supposed to return to the Northern Zone in 2023. However, while the governor is said to be in full support of the arrangement, some interests in the South have insisted that the seat must remain in the zone for the next eight years.\n\nAccording to Alhaji Abdulrazaq Musa, the pioneer Chairman of PDP in the state who is also the leader of PDP elders forum from Northern Zone, the move by some interests to set aside the zoning arrangement could spell doom for the party.\n\nHowever, only recently, an elder statesman was alleged to have stirred the anger of the party members in his bid to impose a candidate from the Southern Zone who is very unpopular in the state.\n\nWhile about five aspirants from the Northern Zone have picked the forms and have been screened by the party, two other aspirants front the South have also been screened and cleared to contest.\n\nAmong the top aspirants in the northern zone are the Speaker of the state Assembly, Professor Joseph Albasu Kunini, former PDP Chairman in the state, Victor Bala Kona, former Accountant General of the state, Ayuba Aminu Kotolo, Dr Hilkia Buba Joda and Professor Jerome Nyame. In the South, Mr Damian Dodo (SAN) and Senator Joel Ikyenya also picked the forms and have been cleared to vie for the ticket of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC in the state is also relentless in her bid to take over the state in 2023.\n\nThe state Chairman of the party Alhaji Ibrahim Tukur El-Sudi told Journalists recently that the ruling PDP in the state has done all the campaign for the APC through the gross underperformance of the present administration in the state and expressed optimism that the party will win the state unfailingly in 2023.\n\nThe party has also enjoyed influx of high profile persons from the PDP recently including the former Senate Deputy Minority leader, Emmanuel Bwacha, former speakers of the state House of Assembly, Mr Abel Diah and Dr. Mark Useni among others.\n\nHowever, a clash of interests among the old and new comers is threatening to tear the party apart. Only recently, the party Chairman announced and inaugurated a new set of officials for four local government areas in the Southern zone of the state in a move many believe was intended to alter the political calculations in favour of a certain new comer and aspirant in the party. So far, the move is met with still opposition and litigations.\n\nWhile the party maintains that the zoning arrangement is a creation of the PDP and has nothing to do with the APC, most people believe that religion will okay a central role in deciding the fate of the party.\n\nIn the two governorship elections that the party has participated in so far in the state, most people believe that the party failed to make headways because they fielded candidates who are Muslims, giving credence to the notion that the APC is a religious or Muslim party.\n\nFor most analysts, \u201cthe APC stands a very good chance of clinching the governorship seat of the state if they are fair enough to allow a Christian fly their flag, rather than insisting on a Muslim\u201d.\n\nTaraba is a predominantly Christian state with a good Muslim population. In recent times, however, the Muslim Council raised the alarm over what they considered as marginalisation of Muslims in the state by the state government.\n\nMeanwhile, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the NNPP, and other political parties are also on standby, deliberately delaying their primaries to create room for those who may feel aggrieved with the outcome of their respective party primaries and may decide to defect to other options.\n\nWhile the issues of zoning, religion, litigations and imposition of candidates continue to play strategic roles in the clamour for who succeeds Governor Darius Ishaku in 2023, insecurity and poverty are a major concern for the people.\n\nRecent security challenges in the state occasioned by bomb blasts, rise in thuggery and street violence especially at political gatherings are a major cause for alarm for the people.\n\nWhether the political parties and political bigwigs will be willing to play the game by the rules, allow delegates to chose the right candidates and rally support for whoever emerges for each party, or whether the process of primaries will lead to the crash of some political parties and the rise of others remains to be seen in the days ahead. For now, one thing that is obvious is that the political calculations in Taraba as regards the governorship tussle remain a mirage.\n\nCross River: Consensus collapses\n\nIn Cross River, the consensus option initially envisaged has collapsed as the APC, PDP governorship aspirants head for primaries.\n\nA few days away from the exercise, the two major parties in the state are working round the clock to manoeuvre the political space for the governorship victory in 2023.\n\nBefore now, the discordant tunes over zoning and consensus were the trending campaign issues but all that seem to have collapsed ahead of the governorship primaries.\n\nThe APC in the state took the bull by the horns on May 10, 2022 when it announced Sen. Bassey Otu as the consensus governorship aspirant. Sen Ot\u00f9, seen by many party stalwarts as a game changer, was a former Senator representing southern senatorial district of Cross River state.\n\nBut describing the consensus as contrived and taken \u2018amid good food and vintage liquor\u2019, the Director-General of Chris Agara Campaign Organisation, Richard Ogbeche, in a statement dissociated them from the arrangement, saying \u201cwe are not part of the so-called \u2018consensus\u2019 APC candidature.\u201d\n\nThe statement said as legitimate members of the APC, they have always respected and will continue to respect the lawful decisions of the party and all its organs at all levels, but added that such respect and loyalty should however be mutual since the leadership of the party and the governor are as important to the members as the members should be important to them.\n\nAgara pointed out the grave disrespect to some governorship aspirants and assured its teeming supporters that he remains committed and competitive in the race and is prepared to pursue his aspiration to its logical conclusion.\n\nThe emergence of the Chancellor and owner of Arthur Jarvis University, Sir Arthur Jarvis Archibong, as the PDP Southern Senatorial Elders Forum consensus aspirant ahead of the party\u2019s governorship primary has not only unsettled some aspirants, but thrown the party in the zone into confusion.\n\nJarvis who polled the majority votes during the Southern Senatorial district PDP leaders\u2019 meeting, was named the unanimous choice of the Southern Senatorial district against other aspirants including Senator Gershom Bassey, Daniel Asuquo, Efiok Cobham, Amb. Nkoyo Toyo and Pastor Eyo Okpoene.\n\nThe meeting held on May 8, 2022 and presided over by the former Governor Donald Duke was aimed at encouraging the aspirants to, on their own accord, whittle down their numbers and thus enhance the chances for the success of a Southern candidate for the party.\n\nDuke in a statement explained that the inability of all the aspirants to present one aspirant led to the decision of the elders in the house to decide on a non-binding straw poll that would reflect the acceptability of the aspirants.\n\nNo doubt, the motive behind the moves for consensus was to see the possibility of both APC and PDP in the state coasting easily for a no contest and then affirming their candidates on the D-Day. But it is clear that the consensus arrangement is in the balance.\n\nAs it stands, both parties are working on a tightrope as it is certain that all the aspirants who have been cleared are going into contest.\n\nAbia: Crisis of succession boiling over\n\nTwenty four years since it has been in the saddle, the PDP in Abia State has never had the kind of crisis it is going through now. Analysts argue that the crisis is such that if nothing is urgently done, the party may not come out of it without serious bruises.\n\nAt the center of the problem is the race for 2023; which zone in the state will produce Governor Okezie Ikpeazu\u2019s successor. While Abia North Senatorial District insist that power must return to the zone where it started in 1999, the Ngwa axis which is presently holding on to power, are insisting a segment of it (Umunneato) in Abia Central would produce the next governor.\n\nThe leadership of the party in the state has not helped matters when it zoned the governorship ticket to both Abia North and Abia Central at the same time. With this arrangement, the Ngwa in Abia Central, have been accommodated in the race.\n\nThis strange zoning arrangement, created some controversies. Critical stakeholders of PDP in Abia, including former Senate President, Adolph Wabara, former governor of Abia State, Senator Theodore Orji; former NDDC, Chairman, Chief Onyema Ugochukwu, former SSG, Dr. Eme Okoro, amongst others who had earlier insisted that power must shift back to Abia North, condemned the zoning arrangement, warning of its inherent consequences for the party.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that Ikpeazu was comfortable with the zoning arrangement since it was later discovered the person he was said to have anointed to succeed him, Prof Uche Ikonne is from the Abia Central Senatorial District.\n\nIkpeazu, pitching himself against the major stakeholders of the party, most of who were instrumental to his becoming governor, and the other governorship aspirants, including his deputy, Ude Oko Chukwu; the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abiribe, Ncheta Omerekpe, Nnanna Nwafor, Senator Emma Nwaka, Chima Anyaso and others, the battle line was drawn. The battle of who controls the 3-man delegates that would vote for Ikpeazu\u2019s successor has reached its peak and would be decided this week.\n\nThere are some controversies over the election of the 3-man delegates. Governor Ikpeazu was reported to have been seen in a video, addressing some party members at Obingwa Ward 7 claiming that delegates had been elected.\n\nWhile the State Working Committee (SWC) of the party, appeared to have concurred with the governor over the 3-man delegates election, some stakeholders of the party, and all the other governorship aspirants, except Prof Ikonne insisted there was no 3-man delegates election held in the state.\n\nThe aspirants last week, took their matter to the national leadership of the party in Abuja.\n\nLed by Abaribe, the aspirants who appealed to the party\u2019s NWC to do away with any list submitted by Abia SWC as 3-man delegates list and conduct the Abia governorship primaries with the statutory delegates, warned of the legal consequences of doing otherwise.\n\nThe state secretary of PDP, David Iro said in a statement, there was no delegates election held anywhere in the state and this earned him one month suspension.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has said Abia PDP was yet to conduct its ad-hoc delegate election.\n\nINEC\u2019s position was made known via a letter by its Secretary, Rose Oriaran-Anthony in response to an enquiry made by a legal practitioner.\n\nHowever, as the battle over the 3-ad hoc list rages, one Mr. Akuoma Friday on May 17, 2022 went to court and obtained an Exparte Order making it mandatory for the controversial three-man adhoc delegates as the only electors at the primaries in Abia State.\n\nThe court presided over by Justice C.U Okoroafor, adjourned till May 25, 2022, the day of the governorship primary, for hearing on the matter.\n\nBy the order, it means statutory delegates in Abia State have been barred from participating in the primaries.\n\nSome stakeholders of the party have in the light of the above, appealed to the national leadership of the party to reschedule the primaries in Abia to allow for the vacation of the court order, to avoid Abia from going the way of Zamfara after the 2019 elections wherein the state was disqualified from having participated in the election.\n\nWhatever happens, this week, Governor Ikpeazu\u2019s successor will be known.\n\nEbonyi: Battle reaches crescendo\n\nThe battle over who succeeds Governor David Umahi in 2023 has reached a crescendo with senatorial zones, clans and major political actors at each other\u2019s jugular.\n\nAspirants under the ruling APC are the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Francis Nwifuru; immediate past Chairman of Revenue Mobilization Allocation And Fiscal Commission, Elias Mbam; Labour party candidate in the 2015 general elections, Edward Nkwegu (all from the North), and former Senator Julius Ali UchA (from the central).\n\nBut Governor Umahi who hails from the Southern part of the state has already anointed the Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Mr. Francis Nwifuru, as his choice of successor.\n\nNwifuru who hails from Izzi clan in the Northern Senatorial District of the state was among the 16 lawmakers who defected from the PDP to the APC in solidarity with Governor Umahi when he defected to APC in the year 2020.\n\nUmahi openly endorsed the lawmaker in April during a burial ceremony in Okposi, Ohaozara local government area of the state.\n\nHowever, the endorsement of Nwifuru by the governor did not go down well with other aspirants and some critical political actors especially the founding members of the APC in the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe first to reject the endorsement was the former Ebonyi Central Senator and pioneer Speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly,Mr. Julius Ucha, who is also a governoship aspirant on the platform of the APC.\n\nUcha who was a member of the Action Congress of Nigeria(ACN) that merged to form the APC in 2013, described the Speaker\u2019s endorsement as undemocratic and unacceptable.\n\nHe pointedly told Governor Umahi that the endorsement of the Speaker will fail.\n\nUcha who hails from the majority Ezza clan in the central senatorial district vowed to contest the election.\n\nThe former Ebonyi Central Senator who had emerged a consensus APC govership aspirant for Ezza clan advised Governor Umahi to quickly rescind the endorsement to give all aspirants a level playing ground.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abakaliki, Ucha who was the candidate of the party in 2015 general elections, warned that any attempt to circumvent democratic process in the party\u2019s primary election will be vehemently rejected.\n\nWhile the dust raised by Ucha\u2019s press conference was yet to settle, a faction of the party in the state that operated under the aegis of Old APC stakeholders led by a factional Chairman of the party in the state, Harou Ajah, petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Chairman of APC, Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nIn the petition which was also published in some national dailies, the Old APC members alleged that the Speaker of the assembly endorsed by the governor was not a member of the party.\n\nAjah claimed that Nwifuru and 15 other lawmakers sacked by the Federal High Court Abuja over their alleged defection to APC had sworn affidavit and presented to the Appeal Court that they never defected to APC and asked the appellate court to reverse their sack.\n\nInterestingly, intra-party wrangling ahead of the primary elections is also heating up the PDP in the state.\n\nPolitical interests and sectional sentiments have also caused serious disaffections among major political players in the opposition PDP.\n\nBut the real bone of contention in the PDP is the struggle among the three senatorial zones over which zone should take the gubernatorial ticket ahead of the general elections.\n\nSome argue that since the governorship has rotated peacefully among the three Senatorial zones, the ticket should return to Ebonyi North where it started in 1999.\n\nFirst civilian Governor of the state and Senator representing Ebonyi North in the National Assembly, Dr. Sam Egwu belongs to this school of thought.\n\nBut the Ezza people in the central senatorial district have vehemently rejected the idea arguing that being the eldest clan, and given the pivotal roles played by their sons during the struggle for the creation of the state, they should be given the opportunity to produce the governor of the state in 2023.\n\nRivers: Battle of old rivals\n\nThe situation is not going to be much different in Rivers, the oil-rich state.\n\nIn Rivers, the governor, Nyesom Wike, is a strong politician to reckon with. He has his unique style of playing politics and it works for him.\n\nAnalysts see him as a rugged politician, who uses that approach to bulldoze his way to victory.\n\nHowever, the game is not likely to be an easy one as he will once again confront his arch opponent and current minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi who is the leader of the APC in the state.\n\nSome argue that with the irreconcilable internal crisis between the Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe factions, the Wike-led PDP would take advantage of the crisis to victory. The crisis in APC, which has lingered for seven years is not likely to end now as none of the factions is willing to sheathe its sword.\n\nHowever, critical observers are also not sure how the ruling PDP will settle its own brewing crisis owing to the number of aspirants who want to succeed Governor Wike.\n\nThe aspirants include the former PDP chairman in the state, Felix Obuah, former Secretary to the State Government, Tammy Danagogo, Senator George Sekibo, former Deputy Governor, Tele Ikuru, Senator Lee Maeba, former Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Austin Opara, Isaac Kamalu and Mr. Sim Harry.\n\nThere is a strong rumour that the governor may either favour Kamalu or Harry but the snag is that they are believed by Rivers people, to be politically unpopular even though both of them held sensitive appointments in Wike\u2019s administration.\n\nAlso, there are speculations that the governor might decide to allow the Rivers South-East senatorial district to produce his successor to settle the Ogoni ethnic nationality whose people have decried decades of political marginalization in the state.\n\nSo, as it is, nobody can authoritatively predict who succeeds Governor Wike in 2023 but the flag bearers of the two major parties will likely be known this week.\n\nBenue: It\u2019s Ortom Versus Akume\n\nIn Benue, the battle is between the PDP, the ruling party in the state and the main opposition party, APC. For those who know the state, it is going to be a tough battle in view of the fact that the incumbent, Samuel Ortom of the PDP will be facing the APC led by a former governor of the state and Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the PDP being in power is the party to beat in the state.\n\nAs at the last count in the PDP, it was gathered that 14 governorship aspirants had bought forms, submitted and have been screened and ready to participate in the primaries.\n\nIt would be recalled that the party, after serious deliberation with stakeholders from the three Senatorial districts of the state, had adopted the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Titus Uba as consensus aspirant for the 14 Tiv Speaking Local Government Areas and the Deputy Governor, Benson Abounu as consensus aspirant for the 9 Idoma and Igede speaking LGAs.\n\nAlthough, the party tried to adopt a consensus, 12 out of the over 30 aspirants who earlier indicated interest to contest the election refused the consensus arrangement and went ahead to purchase nomination forms.\n\nBut after series of meetings and consultations with the 12 aspirants who had purchased their forms, eight of them from the Tiv speaking area agreed to toe the party\u2019s decision to adopt Uba as their aspirant.\n\nThe aspirants made their stance known on Friday, May 20th, 2023 after a meeting with Governor Samuel Ortom and Senator Gabriel Suswam at the Government House in Makurdi to finalise their consultations ahead of the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nThe aspirants who gave their nod to the aspiration of Uba include, Barr. Chille lgbawua, Arc. Joe Ikyaagba, Dr Jibo, Mrs. Susan Waya, Dr. Paul Ubwa, Dr. Paul Orhii, Dr. Akumbur and Dr. Dominic Akaahan.\n\nAlso, in a chat with newsmen shortly after the meeting, Igbauwa who is Chairman of the Forum of PDP Governorship aspirants in the state, disclosed that eight out of the 12 of them that purchased their nomination forms have agreed to work together to ensure that the consensus candidate of the party is returned at the forthcoming primary election without rancour.\n\nHe said they were committed to following all the processes prescribed by law and ensuring that due process was followed in support of Uba so that at the end of the day, their agreement would be lawful.\n\nIgbawua who was flanked by Governor Ortom, Senator Suswam and the other aspirants also said their meeting was to consolidate their decision and resolutions when 10 of them met Thursday, May 19th, 2022 on the matter.\n\nSo, as it stands now, and barring any last minute change, six gubernatorial aspirants on the platform of the PDP will be slugging it out at the Party\u2019s primaries billed to hold this week.\n\nThe aspirants who will be going into the PDP primaries include, Titus Uba, Benson Abounu, Dennis Ityavyar, Ben Akaakar, Paul Angya and Terkaa Ucha.\n\nBut in the APC, out of the 32 aspirants who indicated interests to contest the number one seat, only 12 have purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nOf the number, it was gathered that 10 were favoured by the zoning arrangements of the party while two others who were zoned out of the contest went ahead to get the ruling party\u2019s nomination forms.\n\nThe party had zoned the governorship seat to the Jechira intermediate area of Zone \u201cA\u201d comprising Vandeikya and Konshisha Local government areas as well as aspirants from the Benue South Senatorial District known as Zone \u201cC.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s Publicity Secretary, Dan-Morgan Ihomun, in an interview told Daily Sun that with the new zoning arrangement, only two aspirants who had bought the nomination forms for the governorship seat were not favoured.\n\nAccording to Ihomun, the names of those aspirants zoned out of the contest who bought nomination forms include former Attorney General of the Federation, Mike Kaase Aondoakaa as well as immediate past Chief of Staff to Governor Samuel Ortom, Pastor Terwase Orbunde.\n\nAsked what becomes of those who had bought the nomination forms but were not favoured by the zoning arrangement, the Publicity Secretary said the party will not stop them from participating in the primaries in any way.\n\n\u201cThe issue is very simple for those from the local governments that are zoned out of the contest but went ahead to buy forms. As you know, the zoning and consensus has to be accepted by all the candidates themselves and in the event that they do not accept the decision of the party, of course they are free to go into the election. If they win fine, it is as simple as that.\n\n\u201cSo, as it is, only Aondoakaa and Orbunde are out of the zoning arrangements,\u201d Ihomun added.\n\nThe Party\u2019s publicity scribe also disclosed that the leader of the party in the state and Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, as a party man and law abiding citizen of the country, would not interfere in the selection process of who emerges as the party\u2019s flag bearer during the primaries.\n\nAkwa Ibom: Not yet Uhuru for Uno\n\nThe succession train in Akwa Ibom has not derailed from its usual high-tension manipulations, accusations, intrigues, disappointments, rancour, squander-mania and bandwagon effect. It has always been so since 1999.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s attempt to wrap up the issue of who succeeds him by anointing Mr.Umo Eno, his erstwhile commissioner for lands and water resources, ran into seeming serious troubled waters with avalanche of condemnations, criticisms, zoning jingoism, hues and cries, threats and blackmail.\n\nThe governor, who seemed unperturbed up to the point of ignoring the rancour at home to pick the PDP presidential nomination form, appears to have weathered the storm, especially if the party would deploy the ad-hoc delegates in the primaries as those who mounted stiff opposition and appeared to have boxed the governor and his successor-apparent into a corner, could be deflated at the primaries.\n\nSo other things being equal, Umo Eno is coasting home to PDP nomination victory leaving Onofiok Luke and Sen Bassey Albert to decide who comes second and third while rest of the pack only as former aspirants. This is because the state government is in total control of nearly 4000 adhoc delegates and some sizable number of statutory delegates.\n\nThe realisation of impending failure has caused some aspirants to defect to the main opposition party, APC, which however is embroiled in its characteristic factional squabbles with two state chairmen and some state executive Council members.\n\nSuch defectors include Mr Akan Udofia, said to have bought forms in both political parties, but recently declared for APC.\n\nAnalysts believe that unless Sen Godswill Akpabio gets the presidential ticket to boost the moral of APC, the party may soon sing its nunc dimittis in the state; and the impending governorship feud between Senators John Akpanudoedehe and Ita Enang, could even make its case worse.\n\nPlateau: Immersed in cloud of uncertainty\n\nIn Plateau State, a cloud of political uncertainty is hovering round the APC and PDP as delegates prepare to select candidates who will fly the tickets of the two parties in 2023.\n\nNine governorship aspirants purchased the nomination forms of APC and have been cleared by the party to contest the party primaries billed for Thursday May 27, 2022 while 18 aspirants purchased the PDP nomination forms and have also been cleared to contest the primaries scheduled for Wednesday, May 25, 2023.\n\nThe number appears very high in the PDP due to the cost of nomination forms compared to the APC where about 20 persons had earlier indicated interest in the governorship but only nine afforded the N50 million to pick the form.\n\nPolitical pundits believe that the opposition PDP has greater number of aspirants based on the fact that PDP is grounded in the state and has high chances of producing Lalong\u2019s successor if the mistake of 2015 is not repeated.\n\nAll aspirants in each political parties are working round the clock, clinging on political bigwigs in the state to outsmart one another with a view to clinch the ticket of their respective parties.\n\nAcross the two major political parties, the voting pattern would be based on the existing political blocs in the respective parties. In the APC, the contest is between the Governor Simon Lalong bloc, Sen. Joshua Dariye bloc and those who are scrambling for relevance.\n\nFor PDP, the political relevance and influence of former Governor Jonah David Jang would determine who picks the ticket as all the aspirants are holding tight to their political ideology to gain sympathy of the delegates.\n\nLiterally, the two major parties have zoned the governorship seat to Plateau Central where virtually all the aspirants hail from with the exception of few who came out from different Senatorial zones.\n\nNames that are popping up, likely to fly the ticket of the APC includes Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda, former Resident Electoral Commission, INEC, Benue State, Dr. Patrick Dakum, Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria (IHVN), Prof. Sonni Tyoden, Deputy Governor of Plateau State, Mr. Sunday Biggs, Former Permanent Secretary, Plateau State Government and Nde David Victor Dimka, former Comptroller of Nigeria Custom Service among others.\n\nIt is rumoured that Governor Simon Lalong has issued directive to the party, local government chairmen and all his appointees to deliver Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda, a development that has heated politicking in the ruling APC.\n\nSimilarly, the strongest contenders in the PDP includes Caleb Mutfwang, a technocrat and former Executive Chairman of Mangu Local Government Area, Timothy Golu, former member, House of Representatives, Prof. Shedrack Best, former Secretary to Plateau State Government, Amb. Bagudu Hirse, former Nigeria Ambassador and former Minister of Forieign Affairs and Mr. Dauda Gotring, a former Banker and former Staff of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nAn ardent supporter of the PDP would consider the factors crucial because of the allegations of anti-party by some PDP members during the 2015 election that led power out of the party.\n\nIn the APC, it is alleged that Governor Lalong has pitched tent with Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda due to the crucible role he allegedly played as INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner of Benue State in returning Lalong in 2019 against all odds.\n\nThe rumour has unsettled other aspirants who believe that they are credible, competent and spent huge resources to nurture and sustain the party since inception in 2014.\n\nThe aggrieved aspirants had in a press conference in Jos endorsed by 18 aspirants including those who couldn\u2019t afford the nomination forms asked the governor to revert his decision of contemplating dumping the party for another.\n\nBut the state APC chairman, Rufus Bature cleared the air that the party has no preferred candidate for the primaries and said a level playing ground would be provided for all aspirants to contest for the party ticket.\n\nHe noted that the party is working round the clock to consolidate on the victory of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nKaduna: It\u2019s battle royale\n\nToday, what is uppermost in the minds of the people of Kaduna State is who takes over from the incumbent governor, Nasir El-rufai in 2023.\n\nInterestingly, a good number of politicians from other political parties, particularly the APC) and PDP have declared their intentions and picked forms for the number one seat of the state.\n\nBut feelers from within and outside the state have indicated that the interest shown by politicians especially amongst the allies of the incumbent governor is an indication that the primaries in the APC will be more fierce than the El-rufai\u2019s 2015 and 2019 primaries contest.\n\nHowever, recent development has shown that top echelons of the ruling APC are doing everything possible to enforce consensus candidate at the primaries.\n\nHowever, one of the APC contenders Sani Sha\u2019aban has faulted the process of selecting delegates by the party in Kaduna and has since written a petition to challenge it.\n\nThe congresses were done by consensus by APC\u2019s elections guidelines and constitution in the 23 Local Government Areas of Kaduna State last weekend.\n\nBut, the Appeals Committee for the Ad-hoc Delegate Congresses of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State, has upheld the Congress, describing the exercise as successful.\n\nMeanwhile, the leading opposition party in the state, the PDP held a consensus building meeting. The meeting was said to be a signal to the ruling party that PDP is now ready to take over power in the coming elections.\n\nIn PDP, the 2019 Gubernatorial Candidate in Kaduna, Isa Ashiru appears to be the most favoured aspirant. In the 2019 election, Ashiru came second, while Governor El-rufai was declared the winner of the election.\n\nOyo: Intrigues and horse trading at its best\n\nBarring last minute changes, the 2023 gubernatorial poll in Oyo State will be a straight contest between the PDP and the APC.\n\nFrom all indications, the incumbent governor, Seyi Makinde of PDP will emerge as the party\u2019s candidate. Though a former deputy governor of the state, Hazeem Gbolarumi, has also indicated interest to contest the governorship poll on the platform of PDP, political pundits have observed that he has no chance against Governor Makinde.\n\nIn the APC, there are many gladiators jostling to get the party\u2019s gubernatorial ticket. They include a former deputy governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Chief Adebayo Adelabu, who was the party\u2019s governorship candidate in 2019; the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Content, Teslim Folarin, who was the Senate Leader between 2007 and 2011; former chairman, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Akeem Agbaje; a cardiovascular surgeon and former Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Azeez Adeduntan; and an engineer, Alao Oyedele.\n\nA legal luminary, Chief Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), has also shown interest in getting the governorship ticket of APC. The Chairman, National Communication Commission (NCC), Prof Adeolu Akande, is also among the governorship aspirants on the APC platform.\n\nInvestigation carried out by Daily Sun\u2019s reporter revealed that the contest for the governorship ticket of APC is really between Adebayo Adelabu, and Teslim Folarin. Further investigation has also shown that Adelabu may be the favoured aspirant that will eventually emerge as the APC governorship candidate.\n\nFederal lawmakers, who are privy to the disposition of some powers that be in Abuja, have, however, made it known that discussion is on for Adelabu to get the party\u2019s governorship ticket, while Folarin should return to the Senate from Oyo Central senatorial district. The caveat is that Adelabu must return partially the money spent so far by Folarin in pursuing his gubernatorial ambition. But the final decision has not been taken ahead of the governorship primary of APC that will be held on Thursday, this week.\n\nIt was further revealed that Adelabu is being favoured because he was the 2019 governorship candidate of the APC , when he garnered over 350,000 votes and came second after Seyi Makinde of PDP that won the poll.\n\nThen, another factor that is working in favour of Adelabu is the fact that he bought scores of Sienna cars that were used for campaign in 2019. After he lost the poll, he did not ask the beneficiaries to return them. The people have been using the cars since then.\n\nMeanwhile, the way things are now, Governor Seyi Makinde and Adebayo Adelabu, will emerge as PDP and APC governorship candidates respectively. The candidates of other political parties may either contest against the duo, or form alliances, either with PDP, or APC.\n\nChecks also showed that developments within the PDP and APC have made it very difficult for political analysts to say with certainty, who will emerge as the state governor in 2023. The internal wranglings within the PDP and APC have made the governorship poll very dicey.\n\nAt present, the governorship aspirants across the political parties are scrambling for the soul of delegates, and favour of political leadership to emerge as candidates.\n\nNasarawa: Gov Sule versus three PDP gladiators\n\nIn Nasarawa, the political atmosphere is charged. Governor Abdullahi Sule of APC is eligible to run for re-election, and had made his intention known to the Nasarawa people when supporters of the governor under the aegis of Abdullahi Sule Amalgamated Support Groups, led by one Murtala Abubakar-Muhammad, had purchased the N50 million expression of interest and nomination forms, aimed at compelling the governor to seek reelection.\n\nDeclaring his intention to run for a second term in office in Lafia, Sule said he was re-contesting the governorship seat in 2023 to justify the efforts of his supporters who had contributed their funds to purchase the forms for him.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome of these people who are barely making a living came together and raised the funds to buy the nomination and expression of interest forms for me to re-contest for the 2023 governorship election.\n\n\u201cThis gesture is very touchy and important to me, so I cannot turn down their request. Therefore, I hereby declare to re-contest as governor in the 2023 election.\n\nBut a twist unfolded as the former wife of the present National Chairman of the APC, Hakiyat Fatima Hussain Abdullahi picked the expression of Interest and Nomination form to contest for the governorship position in Nasarawa State.\n\nPicking the form at the party Secretariat through the national organising secretary, Suleiman Muhammad Argungu, she said the quest to contest is to alleviate poverty from the people of the state and to ensure equal representation of women in politics.\n\nWith the development, it is therefore important to note that Hajia Fatima is aspiring to contest in the party primaries against the incumbent governor, Abdullahi Sule, who has declared his intention to contest for the second term last week.\n\nWhen Daily Sun contacted stakeholders in APC, none agreed to comment on the issue in other to avoid taking sides between the different camps emerging in the state.\n\nBut for Sule to get his second term bid, he must contend with three gladiators of the PDP who have come together towards ensuring taking power off the ruling APC.\n\nAll the three aspirants of the PDP in Nasarawa pledged to accept the outcome of the forthcoming primaries in good faith.",

          "text": "Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Charles Soludo, has pledged N10 million to anyone who provides useful information that will lead to the arrest of the killers of the state House of Assembly and his aide.\n\n\n\nThe Governor said, having been in public office over the years with impeccable achievements, Amaechi would deploy his wealth of experience to piloting the affairs of the country to greater heights.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of delegates with the frontline Presidential aspirant, Chibuike Amaechi at the Government House, Gombe, Weekend, Governor Yahaya said, \u201cGoing by the trajectory on which your life is built, from Speaker to Governor and to Minister, and if you get to that level that you are aspiring to get to, that means everything is settled.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have shown capacity, you\u2019ve shown energy and passion and you have shown the capacity to deliver on any assignment or political mandate that is given to you. Our delegates, knowing how you handled the previous assignments given to you and the capacity that you have proven to have, will give them the cause and confidence to go with you, because we know with you, everything is settled.\n\n\n\n\u201cGombe is your second home. You stood to fight and bring in Mr. President, and by so doing you\u2019ve shown commitment, you\u2019ve shown capacity.\n\n\n\n\u201cGombe State is ready for you. These array of supporters that you see here are delegates. So, I make bold to say as the leader of this party, that these delegates that you see here are speaking with one voice and they know you have the capacity to deliver,\u201d the Governor said.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Chairman of the party, Nite Amangal, said there is no doubt the former Minister would deliver on good governance if given the opportunity due to his experience in public office.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cYour Excellency, Gombe is your second home. The delegates of Gombe will speak with one voice, and we know you have the capacity and experience to be the President of Nigeria. We pray that God will lead you through to be on the seat by 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmaechi, while addressing the delegates, assured that if elected as President, he would complete the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail line which goes through Gombe. He also appealed to the delegates to vote for him at the party\u2019s Presidential primaries slated for next weekend.\n\n\n\n\u201cVote for me, so that I can fly the party\u2019s flag and become the President of the country. If you support me, if you vote for me, be rest assured that I will deliver. I am not from the North, I am not from the South, I am not from the East, I am not from the West, I am from Nigeria. It simply means that I will represent you, whether you are a Christian or Muslim.\n\n\n\n\u201cTake the assurance that I understand the pains of poverty, get the assurance that I will bring my wealth of experience to bear. The Federal Government has approved the contract for the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri railway. It has been awarded, the contractor is on site. I hope they will continue to pursue the loan the way I was doing before I resigned. If they don\u2019t complete that project, when I become President, be rest assured that I will complete it,\u201d Amaechi stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Argues southwest angling for power makes no sense\n\n*Declares Nnamani, Onu are disadvantaged by age\n\n*Explains zoning is difficult after people had purchased forms\n\n*Says bandits attacked Kaduna train because they thought they were delegates coming to collect dollar in Abuja\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nWith just a few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), presidential hopeful and former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has described the trio of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and Senator Ibikunle Amosun \u2013 all contenders for the APC ticket \u2013 as unsuitable for Nigeria\u2019s current work plan.\n\n\n\nNwajiuba, however, described the three contenders to the office of president as nice people. But he insisted that it made no sense for anyone from the South-west to be pitching for the presidency of the country now, after former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s eight years in office and Osinbajo about to serve out another eight years as vice president.\n\n\n\nThe former minister spoke exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential series interview.\n\nHe said former President of the Senate, Senator Ken Nnamani, and former Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, were patriotic Nigerians with good intentions, but maintained they were disadvantaged by their ages, as they were above 60 years.\n\n\n\nOn the question of zoning, which some have called an albatross in the party, Nwajiuba explained that it became difficult the moment everyone was allowed to purchase nomination forms.\n\nHe suggested that the reason bandits recently attacked a Kaduna bound train might be because they thought most of the passengers were delegates heading to Abuja to share from a dollar rain by aspirants, who had monetised the nomination process.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Imo State-born lawyer, who resigned his ministerial post to contest for the presidency, \u201cYou may be a smart person in the 60s, but the knowledge of economy has moved beyond your era. You might have governed Lagos State before, but those people you trained are also doing fantastic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat, then, did not make the knowledge resident in only you. You could have great leaders like Asiwaju Tinubu or men like Ibikunle Amosun, even the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, who by their nature are very nice persons, they might not be suitable for the work plan now.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are those, who mean well but being challenged by the age factor, like the former senate president, Ken Nnamani. He is a lovely person, who has the interest of Nigerians at heart, but he may not be as strong as he used to be when he was in government. So, you must excuse him.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same thing applies to Ogbonnaya Onu, who also has the challenge of age. They are good men. We also have younger elements, like the governor of Kogi State, who, very agile in his 40s, but he has not garnered a nationalistic experience yet. He must be given room to grow.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many constraints for different aspirants. We need somebody, who has the empathy, the energy, the enthusiasm, and exact understanding of the experiences and knowledge that are required.\u201d\n\nStill on zoning and why some of his former colleagues in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet opted out of the presidential race, Nwajiuba said, \u201cYes, maybe because they did not study the time frame very well. I don\u2019t know whether they had certain other interpretations around it. Some may not have enough funds to pay for the forms.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbout 3,816 people contributed the money, which I used to buy my own form and I\u2019ve published their names. People contributed between N5, 000 and N500, 000 each within two weeks across the country. So, if we are going to build a consensus around the 24 aspirants, we will then talk about the location.\n\n\n\n\u201cNobody had zoned the positions before people started purchasing the forms. So, you cannot zone after they had purchased the forms. It is from the people, who are now available that you will look at what each aspirant is bringing to the table and how best would they solve Nigeria\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\n\n\nNwajiuba, who defended the decision by some northerners to join the race, said, \u201cThere are three people from the north, who purchased the APC presidential forms: President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello; and Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Mohammed Badaru. They all have the right credentials to be Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are men of foresight. They are from the North-east, North-central, and North-west. They are possibly in the contest to make a statement that if we are talking about national justice and fairness, we should only be thinking of the South-east. This is because it is the only zone in the south that has not produced president since 1999.\n\n\u201cHowever, for them to be seeing about eight people from the South-west suddenly laying claims to the same argument they had against the north makes it look very silly. This is because you cannot be accusing the north of something you are also perpetrating.\n\n\n\n\u201cOlusegun Obasanjo had been president for eight years; Osinbajo has been vice president since 2015. Why should the South-west say the north should cede power to the south and that they must be the beneficiary? How does that make any sense of any type?\n\n\n\n\u201cYet they are asking the young patriots in the north to cede power to them. I am sure if the South-west pulls out of the presidential race, aspirants from the north would also rest their ambitions and allow the South-east to produce Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\nAddressing allegations that he had not been going round to meet with delegates, probably, because he was complacent that Buhari already had his back, Nwajiuba said, \u201cMy job is how to organise the country. We have five delegates from each ward, including the chairman and the secretary. One of the remaining three delegates must be a woman. We were already a factor in every polling unit before the election started. That is how we think in modern times.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you like buy two aircraft and be crisscrossing the country, once you leave your destination, other people will go and dine there. That is not how politics is done. We don\u2019t need to do dollar bazar on the day of the presidential convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the bandits to come and attack us, like they did the last time, when they attacked the train going to Kaduna, because the bandits thought they were delegates, who had come to Abuja to collect dollars. If we insist on bringing everybody here and cause a naira rain in Abuja, how will the poor people survive?\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former banker and presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-deen, says he is in the race to change the character and complexion of Nigerian politics. Hayatu-deen said he was not a career politician, but only out to save the country from collapse, if elected president.\n\n\n\nHe made the assertions yesterday in Lagos during an interactive session with media executives.\n\nHayatu-deen said as an economist he knew what was needed to kick-start the economy and ensure Nigerians smiled again.\n\n\n\nHe regretted the current killings in the country, saying it started in a part of Borno State, but has now enveloped the whole North.\n\n\n\nThe aspirant added that bandits and ISWAP insurgents controlled areas about 40 kilometres outside major cities in the north. He lamented that Nigerians were only safer in the cities but in the villages, poor and vulnerable citizens, mainly children and women, were being killed.\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen said in the 80s and 90s, Nigerians used to shed tears whenever they heard that limbs were being cut in countries like Sierra Leone or when they heard about the genocide in Rwanda.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut today, we heard deaths in 50s and 60s, which is quite mind-boggling,\u201d he stated. \u201cThis is unacceptable and we have to deal with this.\u201d\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen added, \u201cAnd I can tell you that even if you increase the strength of the military by three, you will only be scratching the surface. We must not mistake the symptoms for the cause and that is why we have to look at the issue holistically and solve it once and for all.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to successfully deal with insecurity, it would must create \u201ceconomic, social as well as gender security\u201d.\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen said, \u201cWe are a country of 210 million people and from global statistics, Nigeria is one of the highest growing countries in the world if not the highest growing.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said there was nothing wrong with this if the country had the wherewithal to cater for the soaring population.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHigh population on its own is not bad as long as the country is ready to cater for the growing population. But the problem here is that we do not have any provision for these young Nigerians. As at now, we have over 170 million young Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said there was a connection between insecurity and the growing army of able-bodied young men and women who were not adequately catered for.\n\n\n\nHayatu-deen also spoke on the question of gender security, saying, \u201cOur women are hardworking and doing a lot of things, both for the society and the family. We need to encourage them and ensure they reach their peak. That glass ceiling has to be broken and allow them to reach the top.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his chances as an aspirant for the PDP presidential ticket, Hayatu-deen jokingly said he knew he was the rookie among the many career politicians jostling for the ticket. But he added that he drew inspiration from the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron, who, as investment banker, took the French political space by storm and won the presidency at less than 40 years of age.\n\n\n\nThe former managing director and chief executive officer of FSB International Bank believed a non-career politician could challenge the status quo and win. He said he was confident of victory in the race and equally sure of PDP\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nHe then challenged the media to play its role and ensure that the best candidates emerged in both parties.\n\nHayatu-deen stated, \u201cThe media has a lot of role to play in sensitising delegates in both parties to ensure they pick the right candidates. You have to do this for us and ensure that Nigeria is rescued.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said he would not accept any appointment even if his party won the election next year.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to help my nation. No one would accuse me of being a bystander and didn\u2019t join in trying to salvage the nation when it was burning. My father admonished me to see Nigeria as the centre of my universe and that is what it has been. I really love this nation,\u201d Hayatu-deen declared.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said there are plans to reconcile aggrieved aspirants after the presidential, governorship, senatorial and House of Representatives\u2019 primaries scheduled to take place from May 26 to 30.\n\n\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who stated this at a virtual town hall meeting, added that no grieving aspirant will leave the party after the party\u2019s primaries.\n\n\n\nAdamu, who was represented by his Special Assistant, Prof. Abdullahi Yau, disclosed this at the event organised under the aegis of the party Ward-to-ward Diaspora Network in collaboration with the APC Ward-to-ward Ambassadors on \u201cIntra-Party democracy for the Emergence of Best Candidates.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cDirectly, I want to tell you that after the primaries, none of the contestants of aspirants will leave the party. You can see unlike the other parties extending weight, in our party all our aspirants are calm.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Political Intrigues Between Two Corrupt Nigerian Public Figures Led To Detention, Grilling Of Former NDDC MD Over N47billion Fraud",
          "text": "The arrest of the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Nsima Ekere, has been linked to the political scheming by former Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nMr. Ekere was on his way to Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, in Nigeria's South-South region, when he received an invitation to report to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday.\n\nThe former NDDC boss was said to have promptly changed his travel plans and boarded a flight from Abuja where he resides to Lagos to honour the invitation of the anti-graft agency.\n\nOn arrival at the commission, he was confronted with accusations of corruptly enriching himself while serving as MD of the NDDC between November 2016 and January 2019 and was promptly detained.\n\nA statement issued by EFCC and posted on its website said Mr. Ekere was being held for alleged diversion of funds to the tune of N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nHowever, the EFCC released the former Managing Director of the NDDC, Ekere on Sunday.\n\nA source in the EFCC told SaharaReporters on Sunday that \"Ekere has been released on bail\".\n\nSee Also Corruption Alleged N47bn Fraud: Nigerian Anti-graft Agency, EFCC Releases Ex-Managing Director Of Niger Delta Development Commission, Nsima Ekere\n\nBut the details of the bail conditions were not known as of the time of filing this report.\n\nEkere was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly diverting N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nWhile details of the alleged fund's diversion by the former NDDC are still unknown, the timing of the arrest and the dramatic nature of it point to the high-level political power play in his home state of Akwa Ibom.\n\nIn Abuja and across Akwa Ibom, the word has been out that President Muhammadu Buhari was considering Mr. Ekere as the replacement to Mr. Akpabio at the Niger Delta Ministry.\n\nBut findings reveal that Mr. Akpabio is pushing for Etekamba Umoren, his chief of staff at the Niger Delta Ministry and a former Secretary to the Government of Akwa Ibom State during his tenure as governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nMany believe that Mr. Ekere\u2019s arrest and detention are meant to dent his nomination for the ministerial job and pave the way for the emergence of Mr. Umoren, who is a stooge of Mr. Akpabio.\n\nThe argument hinged on the fact that Mr. Akpabio has been serially indicted for corruption not only in the NDDC but also when he was the governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nSince 2020, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom has been embroiled in factional crises with Akpabio leading one faction and other leaders like Senator John Akpan Udoedeghe, Umana Okon Umana, Don Etiebiet and Mr. Ekere hauled together to wrest control of the party from the former Niger Delta Affairs minister.\n\nWhile Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction succeeded in using the court and his closeness to the centre of power to grab the chairmanship of the party, it has been tough uniting the members and getting them ready for the election.\n\nMr. Ekere, who was APC\u2019s governorship candidate at the last election, by the party convention, should be the leader of the party in the state.\n\nBut Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction has contested this position, insisting that the minister, as the highest-ranking political officer from the state, is the natural leader.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Ekere is said to have been making overtures to unite the party, share positions and integrate all factions into the mainstream, a position Mr. Akpabio, and his men are said to be stoutly objected to.\n\nMr. Ekere\u2019s other sin is his support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a frontline presidential aspirant in the ruling party and a major obstacle to Mr. Akpabio\u2019s ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the APC.\n\nIt is also learnt that Mr. Osinbajo first considered Mr. Akpabio as his presidential campaign coordinator in Akwa Ibom but switched to Mr. Ekere when the former Niger Delta minister declared to run for President.\n\nThe Vice President is said to have settled for Mr. Ekere because of his political reach and outlook.\n\nHistory Of Frosty Relationship Between Akpabio And Ekere\n\nMany insist that Mr. Akpabio has had a long frosty relationship with Mr. Ekere.\n\nThe duo contested the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) governorship primary in 2006 to succeed former Governor Victor Attah.\n\nHowever, the primary did not produce a clear winner and Mr. Akpabio negotiated victory which meant he had to name Mr. Ekere as his running mate.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Ekere was dropped based on a negotiated term by the PDP to allow Mr. Attah to nominate the deputy governorship candidate in the person of Patrick Ekpotu.\n\nMr. Ekpotu served for one term and Mr. Ekere was picked to run with Mr. Akpabio in 2011, a ploy many said was to retire the man from politics.\n\nJust as he was being sworn in, a plan was hatched to impeach Mr. Ekere a few months into the office so he would not be able to contest for any elective position.\n\nMr. Ekere escaped that fate by resigning a day before the house of assembly was to start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nEven with his resignation, the lawmakers were still bent on going ahead with his impeachment process.\n\nMr. Ekere moved to the APC in 2015 after he was frustrated out of the governorship race.\n\nHe and many APC leaders at the time had resisted Mr. Akpabio\u2019s moves to decamp to the party when he negotiated to join the party after the EFCC arrested and filed corruption charges against him.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom APC leaders were also said to have argued that the corruption baggage on Mr. Akpabio\u2019s neck, while he was governor, would work against the party at the election.\n\nAkpabio joined APC in 2018, contested and lost the senatorial election but got rewarded with an appointment as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nMany people see him more as the Minister of NDDC which has had five chief executives since 2019.\n\nAkpabio's Corruption Cases\n\nMeanwhile, Akpabio was also detained in April 2021 after he attempted to bribe the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, SaharaReporters had reported.\n\nAccording to sources, Akpabio was trying to bribe the EFCC Chairman because of the tons of corruption allegations against him, dating back to the time he was governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nIt was learnt that the meeting between Akpabio and Bawa was arranged by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had recently been embroiled in a N5 million bribery controversy himself.\n\nAkpabio was said to have taken the $350,000 in cash personally to Bawa before he was detained.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it took a call from the Aso Villa to the EFCC Chairman to get Akpabio and his aides released.\n\nA top source in the EFCC had said, \"He arrived at the EFCC office with five others and headed to meet the newly appointed Chairman, Bawa.\n\n\"The Attorney General of the Federation who was recently arranged the meeting for the minister. You remember his bribery issue with Malami himself involving $5 million.\n\n\"He was ushered in at 1 pm to see the EFCC chairman while carrying the money personally. He was arrested and detained, along with his aides, all six of them. It was a call from the Villa that got him released after two hours.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Akpabio had also bribed Malami and others with $5 million to get Effiong Akwa appointed as the sole administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission, an allegation both of them denied.\n\nThere had also been allegations of N40 billion fraud perpetrated in the NDDC which was under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry, explaining the pressure on Akpabio to clear the weight of corruption allegations hanging on his neck.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives had in 2020 resolved to probe the alleged N40 billion financial recklessness of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC in the previous three months.\n\nBut Akpabio, whose ministry supervised the agency, swiftly released a statement entitled \u201cRe: National Assembly probes alleged N40bn corruption in NDDC\u201d, saying under the supervision of the Niger Delta Affairs ministry, no corruption had been recorded in the NDDC\n\nAlso, there had been allegations of over N86 billion contract scam involving Akpabio and the former Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, which the EFCC had been looking into.\n\nNoting the pressure on Akpabio, another source had said, \"Don't forget he has tons of corruption cases with the EFCC right from when he was a governor. And now with NDDC scams in billions, he is under a lot of pressure.\n\n\"When Akpabio was released, he called Malami, who had arranged his meeting with the EFCC chairmen, frantically asking him to drive to the EFCC office to explain to Bawa that he didn\u2019t mean to cause him any harm by bribing him but Malami said he was sick.\n\n\"Malami told him he had just returned from Turkey after which he travelled to Sokoto and collapsed in public.\"\n\nSaharaReporters had on April 15, 2021reported how Malami collapsed in Sokoto state while he was there for the inauguration of the reconstructed State High Court complex by Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nMalami had collapsed after delivering his address at the ceremony and was quickly revived by his aides and dignitaries.\n\nHe was subsequently hospitalised at a private facility upon his return to Abuja.",

not known as of the time of filing this report.\n\nEkere was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly diverting N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nWhile details of the alleged fund's diversion by the former NDDC are still unknown, the timing of the arrest and the dramatic nature of it point to the high-level political power play in his home state of Akwa Ibom.\n\nIn Abuja and across Akwa Ibom, the word has been out that President Muhammadu Buhari was considering Mr. Ekere as the replacement to Mr. Akpabio at the Niger Delta Ministry.\n\nBut findings reveal that Mr. Akpabio is pushing for Etekamba Umoren, his chief of staff at the Niger Delta Ministry and a former Secretary to the Government of Akwa Ibom State during his tenure as governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nMany believe that Mr. Ekere\u2019s arrest and detention are meant to dent his nomination for the ministerial job and pave the way for the emergence of Mr. Umoren, who is a stooge of Mr. Akpabio.\n\nThe argument hinged on the fact that Mr. Akpabio has been serially indicted for corruption not only in the NDDC but also when he was the governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nSince 2020, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom has been embroiled in factional crises with Akpabio leading one faction and other leaders like Senator John Akpan Udoedeghe, Umana Okon Umana, Don Etiebiet and Mr. Ekere hauled together to wrest control of the party from the former Niger Delta Affairs minister.\n\nWhile Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction succeeded in using the court and his closeness to the centre of power to grab the chairmanship of the party, it has been tough uniting the members and getting them ready for the election.\n\nMr. Ekere, who was APC\u2019s governorship candidate at the last election, by the party convention, should be the leader of the party in the state.\n\nBut Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction has contested this position, insisting that the minister, as the highest-ranking political officer from the state, is the natural leader.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Ekere is said to have been making overtures to unite the party, share positions and integrate all factions into the mainstream, a position Mr. Akpabio, and his men are said to be stoutly objected to.\n\nMr. Ekere\u2019s other sin is his support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a frontline presidential aspirant in the ruling party and a major obstacle to Mr. Akpabio\u2019s ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the APC.\n\nIt is also learnt that Mr. Osinbajo first considered Mr. Akpabio as his presidential campaign coordinator in Akwa Ibom but switched to Mr. Ekere when the former Niger Delta minister declared to run for President.\n\nThe Vice President is said to have settled for Mr. Ekere because of his political reach and outlook.\n\nHistory Of Frosty Relationship Between Akpabio And Ekere\n\nMany insist that Mr. Akpabio has had a long frosty relationship with Mr. Ekere.\n\nThe duo contested the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) governorship primary in 2006 to succeed former Governor Victor Attah.\n\nHowever, the primary did not produce a clear winner and Mr. Akpabio negotiated victory which meant he had to name Mr. Ekere as his running mate.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Ekere was dropped based on a negotiated term by the PDP to allow Mr. Attah to nominate the deputy governorship candidate in the person of Patrick Ekpotu.\n\nMr. Ekpotu served for one term and Mr. Ekere was picked to run with Mr. Akpabio in 2011, a ploy many said was to retire the man from politics.\n\nJust as he was being sworn in, a plan was hatched to impeach Mr. Ekere a few months into the office so he would not be able to contest for any elective position.\n\nMr. Ekere escaped that fate by resigning a day before the house of assembly was to start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nEven with his resignation, the lawmakers were still bent on going ahead with his impeachment process.\n\nMr. Ekere moved to the APC in 2015 after he was frustrated out of the governorship race.\n\nHe and many APC leaders at the time had resisted Mr. Akpabio\u2019s moves to decamp to the party when he negotiated to join the party after the EFCC arrested and filed corruption charges against him.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom APC leaders were also said to have argued that the corruption baggage on Mr. Akpabio\u2019s neck, while he was governor, would work against the party at the election.\n\nAkpabio joined APC in 2018, contested and lost the senatorial election but got rewarded with an appointment as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nMany people see him more as the Minister of NDDC which has had five chief executives since 2019.\n\nAkpabio's Corruption Cases\n\nMeanwhile, Akpabio was also detained in April 2021 after he attempted to bribe the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, SaharaReporters had reported.\n\nAccording to sources, Akpabio was trying to bribe the EFCC Chairman because of the tons of corruption allegations against him, dating back to the time he was governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nIt was learnt that the meeting between Akpabio and Bawa was arranged by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had recently been embroiled in a N5 million bribery controversy himself.\n\nAkpabio was said to have taken the $350,000 in cash personally to Bawa before he was detained.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it took a call from the Aso Villa to the EFCC Chairman to get Akpabio and his aides released.\n\nA top source in the EFCC had said, \"He arrived at the EFCC office with five others and headed to meet the newly appointed Chairman, Bawa.\n\n\"The Attorney General of the Federation who was recently arranged the meeting for the minister. You remember his bribery issue with Malami himself involving $5 million.\n\n\"He was ushered in at 1 pm to see the EFCC chairman while carrying the money personally. He was arrested and detained, along with his aides, all six of them. It was a call from the Villa that got him released after two hours.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Akpabio had also bribed Malami and others with $5 million to get Effiong Akwa appointed as the sole administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission, an allegation both of them denied.\n\nThere had also been allegations of N40 billion fraud perpetrated in the NDDC which was under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry, explaining the pressure on Akpabio to clear the weight of corruption allegations hanging on his neck.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives had in 2020 resolved to probe the alleged N40 billion financial recklessness of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC in the previous three months.\n\nBut Akpabio, whose ministry supervised the agency, swiftly released a statement entitled \u201cRe: National Assembly probes alleged N40bn corruption in NDDC\u201d, saying under the supervision of the Niger Delta Affairs ministry, no corruption had been recorded in the NDDC\n\nAlso, there had been allegations of over N86 billion contract scam involving Akpabio and the former Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, which the EFCC had been looking into.\n\nNoting the pressure on Akpabio, another source had said, \"Don't forget he has tons of corruption cases with the EFCC right from when he was a governor. And now with NDDC scams in billions, he is under a lot of pressure.\n\n\"When Akpabio was released, he called Malami, who had arranged his meeting with the EFCC chairmen, frantically asking him to drive to the EFCC office to explain to Bawa that he didn\u2019t mean to cause him any harm by bribing him but Malami said he was sick.\n\n\"Malami told him he had just returned from Turkey after which he travelled to Sokoto and collapsed in public.\"\n\nSaharaReporters had on April 15, 2021reported how Malami collapsed in Sokoto state while he was there for the inauguration of the reconstructed State High Court complex by Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nMalami had collapsed after delivering his address at the ceremony and was quickly revived by his aides and dignitaries.\n\nHe was subsequently hospitalised at a private facility upon his return to Abuja.",

The president of the senate, Ahmad Lawan; the governor of Kogi state, Yahaya Bello; and the governor of Jigawa state, Abubakar Mohammed Badaru,\u201d Nwajuiba said.\n\n\u201cThey all have the right credentials to be Nigeria\u2019s president. They are men of foresight. They are from the north-east, north-central and north-west.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey are possibly in the contest to make a statement but if we are talking about national justice and fairness, we should only be thinking of the south-east. This is because it is the only zone in the south that had not produced a president since 1999.\n\n\u201cHowever, for them to be seeing about eight people from the south-west suddenly laying claims to the same argument they had against the north, makes it look very silly.\n\n\u201cThis is because you cannot be accusing the north of something you are also perpetrating. Olusegun Obasanjo had been president for eight years; Osinbajo has been vice president since 2015.\n\n\u201cWhy should the south-west say the north should cede power to the south and that they must be the beneficiary? How does that make any sense of any type? Yet, they are asking the young patriots in the north to cede power to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am sure if the south-west pulls out of the presidential race, aspirants from the north would also rest their ambitions and allow the south-east to produce Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\u201d\n\nNwajuiba was the first presidential hopeful in the president\u2019s cabinet to step down from office.\n\nOn April 27, Project Nigeria, a support group, allegedly bought the N100 million expression of interest and nomination forms for the former minister.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

The law defines the \u201cvulnerable group\u201d in society as \u201cChildren under five, pregnant women, aged, physically and mentally challenged persons, and indigent people as may be defined from time to time\u201d.\n\nThis new law is stated in the new National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari last week.\n\nThe provisions of Section 26 sub-section 1c of the Act states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes \u201ctelecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\u201d\n\nOther sources of income for the Vulnerable Group Fund include the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, health insurance levies, grants, donations, gifts, and any other voluntary contributions. The law also requires that all persons resident in Nigeria are expected to obtain health insurance.\n\nWith average call rates of 11 Kobo per second, this new act implies that there will be a tax of at least 9% on every second of all phone calls made in Nigeria.\n\nNigerians made 150.83 billion minutes of calls in 2020 according to a report by the Nigerian Communications Commission. This translates to 9.05 trillion seconds of calls, meaning the new tax will generate at least 9.05 trillion Kobo, which converts to \u20a690.49 billion ($18.09 million), annually.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when this new tax will take effect and how much it\u2019ll be but it hints that there\u2019ll be an increase in call-tariffs in Nigeria, as it\u2019s unlikely that the telecom companies will absorb the cost.\n\nLast month, telecom companies under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria proposed a 40% increase in the cost of calls, SMS, and data as a result of the rising cost of operating in the country. This new tax creates a more compelling case for the telcos to hike their prices.\n\nShare this article",

Bolu should have a rundown of all that went down.\n\nIf you were there or watched online, please tell me about what you did and saw. Did you meet new people? If you missed it or want to rewatch it, kindly click this link.\n\nSo, today I\u2019ll talk about two interesting stories from the previous week:\n\nYC\u2019s warning to startup founders\n\nCBN proposed open bank data\n\nYC warns startup founders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US may be headed for a recession in 2023 or later this year, 2022, as Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) fell in the previous two quarters. In addition, due to high inflation, the country\u2019s interest rates are rising.\n\nConsequently, to weather the coming recession, Y Combinator (YC) has advised its founders to cut costs and plan for the worst. Why? As the economy slows, funding is likely to reduce.\n\nYou should be familiar with YC by this point. \ud83d\ude09 The firm, which is one of the largest in the world, has invested in over 3,000 startups, with 51 from Nigeria and over 13 coming from other African countries.\n\nI won\u2019t go into much detail, but if you want to learn more about how YC is changing the African startup game, you can download the report here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, companies appear to be laying off employees. And while some private companies are tightening up their boots, some venture capitalists are withholding checks.\n\nConcerning the latter, recall that SoftBank announced that it would become much more selective in its investments following a $27.7 billion loss on investments in its Vision Fund for its just-ended fiscal year.\n\nAlso, firms like Tiger Global and D1 Capital are reportedly reducing late-stage investments.\n\nBesides, in the letter, YC said, \u201cIf your plan is to raise money in the next 6-12 months, you might be raising at the peak of the downturn\u2026\u201d\n\nRemember that funding news slowed in April 2022. Apparently, it wasn\u2019t an African thing; it was a global problem. For context, listen to this: Why funding news slowed down in April.\n\nSo African companies, particularly those that spend their capital quickly or do not generate enough profit, will struggle.\n\nFor example, startups that previously raised a round in 2020 or 2021 could find it challenging to raise subsequent rounds at a higher valuation because raising funds at a lower valuation may imply the company\u2019s weakness, undermining the confidence of any existing investors in the business.\n\nBesides that, because venture capitalists prefer to keep their money in portfolio companies, they will be less likely to make new investments. This implies that startups may have to rely on customers for revenue.\n\nIf you ask me, that\u2019s not a bad thing. But nobody asked me. For context, please listen here.\n\nCBN wants to share your data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Businesstimes.ng\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has proposed the regulatory framework for open banking in the country.\n\nWhy? They want to encourage innovation and broaden the range of financial products and services available to bank customers and improve data sharing across banking and payment systems.\n\nThis proposal comes a year after the CBN first indicated plans to formalise open banking by defining four types of data that can be exchanged. It is doubly interesting that rumblings on the matter had already begun as far back as 2018, as you can see in this story on Open Banking Nigeria.\n\nSo, what comes to mind when you hear open banking? An open bank? \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 I didn\u2019t say so, though.\n\nWhat is it then? Open banking, also known as \u201copen bank data,\u201d is a system that allows third-party applications \u2014 startups and online financial service vendors \u2014 to access and control consumer banking and financial accounts. This breaks banks\u2019 monopoly on the use of customer data.\n\nHow does it work? Because open banking relies on networks rather than centralisation, customers are typically required to provide consent to allow the bank to grant such access.\n\nThen, APIs from third-party providers can access the customer\u2019s shared data (and data about the customer\u2019s financial counterparties).\n\nMeanwhile, the CBN stated that \u201cparticipants in open banking shall adhere strictly to security standards when accessing and storing data, and shall be subject to minimum privacy standards, operational standards, risk management standards, and customer experience standards as prescribed by the Bank.\u201d\n\nOpen banking carries as many risks as it does potential rewards. This includes serious threats to financial privacy and the security of consumers\u2019 finance and resulting liabilities for financial institutions.\n\nWant to know how open banking can improve financial inclusion?

It\u2019s not just about consuming my content and knowing how I\u2019m faring.\n\nPlease keep me updated on how you\u2019re doing, too. Also, engage my newsletter by leaving your thoughts and encouraging others to subscribe. Promise to do it? Pinky swear? I believe you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, I\u2019m excited today, and you know why! \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a Tomorrow is the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Africa Summit (TABS)! Well, honestly, it\u2019s been a stressful week for the Techpoint Africa team. But, you know what? It\u2019s over already. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve registered, you\u2019ll see all the fantastic things we\u2019ve packaged just for you tomorrow. However, all tickets, including giveaways, are sold out.\n\nSo, prepare your NFT and web3 questions. You also don\u2019t want to miss the exhibition booth, networking, and the hackathon\u2019s grand finale. You\u2019re excited too, aren\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude09 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nIf you do not have a ticket to the physical event, you can register online for free here.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\nNetflix\u2019s Mystery Box\n\nTikTok\u2019s plan to credit creators\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory Farms, a Kenyan-based startup, has raised $5 million in new funding.\n\nEd Brakeman, a senior managing director at Bain Capital and Hans den Bieman, Founder and ex-CEO of Mowi, a company that claims to be one of the world\u2019s largest salmon businesses, led the investment.\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Joseph Rehmann (CEO), Victory Farms is a tilapia aquaculture startup and farm with hatcheries, nursery ponds, and deep-water cages.\n\nThe company claims to have grown twice as fast as any other African fish company. Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLast week, our organisation organized a 2-day seminar for CSOs and journalists on enhancing advocacy skills on anti-corruption and social inclusive reform issues in Nigeria. It was tagged Enhancing Anti-corruption and Social Inclusive Reform Initiatives in Nigeria. It is designed to enhance local civil society organizations\u2019 ability to be positive and responsible change agents in Nigeria.\n\nThe Enhancing Anti-corruption and Social Inclusive Reform Initiatives in Nigeria project is designed following the anchor cluster model adopted by Palladium to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms. This project works with us as \u2018anchor\u2019 organisation working with 8 cluster member organizations spread across six states and the Federal Capital Territory. The States are Abia, Edo, Delta, Imo, Ondo, Rivers and the FCT, Abuja. ANEEJ is working with the eight cluster members located in these states including the FCT to implement and deliver this project.\n\nThe cluster organisations are: 21st Century Community Empowerment for youth and Women Initiative, Abuja; Community Empowerment and Development Initiative (CEDI), Warri, Delta State; Community Heritage Watch for Development Initiative, (KAI) Akure, Ondo State; Christian Fellowship and Care Foundation (CFCF), Owerri, Imo State; Foundation for Environmental Rights, Advocacy and Development (FENRAD), Aba, Abia State; Gender and Development Action (GADA) Port-Harcourt, Rivers State; Joint Association of Persons with Disability (JONAPWD) Edo State Chapter; and New Apostolic Church Centre for Development (NCD), Benin City, Edo State.\n\nWe consider this project as an important one that seeks to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms at both the national and sub-national levels with an ultimate goal of strengthening governance to deliver development goals to citizens, particularly in addressing poverty and inequality amongst our people.\n\nIt will interest you to know that aside the anti-corruption component, the project is also designed to address reforms as well as issues of transparency and accountability in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and six oil and gas producing states \u2013 Abia, Delta, Edo, Imo, Rivers and Ondo. This explains why participation and cluster members were drawn from these states.\n\nDuring the course of implementing this project, interventions will include advocacy for passage/adoption of pending Anti-Corruption Bills, the National Anti-corruption Strategy (NACS II) and the NDDC Act Amendment Bill currently before the national assembly. The project will also support oversight and implementation of the Nigeria\u2019s International anti-corruption/asset recovery commitments; Oil and Gas Producing Areas Development Commissions among others. Our cluster currently advocates for the mainstreaming of anti-corruption issues into the country upcoming 2023 general elections discourse. Some of which are already ongoing as CSOs jointly called on political aspirants to mainstream issues of anti-corruption in the upcoming general elections during the learning event held in Benin City in April. If you watched Good morning show on NTA last Tuesday, I spoke extensively about addressing corruption issues during elections, we must move away from the culture and norms that promote corruption and create incentive for those who are not willing to buy votes, induce voters and rig elections.\n\nAs you know, the Proceeds of Crime Bill (POCA) has just been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari which gives a working instrument for the anti-corruption agencies like the EFCC, ICPC and CCB to work collaboratively and solve corruption problems in Nigeria. Since POCA has been passed and accented to, there are others on the queue such as the Whistleblower Protection Bill and the Witness Protection Bill. We should work together to see how our collective effort can result in the passage of these bills and others.\n\nThe two-day workshop is specifically designed for CSOs and journalists from the project benefiting States. We want to see how to enhance your advocacy skills on some of the issues highlighted above and others necessary to advance anti-corruption reforms in Nigeria as well as drive transparency and accountability in management of oil revenues accruing to oil producing states.\n\nAfter the workshop, we want to see change agents from among us here, who, with the right knowledge having been trained can use the acquired knowledge to hold government accountable, advocate and push for reforms and the passage of other relevant pending anti-corruption bills. This is particularly important because the project is hinged on the premix that when CSOs and journalists are trained on anti-corruption and social inclusive reforms issues, and they have the right knowledge and skills to engage government collaboratively based on existing data, they will be able to carry out evidence-based advocacy for reforms. Then, they can also influence the development of policies, passage of laws on anti-corruption and social inclusive reforms issues. This is what we aim to achieve with this two-days training and at the end, develop advocacy plan to support the passage of pending anti-corruption bills and other anti-corruption and social inclusive reform issues.\n\nI urge Nigerians to participate with keen interest in these issues to put us all on track of the current political economic analysis and how we can collaboratively engage relevant stakeholders at both national and state levels to drive key reforms.\n\n_______________\n\nRev Ugolor is Executive director ANEEJ.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) is acclaimed as one of the transparent educational projects on the continent and we want to extend it to impact on more children in Edo.\n\n\u201cOur teachers are all having modern devices; they are trained and retrained. They are focused on the child to ensure they impact learning on the children. We will extend this programme to the barracks and other places where we have schools. We don\u2019t see any difference between the child in the barracks and the outside.\n\n\u201cOur goal as a state is to train between 5,000 and 10,000 people in software development, programming and coding, among others before I leave office.

Ejike Mbaka, has showered blessings on Barth Nnaji, former minister of power and one of the aspirants for the governorship of Enugu State.\n\nMbaka gave the blessing when Nnaji celebrated mass at the Adoration ground officiated by the priest in Emene, on Sunday.\n\nThe fiery priest prayed God to fulfill Nnaji\u2019s desires and to guide Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in the decision of who to settle for as his preferred successor, while noting that Nnaji as an industrialist and a power generator who has the annoting of God in his endeavor.\n\nMbaka said: \u201cHe (Bart Nnaji) is one of the governorship aspirants in Enugu and he has come to be with us. He is a great son of Wawa, a great man in the land of Umuode, a power generator. It will be well with you. My prayer for you is that the will of God be done.\n\n\u201cOne of my children will become the Governor after Gburugburu ( Governor Ugwuanyi). We are also prayering for Gburugburu so that God will give him the wisdom, the grace, the favour to select a man after God\u2019s own heart. That is my prayer for him in Jesus name.\n\n\u201cThe person of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is in tandem with peace. There may not be too much flyovers in Enugu but there is peace. By midnight you see the people of Enugu walking about the streets fearlessly without security. The white men that came here the other day assessed it and I thank God for the good people of Enugu State that supported him to achieve it. The youths of Enugu, it shall be well with you.\n\n\u201cSo, that is why I am praying for Gburugburu so that he will not make a mistake because one single mistake will put people in trouble. None of the politicians who are aspiring to be governor will expose his inner will. What you see are people who are not real. None of them is saying things from their heart, but we are waiting. Anyone they bring we will work for the people. If he wants peace, we will give him peace, if he wants to toy with the poor, we will chase him out of the seat.\n\n\u201cBut we are praying so that God will give us someone who is sane, a tested and trusted personality, a competent hand, a father, a lover, an industrialist, a visionary, a godly person, a down to earth humble personality. We need a compassionate, empathic and sympathetic personality. Someone with a good heart and a good person.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need terrorism in this state. We don\u2019t want to hear that this one is in this cult while the other person is in another cult and then a cult war will start. They are all our children but we need a father to be governor so he will bring the the entire Enugu together. Anyone who enters Enugu will know that he has entered a land of peace.\n\n\u201cBecause our people can survive even if you don\u2019t help them. My prayer is that he selects a man of peace, a good man. I am not recommending anyone to him but I am praying that God puts a good man into his heart.\u201d",

          "title": "Dissecting FG\u2019s Withdrawal Of Nigeria From Int\u2019l Basketball Competitions",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s government fortnight announced the withdrawal of the country from all international basketball competitions for a period of two years due to unabated leadership tussle in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF).\n\nThe pronouncement which came amidst preparations by both the D\u2019Tigers and D\u2019Tigress for upcoming engagements has been erroneously or purposefully condemned by several commentators.\n\nHowever, close watchers of the power tussle within the NBBF in the last five years believe the federal government\u2019s decision was long overdue and did not come as a surprise because there have been similar calls from different quarters in the past, but the government adamantly refused to listen hoping that common sense will prevail.\n\nThe main function of a national sport federation is to provide more opportunities for people to get involved, increase participation levels and help people progress their level of sport along a \u2018sport development continuum\u2019.\n\nBut for five years the gladiators in the NBBF watched the local talents wasted away as their fight for self-benefit cripple the domestic basketball league and denied the local talents opportunities to be spotted by club scouts.\n\nThe basketball courts in the country were shut down while administrators fought for the control of the sport and just like the saying that when two elephants are fighting, it\u2019s the grass that suffers. Nigeria\u2019s basketball was hit to its lowest point in the home front.\n\nFirstly, the loss of the Kwese title sponsorship of a $12 million five-year deal after its first year. The inaugural season saw Champions Kano Pillars go home with N20 million naira and a N25 million split at N15m and N10m for the first and second runners up. It was the highest prize money paid for any professional sports league in Nigeria and the entire West Africa region.\n\nThe battle has now extended into five years and a lot of clubs have folded up due to the inability to sustain income and generate income from sponsors as Zenith Bank also bagged out of sponsorship of women basketball league and the players have been left the game in droves with no choice but to become artisans in order to make a living since their beloved sport and income source has been taken away.\n\nNot only players have suffered the lack of a domestic league, the coaches too have also had to bear the brunt with the chief coach of Kano Pillars Basketball Club, Sani Ahmed narrated his ordeal of the leadership crisis in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) to LEADERSHIP Sports recently.\n\nHe said the inactive domestic basketball league dragged the clubs backward and made it difficult catering for members of his family without the usual stipends and match-winning bonuses from competitions. \u201cIt was not easy for us, but I thank God that Madam understands the situation,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\n\u201cMost of the home based basketball players depend on the allowance they get from competitions to feed their family and pay their children school fees and so on.\n\n\u201cThe inactiveness of the domestic leagues for four years have dragged the teams backwards and affected the players.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the players could not aspire for anything because the dream of every player is to play for his national teams but when there is no league, no hope for the home-based players. Most of them have decided not to play basketball again, but I hope it will begin to change for the better now that the Federal Ministry Youth and Sports has intervened in the lingering crisis in NBBF.\u201d\n\nWith no domestic season and match rustiness, the continental club championship windows were slammed while the national team coaches\u2019 call-up has been offered to their foreign counterparts for the aforementioned reasons not necessarily because of a better record of performance.\n\nNigerians would be glad to note that the Nigeria women\u2019s basketball team, D\u2019Tigress took a stand as a team after they lamented the poor treatment being meted out to them by the NBBF officials. In a video posted on social media, members of the team individually expressed their disappointment and anger, calling out the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) and threatened to boycott future international call-ups by the Federation.\n\nIn the video, D\u2019Tigress players outlined the injustices allegedly perpetrated on them by the board of the NBBF, led by Engr. Musa Kida.\n\nTheir male counterparts, D\u2019Tigers, signed a petition that they will no longer play forNigeria unless an individual was removed as President NBBF.\n\n\u201cIn light of the mismanagement issues experience during the Tokyo Olympics, Afrobasket Qualifiers, and within the domestic league, please consider this signed petition our official declaration that we will not participate in any future national team competitions until the resignation of Musa Kida as NBBF president has been effected,\u201d the D\u2019Tigers stated in a petition signed by 15 of the players.\n\nWhile the impasse continues, there have been concerns raised for the management of basketball with the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development paying the D\u2019Tigress their $100, 000 meant for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games from the NBBF Central Bank account.\n\nThe Ministry also in an attempt to safeguard Nigeria\u2019s slot for the 2022 Basketball African League went ahead to conduct the Final 8 phase of the Nigeria Premier, but FIBA Africa in collaboration with one of the factions of NBBF banned Nigeria from participating in Basketball Africa League (BLA) because of leadership disagreements. The Ministry and Federal Government were misrepresented several times to FIBA by elements from the factions and was threatened with a ban for interference.\n\nEvery direct and indirect effort made to many stakeholders by the Ministry to reconcile the wary factions ended in deaf eyes while FIBA rejected government invitations to visit Nigeria and step into the basketball crisis.\n\nThough the withdrawal of the national teams from international basketball competitions can\u2019t be a welcome development, Nigerians should understand the government\u2019s predicament in taking such a harsh decision to revamp the sport from the grassroots than watch some characters continue ruining the future of thousands of basketball stars in the country.",

          "text": "The Royal Court in Jersey has seized nearly \u00a32m of dirty money transferred into local bank accounts by General Jerry Useni, a right-hand man of late dictator Sani Abacha.\n\nJeremiah Timbut Useni has been a significant public figure in Nigerian politics for a quarter of a century, and was the second most senior officer under the rule of General Abacha between 1993 and 1998.\n\nGen Useni first opened an account in Jersey in 1986 in the name of \u2018Mr Tim Shani\u2019, who the general later admitted did not exist and he was the true account holder.\n\nOver the next 15 years, money totalling \u00a31.9m was transferred into four accounts held by \u2018Mr Shani\u2019 with Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nIn 2001, the bank wrote to Gen Useni \u2013 believing him to be \u2018Mr Shani\u2019 \u2013 informing him that changes to anti-money laundering legislation in Jersey had resulted in stricter regulations, including the need to have a certified copy of his passport.\n\nIn response, six months later, \u2018Mr Shani\u2019 requested that the entire balance in his existing accounts be transferred to a Nigerian bank, in which it transpires that Gen Useni was a shareholder.\n\nThis request was rejected and in February 2003, the bank was refused permission to operate the accounts by the police\u2019s Joint Financial Crimes Unit.\n\nThere followed several attempts by Gen Useni\u2019s lawyer to unfreeze the accounts and, in 2007, Gen Useni finally identified himself as the true owner of the Shani accounts.\n\nGiving his occupation as \u2018Lieutenant-General\u2019, he informed Standard Chartered that the main source of his wealth was derived from the profits of his multiple businesses, which included transportation, hotel hospitality, petrol stations, personal savings and property investment.\n\nHe said the reason for opening a Jersey-based account was for \u201csecurity\u201d as it was \u201cnecessary to hold a proportion of wealth outside of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHowever, the bank asked Gen Useni to explain the source of the money and why he had transferred it to the accounts, as well as \u201csupporting documentation to back up the provenance of the funds\u201d and \u201ca full explanation as to why the account was originally opened up under a different name\u201d.\n\nAlthough in correspondence the following year, Gen Useni said he dealt in \u201cproperty investment where I sell some and put some in rent\u201d and owned a shopping centre, two petrol stations and a domestic gas station, a farm and a rice mill, he provided no information about his income in the 1980s and 1900s.\n\nHe added that he had not set up the original account in a false name, rather he had used a \u2018coded password name\u2019 as advised by the person who had set it up on his behalf.\n\nHowever, he did not explain why he had used \u2018Tim Shani\u2019, with Jersey\u2019s Attorney General concluding that he did so in order to further distance himself from the ownership of assets that had a likely criminal origin.\n\nIn a judgment handed down Thursday, setting out its decision to order the transfer of the \u00a32m into the island\u2019s Criminal Offences Confiscation Fund\u2019, the Royal Court said: \u201cThe Attorney General believes that the Shani accounts were created to hold, hide and conceal bribes or other proceeds of corruption received by Useni during the period he held office.\n\n\u201cThe payments into the Shani accounts were more likely than not for the purposes or on account of exercising political influence over the award of lucrative contracts to foreign and Nigerian companies for the supply of industrial or commercial services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf this conduct had occurred in Jersey, it would have constituted the customary law offence of misconduct in a public office.\u201d\n\nThrough a Jersey-based lawyer, Gen Useni fought but failed to prevent the seizure. In a written affidavit, he explained the source of the funds.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with a culture of gift-giving in Nigeria, which is still accepted practice in Nigeria, government officials from time to time receive cash gifts from friends and well-wishers during festive seasons.\n\n\u201cThese acts are similar to gifts being provided by Members of Parliament in England or corporate gifts being provided to directors / employees.\n\n\u201cThe culture needs to be looked at in the context of when I was a government official, and at that material time, save there being a culture of gift-giving, there was no official code of conduct governing the issue.\n\n\u201cThis could also be said to be true for the western governments, from what I know, so Nigeria should not be chastised or criticised for this.\u201d\n\nExplaining the use of a name of a fictitious person to set up the original account, he said: \u201cThe primary reason for this again was nothing sinister, but for my own protection. As you will understand from reviewing Nigeria\u2019s history, it has had a number of coups, and we are now on our fifth republic.\n\n\u201cThe governmental regimes are unstable, and if rulers came into office who were not friendly to my political persuasion, my wealth and safety could be on the line.\u201d\n\nHe added that the money constituted savings for his retirement and there had not been a code of conduct in place in Nigeria at the time obliging him to declare it.\n\nHowever, the Royal Court was not convinced by these explanations.\n\nIt said: \u201cEssentially, [Gen Useni\u2019s] case is that the source of the substantial sums paid into the bank accounts is cash gifts from friends, relatives and well-wishers on festive and other ceremonial occasions in accordance with Nigerian custom, but in the view of the Court it is simply not credible that friends, relatives and well-wishers would make gifts to [Gen Useni], as a public official, of such magnitude to allow him not only to accumulate millions in these bank accounts, but to acquire the very substantial assets he said he owned in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is an explanation that verges on the absurd.\u201d\n\nIt also found that there had been a code of conduct for public officials in place in Nigeria well before substantial amounts were paid into the Jersey accounts.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cThe affidavits of [Gen Useni] have not satisfied the Court that the property held in the bank accounts is not tainted property and on the application of the Attorney General, we will make a Forfeiture Order in relation to that property.\n\nThe Court also ordered that \u00a345,000 be taken out of the amount seized to pay Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s legal costs.\n\nThe Criminal Offences Confiscation Fund can be drawn on to support measures to prevent crime or paid out to entities with whom Jersey has an asset-sharing arrangement.\n\nIn 2020, Jersey returned more than \u00a3230m of money to Nigeria which had been laundered through the United States and the island by Gen Abacha.\n\nJersey, officially called the Bailiwick of Jersey is an island country and self-governing Crown Dependency near the coast of north-west France.\n\n*This story was culled from Bailiwick Express",

          "text": "The cloud over who emerges the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 general elections got darker, Sunday, as the governing party postponed its presidential screening earlier scheduled for Monday 23rd of May 2022.\n\nThe development came as some stakeholders, including aspirants of the South-east extraction and former Speaker House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole, also a presidential aspirant, are mulling the idea of consensus arrangement to produce the party\u2019s flag bearer in the presidential contest.\n\nBut Borno state Governor Professor Babagana Zulum is of the view that President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who picks the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nAll the permutations and intrigues are coming just 6 days to the party\u2019s presidential primaries scheduled to hold May 29/30.\n\nPostponement\n\nAnnouncing the postponement in a statement Sunday night, APC National Publicity Secretary Barrister Felix Morka said a new date for the exercise would be announced shortly.\n\nIn a terse statement, the party said: \u201cThe Screening Exercise for Presidential Aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) earlier scheduled to be held on Monday, May 23rd, 2022, is hereby postponed. A new date for the exercise will be announced shortly. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.\u201d\n\nS/east, Bankole mull consensus\n\nAnd rising from its meeting Sunday in Abuja, presidential aspirants of the South-east extraction, expressed their readiness to back any of them chosen as a consensus aspirant.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued after the meeting held at Senator Rochas Okorocha\u2019s residence in Abuja, the APC presidential aspirants expressed their commitments to align with any of the South-east aspirants accepted by and chosen by other Nigerians to fly the APC flag.\n\nThe aspirants include; Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Senator Ken Nnamani, Barrister Uju Ken Ohanenye, Governor Dave Umahi, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba and Sen. Okorocha\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads: \u201cThat the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the All Progressives Congress and its National Working Committee as well as the teaming members of the party are commended by the entire people of the South-east on their avowed commitment to the unity of Nigeria and the inclusion of all parts of Nigeria in the governance architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cThat we commend all Nigerians who are committed to the Nigerian project by the whole hearted support of the aspiration of the South-east to produce the next Nigerian president in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat in furtherance of this commitment, all aspirants here commit to align with any of the South-east aspirants that is accepted by and chosen by other Nigerians to fly the APC flag.\u201d\n\n\u2026Bankole too\n\nTowing similar line, another presidential aspirant and former Speaker House of Representatives Bankole, called for the adoption of \u201cmodified consensus\u201d as the preferred method for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nAddressing newsmen Sunday in Abuja, the aspirant said, \u201cmodified consensus\u201d remained the best approach and least costly option for the emergence of the party\u2019s flag bearer.\n\nAccording to Bankole, the modified consensus option would see the leadership of the party engaging with the various interest groups in the contest to ensure a hitch-free nomination process.\n\n\u201cConsensus is not the same thing as imposition,\u201d Bankole declared, noting that the current opposition to the consensus arrangement in some quarters may be because \u201cconsensus is being erroneously equated with imposition.\u201d\n\nHe argued that there was a need to lay the anxieties of people currently opposed to the consensus arrangement to rest.\n\nBy embarking on widespread consultations with all interested groups and tendencies in the party, the leadership, he said, would allay all fears concerning the consensus option.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the APC itself was a product of consensus,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cat critical points in the history of Nigeria, consensus had been used to break political logjams.\u201d\n\nHe cited, in particular, the adoption of the \u201cDoctrine of Necessity\u201d during the illness of late President Umar Yar\u2019Adua as a perfect example of the consensus option.\n\nThe former lawmaker also added that the consensus option was adopted in the emergence of the current APC national chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nGiven the heightened national interest in the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate and frenetic jostling by various groups, Bankole averred that \u201cit is incumbent on the leadership of the party to adopt a method that ensures that the party can go to the 2023 elections as a united and formidable entity.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker concluded that he had \u201cimplicit and unalloyed\u201d confidence in the ability of the party leadership to do what is right towards ensuring a united front towards the elections and eventual victory at the 2023 polls.\n\nBuhari holds the ace \u2013 Zulum\n\nAlso weighing in on how best to produce the party\u2019s flag bearer, Governor Zulum said President Muhammadu Buhari would have the final say on who emerges the choice of the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nThe governor disclosed this Sunday in Maiduguri while receiving in audience the Rotimi Amaechi campaign team, led by its Director General, Senator Ali Ndume.\n\nAlso on the campaign team were a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Yusuf Buratai (retd.), and former Inspector-General of Police, Abba Suleiman among others.\n\nThe governor told the aspirant that Borno delegates had no preferred aspirant at the moment, adding however that the delegates would vote a credible candidate based on the preference of the president and their convictions.\n\nHe said: \u201cBorno state delegates will vote based on their conscience. But again, our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, is very important in this political equation. We are still waiting for him to tell us what to do and we will follow. His advice is very important so we have to wait for his advice.\n\n\u201cNigerians should pray for a good candidate to emerge irrespective of tribe, region or ethnic background; a candidate that will ensure the APC forms the central government come 2023.\u201d\n\nAddressing the delegates, Mr Amaechi urged the state delegates to support his aspiration so he could bring an end to insurgency and all forms of insecurity across the country.\n\nAmaechi said he brought about peace, safety, security and stability being enjoyed today in Rivers state as governor, assuring he would replicate same if allowed to fly the APC flag in the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former transport minister said: \u201cWhen I was governor of Rivers State, Buratai was a brigade commander while Abba Suleiman was the police commissioner. We ensured we engaged the teeming and idle youths by giving them jobs that kept them from the street. By so doing, we forestalled peace to the creeks in the state\u201d\n\n\u2018Osinbajo won\u2019t back down\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, The Progressive Project (TPP), the umbrella body of all groups canvassing support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to emerge as APC presidential candidate, has denied a viral video indicating that their principal was planning to step down for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIn the viral video released Sunday by one Daniel Bwala, an aide to the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, claimed that the VP was planning to concede to Asiwaju.\n\nBut reacting to the development through a statement made available to Blueprint and signed by the Director of Operations of TPP, Alhaji Usman Aliyu Usman, the body described the claim as false and \u201ca gutter fight which Osinbajo supporters cannot join.\u201d\n\nThe statement warned \u201cpaid agents\u201d to stop the spread of falsehoods against Vice President Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cOne of our visible supporters, Professor Olusola Adeyeye, a two-term Senator who represented Osun Central Senatorial District between 2011 to 2019 made some weighty statements about the APC presidential primaries on Saturday and by Sunday, really baseless and mischievous anti-Osinbajo statements began circulating.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, one of these came from Mr. Daniel Bwala, an aide to Deputy Senate President, Senator Omo-Agege who currently appears to moonlight as spokesman for the Bola Tinubu campaign.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, without any proof, Mr. Bwala started circulating a video clip with claims that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is \u2018allegedly planning to step down for Asiwaju\u2019; Mr. Bwala had no evidence and he ought to know better than going to town with such.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is still riding high in the race and our decision not to interfere in some camps\u2019 deliberate spread of illusion and untruths is only motivated by our genuine confidence in our candidate\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cAs stated long ago, no group linked to TPP will join any individual or group in playing gutter politics or smearing others but we need to unequivocally state that Professor Yemi Osinbajo is not contemplating any measure of capitulation to any candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile we are sworn to total allegiance to the Constitution, patriotic values and the spirit of good sportsmanship, we denounce the misleading information and unbecoming tricks that some supporters in other presidential candidates\u2019 camps embrace so eagerly.\n\n\u201cWe denounce too, the baseless ad unhelpful information being randomly disseminated by the likes of Mr. Bwala.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of the nation and its democracy, TPP appeals to all aspirants and supporters at all levels to learn from the focused and principled campaign methods of Professor Osinbajo and his supporters whose collective determination towards actualising Nigeria\u2019s enduring greatness is a cause that genuinely deserves the support of all patriots.\n\n\u201cWe categorically debunk the spate of falsehoods against PYO\u2019s candidature and we urge all Nigerian patriots to look forward to join us in the forthcoming celebrations on the day after APC presidential primaries,\u2019 the TPP official stated.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

A combination of both military and civilian misrule has brought the country to where we are currently are. If democracy had succeeded, we would not have banditry and insurgency in the north. We would not have unknown gunmen in the east. We will not have public officers conniving to steal N80 billion.\n\n\u201cWhat we are judging today is the failures and successes combined of previous administrations, but our fear today is that we should not topple the good we have earned and replace it with the one that we don\u2019t know that is coming\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the situation in the north, the retired general said: \u201cWe have created the insecurity we are facing in the north, based on the fact that we have not succeeded in creating those values that will inspire our growing population of poor and disadvantaged people.\n\n\u201cThe hopelessness is challenging and calls for objective and patriotic leadership and a change of mind. We should work for a system we can trust. A system that will be managed by people we can trust; a system that will enable us to trust one another because a better and united country starts with the people.\n\n\u201cOur children in the north don\u2019t seem to be ambitious. It is disappointing because 60 years ago or thereabouts, we had leaders who had ambition; leaders who wanted to free us through nationalism, from colonialism.

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "The Senator Representing Ekiti Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele has said loyalty to All Progressives Congress (APC) and his confidence in the ability and capacity of Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO) to provide responsible governance were the reasons he didn\u2019t challenge Oyebanji\u2019s victory in the January 27 primary election.\n\nSpeaking in Ado Ekiti on Friday as a Guest of Honour at an event organised by BAO\u2019s Anchor Organization to drum support for the APC gubernatorial candidate.\n\nIn his address at the event, MOB as he\u2019s fondly called said even though he contested in the primary, he had to embrace reconciliation as a loyal party member and work in the interest of the party the moment the winner had emerged.\n\nGoing down memory lane, Senator Bamidele reminded the crowd of favours the party had done him in the past, especially his emergence as Senatorial candidate in 2019 and the consensus agreement that has favoured him again to fly the party\u2019s flag for the Ekiti Central Senatorial seat in 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited today because our party is waxing stronger everyday. I\u2019m here not only as Senatorial candidate but as a loyal party man who also believe in the competence and capacity of Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji to provide good governance in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cOf course after the primary in January, many people thought we would challenge it in court but I knew that was not the way to go. I told my supporters that it\u2019s a family affair that must be treated within the family. I thank my brother, Governor John Kayode Fayemi, I thank the first lady and other leaders for the roles they played in making sure the family ties remain intact,\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the preparation of the party to win the June 18 election, Bamidele commended the various groups for their selfless sacrifice which made the event possible.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday is memorable in the history of our great party and the state because what is happening is a demonstration of the fact that politics has indeed gone back to the people. I\u2019m particularly excited because people have realized the need for participatory politics. I want to implore our people to move out and preach the gospel according to BAO for us to be victorious on June 18.\n\nEkiti State First Lady, Erelu Bisi Fayemi who spoke on the need for continuity at the event saluted all the support groups as well as the Women Campaign Council for their efforts towards BAO\u2019s victory in the coming governorship election.\n\nShe pointed out that continuity would lead to the retention of various laudable achievements of the outgoing administration.\n\n\u201cYou will all agree with me that Ekiti is not developing at the pace other developed states are developing. The reason is simple; there is no consistency in administrations as we see in Lagos and many other other states,\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Chairman of BAO Anchor Organization, Hon. Gbenga Agbeyo said the Anchor groups were committed to ensuring that total victory was record for the APC governorship candidate come June 18.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, a former APC State Chairman, Chief Jide Awe also admitted that there hasn\u2019t been anytime members of the public showed commitment to who governs them in Ekiti as being witnessed now.\n\nAwe called on APC leaders and members not to relent in their efforts at recording a landslide victory in the coming election.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji in his response thanked members of the BAO Anchor Organization for their support and promised to fulfil all his promises to Ekiti people if emerged as governor come June 18.\n\n\u201cI stand before you today that I will not disappoint you. That I will fulfil all my promises,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe governorship candidate, who restated his commitment to issue- based campaign, called on party members to refrain from any act of violence during the electioneering period. He said the record of performance of the APC- led administration in the state and the massive support of the people were enough to earn the party victory at the June 18 election.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to \u201cwidely publish the reports on the accounts and balance sheet of every political party submitted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the National Assembly since 2015.\u201d\n\nSERAP urged him to \u201curgently examine the books and records of financial transactions of political parties, and to make public the outcome of any such examination.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201cprovide details of the guidelines, and steps that INEC is taking to prevent vote buying in the forthcoming elections in Ekiti and Osun states and 2023 general elections, and to prosecute vote buyers and other electoral offenders.\u201d\n\nRecently, the All Progressives Congress (APC) collected N100 million for its presidential form while the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) collected N40 million for its presidential form for the 2023 election. Some leading political parties and politicians also spend between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes.https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#\n\nIn the letter dated 21 May, 2022 and signed by SERAP https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cNigerians have the right to know about the accounts and financial transactions of their political parties, especially the major parties with a strong possibility to assume government in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201ctransparency and accountability of political parties is important to achieve greater transparency in public life, curb the influence of money in politics, promote a level playing field, and remove the risks to the independence of political actors and would-be public office holders.\u201d\n\nSERAP also said, \u201cIt is both immoral and illegal to pay citizens to vote for a particular political party or candidate. Unpunished cases of vote buying and related electoral offences would continue to undermine good governance, the rule of law, moral values, as well as hinder citizens\u2019 participation in elections.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cWhen a political candidate decides to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidate will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote buying and related electoral offences encourage poor governance and weaken citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to urgently take measures and to collaborate with appropriate anti-corruption agencies to ensure the effective prosecution of any outstanding cases of vote buying and related electoral offences allegedly committed in the context of the 2019 general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of transparency and accountability in political finance is seriously undermining the legitimacy and credibility of the democratic and electoral processes, and invariably contributing to denying the citizens the right to effective participation in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure of political parties to comply with transparency and accountability frameworks would undermine citizens\u2019 trust in their political parties and lack of trust will inevitably destroy confidence in the system and decrease citizens\u2019 interest and participation in the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cElections are only one part of the democratic process, and a fair and effective electoral system must be founded in an adequate democratic infrastructure and responsibility of political leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, several political parties have for many years failed to submit their annual financial statements to INEC. Many political parties have failed to submit election expenses reports, and to disclose material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies to the Commission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also been apparently unable or unwilling to monitor, examine and publish these financial statements.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, some leading political parties, politicians and other political actors reportedly paid between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes. For many years, allegations of vote buying (the payment of cash or gifts in exchange for voting) and related electoral offences have characterised elections and party primaries in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that despite several provisions of the Electoral Act (as amended), anti-corruption laws, and the country\u2019s international anti-corruption obligations, suspected perpetrators of vote buying and related electoral offences frequently escape justice for their crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, INEC has consistently failed to exercise its powers and to provide the leadership that would promote collaboration with appropriate anti-corruption agencies to facilitate and ensure thorough, transparent and effective investigation of cases, and the arrest and prosecution of suspected perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 86(1) of the Electoral Act 2022 requires every political party to submit to INEC a detailed annual statement of assets and liabilities and analysis of its sources of funds and other assets and statement of its expenditure.

          "summary": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to \u201cwidely publish the reports on the accounts and balance sheet of every political party submitted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the National Assembly since 2015.\u201dSERAP urged him to \u201curgently examine the books and records of financial transactions of political parties, and to make public the outcome of any such examination.\u201dSERAP also urged him to \u201cprovide details of the guidelines, and steps that INEC is taking to prevent vote buying in the forthcoming elections in Ekiti and Osun states and 2023 general elections, and to prosecute vote buyers and other electoral offenders.\u201dRecently, the All Progressives Congress (APC) collected N100 million for its presidential form while the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) collected N40 million for its presidential form for the 2023 election.\nSome leading political parties and politicians also spend between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes.https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#In the letter dated 21 May, 2022 and signed by SERAP https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cNigerians have the right to know about the accounts and financial transactions of their political parties, especially the major parties with a strong possibility to assume government in the future.\u201dAccording to SERAP, \u201ctransparency and accountability of political parties is important to achieve greater transparency in public life, curb the influence of money in politics, promote a level playing field, and remove the risks to the independence of political actors and would-be public office holders.\u201dSERAP also said, \u201cIt is both immoral and illegal to pay citizens to vote for a particular political party or candidate.\nIf we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\u201cThe lack of transparency and accountability in political finance is seriously undermining the legitimacy and credibility of the democratic and electoral processes, and invariably contributing to denying the citizens the right to effective participation in their own government.\u201d\u201cThe failure of political parties to comply with transparency and accountability frameworks would undermine citizens\u2019 trust in their political parties and lack of trust will inevitably destroy confidence in the system and decrease citizens\u2019 interest and participation in the democratic process.\u201d\u201cElections are only one part of the democratic process, and a fair and effective electoral system must be founded in an adequate democratic infrastructure and responsibility of political leaders.\u201d\u201cAccording to our information, several political parties have for many years failed to submit their annual financial statements to INEC.\nMany political parties have failed to submit election expenses reports, and to disclose material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies to the Commission.\u201d\u201cThe Commission has also been apparently unable or unwilling to monitor, examine and publish these financial statements.\u201d\u201cAlso, some leading political parties, politicians and other political actors reportedly paid between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes.\nFailure to comply is an offence under Section 86(2), which is punishable by imprisonment for a term of six months or a fine of N1,000,000 or both.\u201d\u201cUnder Section 86(3)(4) INEC has the power to examine the records and audited accounts kept by any political party, and to publish the report on such examinations and audit in two national newspapers and Commission\u2019s website within 30 days of receipt of the results.\u201d\u201cSection 226 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022 also requires INEC to prepare and submit a report every year to the National Assembly on the accounts and balance sheet of every political party.",

President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman said the Kremlin had \u201cno information\u201d about this case.\n\nAt the time of the killing Shishimarin, 21, and other soldiers were travelling in a car they had seized after their convoy came under attack and they became separated from their unit.\n\nWhen they spotted Mr Shelipov he was speaking on his phone, Shishimarin told the court. He says he was told to shoot him with an assault rifle.\n\nHis defence lawyer told the court on Friday that Shishimarin had only fired after twice refusing to carry out the order to shoot and that only one out of three to four rounds had hit the target.\n\nHe said Shishimarin had fired the rounds out of fear for his own safety and he questioned whether the defendant had intended to kill.\n\nIn one dramatic moment during the trial, the victim\u2019s widow Kateryna Shelipova confronted Shishimarin. \u201cTell me please, why did you [Russians] come here? To protect us?\u201d she asked, citing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s justification for the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cProtect us from whom?

It trained 130,000 health workers. It provided social protection for about 30 million vulnerable households. It provided advisory support for 300,000 small and medium sized businesses.\u201d\n\nHe stated that to tackle the food crisis arising from the Russian-Ukraine crisis, the AfDB board last week approved a $1.5 billion African Emergency Food Production Facility to support 20 million farmers to produce 38 million metric tons of food.\n\nHe also said in a bid to help Africa adapt to climate change, the bank is partnering globally with the Global Center on Adaptation, and with former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to mobilize $25 billion in support of Africa.\n\nAdesina said, \u201cThe African Development Bank was ranked by Global Finance as the Best multilateral financial institution in the world in 2021. The African Development Fund was ranked by CGD as second best in the world, ahead of all 28 concessional financing institutions in developed countries.\n\n\u201cWe are a AAA-rated financial institution, the only one in Africa.

          "text": "Former banker and presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-deen, says he is in the race to change the character and complexion of Nigerian politics. Hayatu-deen said he was not a career politician, but only out to save the country from collapse, if elected president.\n\nHe made the assertions on Sunday in Lagos during an interactive session with media executives.\n\nHayatu-deen said as an economist he knew what was needed to kick-start the economy and ensure Nigerians smiled again.\n\nHe regretted the current killings in the country, saying it started in a part of Borno State, but has now enveloped the wh\n\nole North.\n\nThe aspirant added that bandits and ISWAP insurgents controlled areas about 40 kilometres outside major cities in the north. He lamented that Nigerians were only safer in the cities but in the villages, poor and vulnerable citizens, mainly children and women, were being killed.\n\nHayatu-deen said in the 80s and 90s, Nigerians used to shed tears whenever they heard that limbs were being cut in countries like Sierra Leone or when they heard about the genocide in Rwanda.\n\n\u201cBut today, we heard deaths in 50s and 60s, which is quite mind-boggling,\u201d he stated. \u201cThis is unacceptable and we have to deal with this.\u201d\n\nHayatu-deen added, \u201cAnd I can tell you that even if you increase the strength of the military by three, you will only be scratching the surface. We must not mistake the symptoms for the cause and that is why we have to look at the issue holistically and solve it once and for all.\u201d\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to successfully deal with insecurity, it would must create \u201ceconomic, social as well as gender security\u201d.\n\nHayatu-deen said, \u201cWe are a country of 210 million people and from global statistics, Nigeria is one of the highest growing countries in the world if not the highest growing.\u201d\n\nHe said there was nothing wrong with this if the country had the wherewithal to cater for the soaring population.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHigh population on its own is not bad as long as the country is ready to cater for the growing population. But the problem here is that we do not have any provision for these young Nigerians. As at now, we have over 170 million young Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe said there was a connection between insecurity and the growing army of able-bodied young men and women who were not adequately catered for.\n\nHayatu-deen also spoke on the question of gender security, saying, \u201cOur women are hardworking and doing a lot of things, both for the society and the family. We need to encourage them and ensure they reach their peak. That glass ceiling has to be broken and allow them to reach the top.\u201d\n\nOn his chances as an aspirant for the PDP presidential ticket, Hayatu-deen jokingly said he knew he was the rookie among the many career politicians jostling for the ticket. But he added that he drew inspiration from the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron, who, as investment banker, took the French political space by storm and won the presidency at less than 40 years of age.\n\nThe former managing director and chief executive officer of FSB International Bank believed a non-career politician could challenge the status quo and win. He said he was confident of victory in the race and equally sure of PDP\u2019s victory.\n\nHe then challenged the media to play its role and ensure that the best candidates emerged in both parties.\n\nHayatu-deen stated, \u201cThe media has a lot of role to play in sensitising delegates in both parties to ensure they pick the right candidates. You have to do this for us and ensure that Nigeria is rescued.\u201d\n\nHe said he would not accept any appointment even if his party won the election next year.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to help my nation. No one would accuse me of being a bystander and didn\u2019t join in trying to salvage the nation when it was burning. My father admonished me to see Nigeria as the centre of my universe and that is what it has been. I really love this nation,\u201d Hayatu-deen declared.",

          "title": "Presidential Race: Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amosun Not Suitable for Nigeria\u2019s Current Work Plan, Nwajiuba Says",
          "text": "With just a few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), presidential hopeful and former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has described the trio of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and Senator Ibikunle Amosun \u2013 all contenders for the APC ticket \u2013 as unsuitable for Nigeria\u2019s current work plan.\n\nNwajiuba, however, described the three contenders to the office of president as nice people. But he insisted that it made no sense for anyone from the South-west to be pitching for the presidency of the country now, after former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s eight years in office and Osinbajo about to serve out another eight years as vice president.\n\nThe former minister spoke exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential series interview.\n\nHe said former President of the Senate, Senator Ken Nnamani, and former Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, were patriotic Nigerians with good intentions, but maintained they were disadvantaged by their ages, as they were above 60 years.\n\nOn the question of zoning, which some have called an albatross in the party, Nwajiuba explained that it became difficult the moment everyone was allowed to purchase nomination forms.\n\nHe suggested that the reason bandits recently attacked a Kaduna bound train might be because they thought most of the passengers were delegates heading to Abuja to share from a dollar rain by aspirants, who had monetised the nomination process.\n\nAccording to the Imo State-born lawyer, who resigned his ministerial post to contest for the presidency, \u201cYou may be a smart person in the 60s, but the knowledge of economy has moved beyond your era. You might have governed Lagos State before, but those people you trained are also doing fantastic.\n\n\u201cThat, then, did not make the knowledge resident in only you. You could have great leaders like Asiwaju Tinubu or men like Ibikunle Amosun, even the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, who by their nature are very nice persons, they might not be suitable for the work plan now.\n\n\u201cThere are those, who mean well but being challenged by the age factor, like the former senate president, Ken Nnamani. He is a lovely person, who has the interest of Nigerians at heart, but he may not be as strong as he used to be when he was in government. So, you must excuse him.\n\n\u201cThe same thing applies to Ogbonnaya Onu, who also has the challenge of age. They are good men. We also have younger elements, like the governor of Kogi State, who, very agile in his 40s, but he has not garnered a nationalistic experience yet. He must be given room to grow.\n\n\u201cThere are many constraints for different aspirants. We need somebody, who has the empathy, the energy, the enthusiasm, and exact understanding of the experiences and knowledge that are required.\u201d\n\nStill on zoning and why some of his former colleagues in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet opted out of the presidential race, Nwajiuba said, \u201cYes, maybe because they did not study the time frame very well. I don\u2019t know whether they had certain other interpretations around it. Some may not have enough funds to pay for the forms.\n\n\u201cAbout 3,816 people contributed the money, which I used to buy my own form and I\u2019ve published their names. People contributed between N5, 000 and N500, 000 each within two weeks across the country. So, if we are going to build a consensus around the 24 aspirants, we will then talk about the location.\n\n\u201cNobody had zoned the positions before people started purchasing the forms. So, you cannot zone after they had purchased the forms. It is from the people, who are now available that you will look at what each aspirant is bringing to the table and how best would they solve Nigeria\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nNwajiuba, who defended the decision by some northerners to join the race, said, \u201cThere are three people from the north, who purchased the APC presidential forms: President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello; and Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Mohammed Badaru. They all have the right credentials to be Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cThey are men of foresight. They are from the North-east, North-central, and North-west. They are possibly in the contest to make a statement that if we are talking about national justice and fairness, we should only be thinking of the South-east. This is because it is the only zone in the south that has not produced president since 1999.\n\n\u201cHowever, for them to be seeing about eight people from the South-west suddenly laying claims to the same argument they had against the north makes it look very silly. This is because you cannot be accusing the north of something you are also perpetrating.\n\n\u201cOlusegun Obasanjo had been president for eight years; Osinbajo has been vice president since 2015. Why should the South-west say the north should cede power to the south and that they must be the beneficiary? How does that make any sense of any type?\n\n\u201cYet they are asking the young patriots in the north to cede power to them. I am sure if the South-west pulls out of the presidential race, aspirants from the north would also rest their ambitions and allow the South-east to produce Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\u201d\n\nAddressing allegations that he had not been going round to meet with delegates, probably, because he was complacent that Buhari already had his back, Nwajiuba said, \u201cMy job is how to organise the country. We have five delegates from each ward, including the chairman and the secretary. One of the remaining three delegates must be a woman. We were already a factor in every polling unit before the election started. That is how we think in modern times.\n\n\u201cIf you like buy two aircraft and be crisscrossing the country, once you leave your destination, other people will go and dine there. That is not how politics is done. We don\u2019t need to do dollar bazaar on the day of the presidential convention.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the bandits to come and attack us, like they did the last time, when they attacked the train going to Kaduna, because the bandits thought they were delegates, who had come to Abuja to collect dollars. If we insist on bringing everybody here and cause a naira rain in Abuja, how will the poor people survive?\u201d",
          "summary": "With just a few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), presidential hopeful and former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has described the trio of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and Senator Ibikunle Amosun \u2013 all contenders for the APC ticket \u2013 as unsuitable for Nigeria\u2019s current work plan.\nYou could have great leaders like Asiwaju Tinubu or men like Ibikunle Amosun, even the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, who by their nature are very nice persons, they might not be suitable for the work plan now.\n\u201cThere are those, who mean well but being challenged by the age factor, like the former senate president, Ken Nnamani.\n\u201cOlusegun Obasanjo had been president for eight years; Osinbajo has been vice president since 2015.\nWhy should the South-west say the north should cede power to the south and that they must be the beneficiary?",

          "text": "President Biden said the U.S. would get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if China tries to take it by force, issuing a stark warning to Beijing during his first trip to Asia as commander in chief.\n\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s the commitment we made,\u201d Mr. Biden said on Monday in response to a question from a reporter about whether he was willing to get involved militarily if Taiwan came under threat.\n\nMr. Biden stressed that the U.S. remains committed to the bedrock \u201cOne China policy,\u201d which recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the only legitimate government of China and acknowledges, but doesn\u2019t endorse, Beijing\u2019s claim that Taiwan is a part of China. But the president said that policy doesn\u2019t give China the right to forcefully take over Taiwan.\n\n\u201cWe agree with the One China policy and all the attendant agreements we made. But the idea that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, would just not be appropriate,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cIt would dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine. So, the burden is even stronger.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. president played down the possibility that China will try to take Taiwan.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that it will not happen,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding that it\u2019s important for world leaders to send a strong message that there will be consequences if Beijing takes such action.",
