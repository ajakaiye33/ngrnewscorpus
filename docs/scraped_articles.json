          "title": "Yobe youths embark on tree planting to address climate change",
          "text": "Youths in Yobe State have mobilised and embarked on a campaign to create awareness on the devastating effects of deforestation and the need to embark on tree planting as part of efforts to conserve and save the environment from further degradation arising from changing climatic conditions in the Sahara subregion which has led to declining food production, rainfall and increase in temperature in the State.\n\nThe youths who came together under the aegis of Youth For Nature on Friday in Damaturu said the state, more than ever, has witnessed a drastic reduction in rainfall this year which has affected farming thereby posing a threat to people\u2019s livelihood as the majority of residents who are predominantly farmers can not engage in farming activities due the insufficient rain and excess flood which ravaged the produce.\n\nSpeaking during the campaign, Ibrahim Inusa, a global ambassador for the environment and convener of the rally said the just-concluded global environmental convention that took place in Glasgow has tasked countries to either brace up to climate change or face the consequences.\n\nInusa said, \u201cThe rally is meant to bring to the fore the dangers of tree felling and the declining rainfall in parts of Yobe State and the Sub-Sahara region. As you must have noticed, over the past years, the rains have been reducing causing extreme heat and rising temperature. These factors have contributed to affect farming activities which is the predominant preoccupation of the residents of the state.\n\n\u201cYou will also agree that the use of trees for domestic purposes exposes the environment and the citizenry to health hazards. So we are campaigning to bring these dangers to public domain as well as promote the use of gas in homes. Ibrahim Inusa disclosed.\u201d\n\nAnother campaigner, Abubakar Muktar said that over two thousand seedlings have been made available for communities in some selected Local Government Areas prone to flood in Yobe South.\n\nHe stated the LGAs to include, Jakusko, Nguru, Postikum, Gashua and Fika.\n\n\u201cApart from these LGAs, we have also embarked on tree planting in houses and streets within major towns in Yobe State. The idea is that, since the majority of the population resides in these major towns and cities, there is a need to preserve these cities by ensuring trees are planted to provide a green environment. So in Damaturu and Postikum, we have embarked on a house to house tree planting. But the residents have to own the project and not see it as a government thing,\u201d Muktar said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nChairman/Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has charged 2,000 newly trained officers of the anti-narcotics body to resist every temptation that will make them compromise their duties and responsibilities.\n\nGen. Marwa gave the charge at the passing out parade of the new officers at the NDLEA Academy, Jos, Plateau state on Friday 19th November 2021.\n\nHe reminded them that they were coming into the Agency at a time when the institution is being overhauled to make it more effective and efficient, and as such their months of training at the Academy must count through impactful contributions to its goal of ridding Nigeria of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking.\n\nHis words, \u201cYou are coming into the Agency at an auspicious time when the management has pushed the reset button and commenced the overhaul of the old system and its encumbrances. Your employment coincides with a time we are putting in place all that is necessary to foster the enabling work environment that makes a career in the NDLEA gratifying.\n\n\u201cHaving been given the necessary training, we expect you to make your presence count with impact contributions to the achievement of the Agency\u2019s objectives in its campaign against abuse and trafficking of illicit substances. Qualities such as loyalty, discipline and diligence would help you to have a fulfilling career in a paramilitary organisation such as NDLEA.\n\n\u201cLet me also bring to your awareness how important you are now to society. Only very few occupations afford an individual the opportunity of direct, meaningful impact on society\u2019s wellbeing. You are part of a community of custodians who are assigned the responsibility of safeguarding society\u2019s sanity and safety against the corrosion of illicit substances. And today, I charge you thus: do not disappoint the Agency, and the society at large, and more importantly, do not disappoint yourselves.\u201d\n\nWarning them that they would be faced with temptations from the dark world of drug barons and their cartels, Gen. Marwa said the new officers and their senior compatriots must remain upright and patriotic always.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will not downplay the fact that the world of illicit drugs is a dark, dangerous underworld that must be met with uprightness, patriotism and strong will. That is why we are working purposely to put in place a welfare package that will shield you from circumstances or conditions that may predispose you to compromise your duties and responsibilities.\n\n\u201cYour upbringing and the training you have undergone should imbue you with the moral fibre to withstand the lure of filthy lucre, which is the weapon of drug barons. In whatever circumstance you may find yourselves in the course of your careers, think first about the greater good. And always remember that traffickers, barons and cartels are opposing forces with whom you must not have any communion whatsoever. As you take the first major step as anti-narcotic agents, I wish you a successful, fulfilling career in the NDLEA.\u201d\n\nHe said the official passing out parade of Narcotic Officers Course 15, 2021, coming barely seven weeks after the passing out of Narcotic Assistants in September, is yet another phase in the rapid evolution of the NDLEA.\n\n\u201cIn the 32 years of this Agency, this is the largest Course ever for Assistant Superintendent of Narcotics (ASN) cadre and the first in seven years. Today, the fight against illicit drug production, trafficking and abuse is being reinforced with the addition of about 2,000 new officers into field operations, where you will be joining your compatriots across Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the leadership and staff of the Academy for doing a great job in the training of a such a number of officers and men, as well as other stakeholders who helped to make the exercise successful, Gen. Marwa noted that whatever transformation is happening in the Agency is made possible through the unflinching support of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cAt this time, let me seize this opportunity to appreciate President Muhammadu Buhari whose political will, support and encouragement to NDLEA have brought about the renaissance in the Agency today\u201d, he stated.\n\nThe ceremony was the highpoint of a weeklong visit to Plateau State by the NDLEA Chairman/CEO who had earlier held advocacy meetings and deliberations on the dangers of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking with the state governor, Simon Bako Lalong;\n\nFirst Class traditional rulers in the state led by HRM Da Jacob Gyang Buba; leaders of local communities and local government council chairmen; leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN and Council of Ulamas; leaders of road transport unions; heads of security agencies in the state and a broad spectrum of other stakeholders.\n\nHe had seized the opportunity of the meetings to appreciate their support for the NDLEA and called for more collaboration in the renewed fight to stamp out the twin evil of drug abuse and trafficking of illicit drugs from Nigeria.\n\nThe GOC 3 Division, Major Gen. IS Ali had seized the opportunity of the NDLEA chairman\u2019s visit to hand over to him 350kg of cannabis seized by soldiers of Operation Safe Heaven while the Commander of the 551 NAF Station, Air Commodore Bidemi Marquis expressed commitment to partner with the state Command of the Agency.\n\nThe colourful passing out parade was attended by eminent dignitaries from within and outside the state including Governor Simon Bako Lalong represented by his deputy, Prof Sonni Tyoden; Chairman, Senate Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Senator Hezekiah Dimka; Chairman, House Committee on Narcotic Drugs, Hon. Francis Ottah Agbo; top state officials and heads of other security agencies in the state, among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has intensified efforts at eliminating the menace of human trafficking and has consequently signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU with Niger Republic so as to strengthen bilateral cooperation in that regard.\n\nThe MoU which was signed in Abuja was facilitated by the Kingdom of Netherlands through the International Centre for Migration Policy Development ICMPD -an intergovernmental organization with 19-member states and which holds a United Nations UN Observer status.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps\u2019 bill set to move, place CCT under judicial supervision\n\nAt the event, Director, Consular and Legal Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amb. Bolaji Akinremi who represented the minister said both countries had for several years collaborated in fighting the menace, hence the need to formalize such arrangement to give it more bite.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population size has a lot of potential and also challenges. With its population of over 200 million, Nigeria is said to be a country of origin, transit and destination while Niger Republic is regarded as a country of transit.\n\n\u201cThis understanding will assist the two countries to frontally attack human trafficking\u201d.\n\nHead of Office, ICMPD in Nigeria and West Africa, Dr Mojisola Shodeinde said the agency looks forward to greater cooperation between both countries and the ICMPD in order to stamp out human trafficking.\n\nShe said the two countries have a lot to gain in combating human trafficking which she according to her has far-reaching security, economic and humanitarian implications.\n\nThe ICMPD head added that the MoU is to formalize and strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fight against human trafficking.\n\nAccording to her, the MoU was inspired by the need to foster operational corporation and establish a practical, flexible and tactical joint operation mechanism between and among key institutions of government led by the National Agency for the Fight against Trafficking in Persons and International Smuggling of Migrants (ANLTP-TIM) from the Niger side and the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) from the Nigerian side.\n\nDr Sodeinde noted that the MoU outlines the key areas of cooperation to guide the activities of the Joint Technical Working Group (JTWG) set-up for the joint implementation of its provision.\n\n\u201cThis initiative came as part of activities implemented by ICMPD within the framework of the project: \u2018Strengthening Cooperation between Nigeria and Niger on Trafficking in Persons\u2019 funded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The project will support the JTWG established within the framework of the MoU to identify and agree on some minimum standards pertaining to the management of cross border trafficking cases between Niger and Nigeria.\n\nRepresentative of the Nigerien Government, Ousmane Mamane who signed for his country said \u201cthe memorandum will allow us the better be able to proceed victims, arrest traffickers, dismantle trafficking networks and eradicate this phenomenon on a long term basis\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis will enable us to protect the fundamental human rights of women and children\u201d, he added.\n\nDirector General, National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons NAPTIP, Dr Fatima Waziri who signed for Nigeria noted that the MoU will ow formalize and deepen the existing relationship between both countries and will help them to better address issues.\n\n\u201cOur shared values of protecting human lives, peace and security should continue to be enhanced. Trafficking is pervasive in West Africa and Nigeria accounts for many of these acts being a country of origin, transit and destination while Niger is regarded as a country of transit\u201d, she stated.\n\nAccording to the NAPTIP DG, the porous border between both countries has made it possible for traffickers to carry out their nefarious activities but added that NAPTIP has established taskforce in some of the border line areas.\n\nA representative of the Kingdom of Netherlands noted that the signing of the MoU was an important milestone aimed at strengthening the cooperation between both countries.\n\n\u201cWe value the emphasis it places on countering trafficking in women and children who are the most vulnerable\u201d.\n\nThe International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) is an international organisation with 19 Member States. Active in more than 90 countries worldwide, it takes a regional approach in its work to create efficient cooperation and partnerships along migration routes. Its three-pillar approach to migration management \u2013 structurally linking research, migration dialogues and capacity building \u2013 contributes to better migration policy development worldwide.",

          "text": "Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja Friday dismissed a suit instituted against the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) on the monitoring of spending of the $300 million recovered from late former Head of State, General Sani Abacha.\n\nThe suit instituted by PPP Advisories, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre and Issa Shuaib was thrown out by the court on account that it had become statute-barred when filed, failure of the three plaintiffs to establish their legal entity and tendering of worthless documents to support the suit.\n\nJustice Ekwo, while delivering judgment in the suit, held that all public documents tendered by the plaintiffs were worthless because they ran foul of sections 102, 103, 104, and 105 of Evidence Act 2011.\n\nThe judge held that the plaintiffs failed to certify the public documents as required by law and that the failure to certify them was fatal to the case as they have become inadmissible in law.\n\nJustice Ekwo said the documents are worthless because no probative value could be ascribed to them and expunged them from the court records.\n\nThe federal government had in 2030 upon the repatriation of the $300 million to Nigeria from the United Kingdom announced that the money would be used to fund the completion of the Second Niger Bridge, the Abuja \u2013 Kano dualisation, and the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Expressway.\n\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria, the United States Government and the Bailiwick of Jersey then entered into a tripartite agreement for the implementation of the $ 300 million Abacha loot on the condition that the funds would be used as part of the funding for the completion of the Second Niger Bridge, the Abuja \u2013 Kano dualisation and the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Expressway.\n\nFlowing from the agreement, the Federal Government sent out an invitation for consultants to submit proposals to the Federal Ministry of Justice, whereupon, the claimant PPP Advisories Consortium was among the four prequalified firms among the 17 firms that responded to the request for prequalification.\n\nAfter the evaluation of the financial proposals of the four prequalified consultants, the claimants PPP ADVISORIES CONSORTIUM was disqualified on alleged deficiencies in the claims submitted for qualifications.\n\nThe disqualification was conveyed to the plaintiffs in a federal government letter of July 28, 2020.\n\nDissatisfied with the outcome, the claimants \u2013 PPP Advisories; Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Issa Shuaibu & Co (PPP Advisories Consortium) \u2013 approached the federal high court challenging the legality or otherwise of the Federal Government decision.\n\nListed as defendants in the writ of summons marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1449/2020 and dated November 3, 2020, are the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF); the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Justice and Solicitor General of the Federation\u2019 Mr. Dayo Apata, SAN, (sued as Chairman Ministerial Tenders Board) and the Bureau of Public Procurement.\n\nThe claimants through their counsel, Dr Daniel Bwala, urged the court to make an order setting aside the decision of the procurement panel adjudging it\u2019s Technical and Financial proposal as non-responsive.\n\nThey equally urged the court to make an order directing the defendants to issue a letter declaring them as the winning bidder, and invite them for negotiation, having achieved the highest score and therefore emerged the winner of the bid.\n\nHowever, in his final judgment, Justice Ekwo agreed with the defendants that the suit had become statute-barred having been instituted outside the three months stipulated by law.\n\nThe Judge rejected all the public documents tendered by the plaintiffs to establish the case because they were not certified as required by law.\n\nJustice Ekwo also held that the plaintiffs failed to establish that they were legally registered as required by law.\n\n\u201cI have said that the court in deciding the case will look into all issues raised and that the case of the plaintiffs must succeed on its own merit and not on the weakness or failure of the defendants.\n\n\u201cI can safely say at this point that I am unable to ascribe probative value to any of the documents tendered by the plaintiffs to establish this case.\n\n\u201d I find no merit in this case and for this reason, this suit is liable to be dismissed and I hereby dismiss it accordingly\u201d, Justice Ekwo said.",

We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. The Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nOn the recent removal of Nigeria from the watchlist of countries violating religious freedom, which Blinken said was \u201cbased on facts,\u201d Buhari expressed the country\u2019s appreciation, noting that there was freedom of worship in Nigeria, and no one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith.\n\nHe said education is a priority in the country, \u201cbecause when you educate a people, there are certain levels they will not fall below.\u201d\n\nThe president equally appreciated the US for allowing Nigeria to procure military hardware to fight terrorism in the country, and for the training given to the Nigerian military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilise the situation in the North East, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015. We are doing a lot on security, and the people involved appreciate our efforts.\u201d\n\nOn the development of democratic ethos, the president said Nigeria has adopted the American model, \u201chook, line, and sinker, with its term limits. Those who have attempted to breach it were disappointed, if not disgraced. You are even lucky, if you have two terms. Others try hard and don\u2019t get it. The American model has been accepted by Nigerians as the best.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that Nigeria and her neighbours, have been living with the impact of climate change for a while, which has seen Lake Chad shrink drastically from its original size, and affected the livelihood of about 30 million people in the Lake Chad Basin countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why the youths defy the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to attempt emigrating to Europe. Inter-basin water transfer is needed to keep the youths at home, and they can resume their lives of farming, fishing, and animal husbandry,\u201d he said.\n\nBlinken, who had held a virtual meeting with the Nigerian President earlier in the year, said jocularly that it was now good to see him \u201cmask to mask, hoping we will soon see face to face.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the contributions of President Buhari to the protection of the climate, particularly his presence and contributions at the recent COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nBlinken said America and Nigeria have diverse challenges, but a common denominator is security, and hoped for better partnerships, \u201cso that the bad guys won\u2019t get the good guys.\u201d\n\nHe described the report of the EndSARS probe panel as \u201cdemocracy in action,\u201d stressing that America equally had its own police brutality and hoped that necessary reforms would be made.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The workers alleged that the NRC management had neglected their welfare over the years.\n\n\u201cIt is only in Nigeria you will see rail drivers drive train worth multi-billions naira and go home with N26,000 as salary every month. In other climes, railway workers are properly remunerated and their welfare are being taken care of,\u201d they alleged.\n\nNUR Secretary General, Segun Esan, said all the train stations across the nation were effectively shut down.\n\nHe said the affected rail stations include Lagos-Ibadan, Abuja-Kaduna, and Warri-Itakpe. He added that some notable routes also affected by the industrial action include Lagos-Kano, Kano-Unguru and Aba-Port Harcourt and other railway stations across the country.\n\n\u201cThis is first time in the history of railway service in Nigeria that all workers came out unanimously to demand their rights and to say to the management of NRC that enough is enough.

          "text": "*US seeks proper accountability of findings\n\n*Govt\u2019s lawyer disputes panel\u2019s leaked report, doubts casualty figures\n\n*Identifies 40 discrepancies in document, N800m spent on panel\u2019s 13 months sitting\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja, Nume Ekeghe and Wale Igbintade in Lagos in Lagos\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the federal government would not take any action to block or anticipate the outcomes of the various panels set up by state governments to investigate last year\u2019s #EndSARS protests.\n\nRather, Buhari said his government would wait to see the steps the governors would take before considering any action on the outcomes of the inquiries.\n\nThe nationwide protests in October last year had resulted in loss of lives and wanton destruction of property.\n\n\n\nBuhari, who spoke during a meeting with United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken,in Abuja, said his administration was inclined to allow the system work, and that the state governments would be required to take steps to address the issues raised in the panels\u2019 reports before the federal government would step in.\n\nBut the United States government, which has since shown interest in the #EndSARS matter, said it would like to see that both the federal and the Lagos State governments ensured that the report of the panel received due accountability and attention.\n\nHowever, counsel to the Lagos State government on the #EndSARS panel, Mr. Abiodun Owonikoko (SAN), has rejected the findings of the panel, which were leaked on Monday. Owonikoko also disputed the casualty figures recorded by the panel.\n\nHe claimed the leaked document was fraught with discrepancies and should not be in the public domain or be taken as an accurate document, especially, as one of the signatories to the document, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), was absent for the most part of the hearing.\n\nMeanwhile, sources close to Alausa, the seat of the Lagos State government, said the government spent N800 million to fund the #EndSARS inquiry, which lasted 13 months.\n\nBuhari was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, that, \u201cSo many state governments are involved, and have given different terms of reference to the probe panels.\n\n\u201cWe at the federal have to wait for the steps taken by the states, and we have to allow the system to work. We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. The federal government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nThe president told the US Secretary of State that his administration remained committed to freedom of worship, adding, \u201cNo one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith.\u201d\n\nHe expressed his appreciation to the US for the sale of weapons to Nigeria to fight insecurity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilise the situation in the North-east, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nBut Blinken, who spoke at a joint press conference with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at the State House, Abuja, charged the governments to see to it that the grievances of victims of security agents\u2019 brutality were attended.\n\nBlinken, who had held separate meetings with Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and Onyeama, during which some agreements were signed, also noted that his country was working with Nigeria to address its security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with Nigeria to address security challenges, including those posed by Boko Haram, ISIS West Africa and other terrorist and extremist groups. In meetings with the President, with the Vice President, with the foreign minister, we discussed the importance of a comprehensive approach that builds effective security forces, addresses the underlying drivers of extremism, and respects Nigerians\u2019 basic human rights.\n\n\u201cThe United States is committed to helping Nigeria do that by continuing to invest in our security partnership, and the institutions that strengthen the rule of law, and that hold accountable those, who commit human rights abuses, corruption and other acts that harm the Nigerian people. By tackling these issues, we can help to address some of the problems that have been key drivers of insecurity.\n\n\u201cTo that end, let me say that we welcome the conclusion of the investigation by the independent inquiry established by the Lagos State government to look into the events that took place at Lekki Tollgate in Lagos, in October of 2020, and this, of course, was amidst the #EndSARS protest, including the killings and other alleged abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate and look to the state and the federal government\u2019s response to the findings, and expect those to include steps that ensure accountability and address the grievances of the victims and their families.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also working closely with Nigeria to help the populations most affected by conflict and violence in the country, particularly in the Northeast, where the United States is providing vital humanitarian aid to approximately 2.2 million internally displaced Nigerians. United States continues to build the capacity, together with Nigeria, of the military, including through the recent delivery of 12 A29 Super Tucano aircrafts, but capacity building goes much deeper than delivering military hardware, something that we talked about as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also providing more human rights and rule of law training, because military and civilian security forces are more effective, when they act in accordance with these values. And because it\u2019s crucial that Nigeria holds accountable members of the military, who commit abuses,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to charge government to ensure the safety and wellbeing of groups involved in human rights advocacy, such as journalists, rights crusaders and others.\n\n\u201cJournalists, human rights defenders and others, Nigeria\u2019s very vibrant civil society are playing a vital role in shining a spotlight on these and other issues. Their ability to exercise freedom of expression and other basic human rights is crucial to advocating for individuals and communities and strengthening this country\u2019s vibrant democracy as we\u2019ve seen in the successful efforts to promote electoral reform, and lower the age at which Nigerians can run for office.\n\n\u201cI look very much forward to meeting several of these leaders tomorrow (today), including faith leaders, who are defusing communal tensions, and promoting peace. And we look forward to Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest democracy joining the summit for democracy next month. All participants from government, civil society will make commitments to improve and strengthen democracy in our respective countries and strengthen the partnership among democratic nations.\n\n\u201cThe range of issues that we\u2019re working on together is vast, but given the interests we share, and the challenges we have in common, delivering for our people demands that we find ways to deepen our existing ties and partnerships even further. That\u2019s ultimately what this visit and the work that we\u2019re doing every single day, between our governments between our people is,that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking about partnering in various areas, he said besides the 7.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines recently delivered at no cost to Nigeria, more would be delivered before the end of the year, citing other areas of collaboration between the two countries.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, working together to beat back COVID-19 and to build back better as we address the devastating impact that it\u2019s had on all of us, on our communities, on our economies. The United States has delivered 7.6 million doses of safe, effective vaccines to Nigeria, and we expect to send another significant number of doses by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cDonated with no strings attached. And we\u2019re providing significant aid to save lives right now. From the more than 150 testing labs that we have to set up nationwide to helping tackle food security crisis that was worsened by the pandemic. We have teamed up for a long time to confront epidemics and to improve public health. In that sense, this is not new.\n\n\u201cThe United States and others work with Nigeria toward eliminating a wild polio virus, supporting vaccination campaigns, aiding surveillance to detect and isolate cases. That collaboration was key to the country being certified free of the virus in August of 2020. That\u2019s a huge achievement. Reckon assistance is helping to bring treatment to more than one and a half million people in Nigeria living with HIV AIDS, and we\u2019re on track for epidemic control by 2023.\n\n\u201cOur support for primary health care helps provide vital services to more than 60 million Nigerians. These other and efforts have helped create a robust infrastructure for Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response and broader efforts to strengthen public health security, which are essential to detect and prevent the next pandemic.\n\n\u201cSecond, we\u2019re working with Nigeria to build back better from the pandemic by fostering inclusive sustainable economic growth. That\u2019s the goal of the 2 billion development agreement that Jeffrey and I just signed, and which will make I think, significant investments in improving access to quality education, public health and other services and tools that Nigeria\u2019s rising generations are looking for, and need to thrive here at home and in the global economy. And we\u2019re committed to working with the government as it pursues economic reforms, for example, to create a more stable regulatory environment to attract more foreign investment.\n\n\u201cThird, working together to address the global climate crisis. Foreign Minister and I were both just at COP 26, where President Buhari made significant new commitments to join the global methane pledge and build on the progress that Nigeria has made in solar power.\n\n\u201cThis is crucial as more and more Germans feel the impact of the crisis, something the President, I must say, talked about very eloquently, when we were together a short while ago, and displaced people, who have lost connections with their livelihoods as a result of climate change among other disruptions.\n\n\u201cOur work together also demonstrates how tackling this crisis represents an opportunity, our once in a generation opportunity to create good paying jobs and expand renewable energy access.\n\n\u201cThe USAID has a five-year $110 million project, the Nigeria power sector programme, and that\u2019s supporting key initiatives like the solar power major, which will bring solar energy to 25 million Nigerians, who are off the electric grid and lack access to power.\n\n\u201cThat, in turn, is expected to create as many as 250,000 new jobs in the energy sector, spur local industry, generate 18 and a half million dollars in annual tax revenues. So, it will have practical, meaningful effects,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe also expressed the United States\u2019 displeasure at the turn of events in Sudan, saying, \u201cLet me just say one brief word about yesterday\u2019s events in Sudan. The United States is deeply concerned by the violence used by the Sudanese military against people engaged in peaceful protest, which reportedly killed more than a dozen civilians and wounded scores more.\n\n\u201cThe military must respect the rights of civilians to assemble peacefully and express their views. And we continue to support the demand of the Sudanese people for the restoration of the civilian-led transition, and including the return of Prime Minister, Abdala Hamdok, back to office and the immediate release of all those detained since October 25,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Owonikoko, who spoke on the ARISE News Morning Show, a breakfast programme yesterday, stated that from the evidence gathered, there was no record of a single death.\n\n\u201cI am totally shocked about what I read to be in the report, particularly, the findings with regard to 48 victims some of whom are described as deceased and missing,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHe explained that it was unacceptable for a member of the panel to publicly disclose the contents of the panel\u2019s report, insisting that the panellists took an oath of fidelity with respect to impartiality and confidentiality.\n\nAccording to Owonikoko, \u201cIf anybody, who was a panel member has gone out as of today to speak to what has happened, that person has breached not only the oath he took to be a member, he has also breached the duty imposed on him not to discuss or divulge the contents to anybody. What we should be discussing, and this is very important, will be the government\u2019s own outcome. That outcome can be criticised.\u201d\n\nHe added that the panel comprised mostly people with no legal background, and this accounted for most of the alleged breaches of the law by members.\n\nOwonikoko alleged that there were at least 40 discrepancies in the report released by the panel, concluding that the members did not do a thorough job.\n\nHe stated, \u201cA number of them were not lawyers. And that, to me, actually, is the crux of the problem we have with this report. From the evidence that we were able to gather at the hearing, there was not a single death that was established.\n\n\u201cThe mistake I have observed is that the government made it in such a way that it should have been a different panel entirely to look into the Lekki incidents. The panel that was considered originally was meant to address victims of abuse of police brutality and SARS. So, from the very beginning, that panel lacked the judicial competency to determine these issues.\u201d\n\nOwonikoko stated that Adegboruwa, who was the representative of the civil society on the panel, had recused himself long before the report came out and had not been in most of the panel meetings. He urged that the report should not be considered valid.\n\nOwonikoko stated, \u201cThat report is already tainted and I would not expect the government not to be cautious in implementing that kind of report. I want to know how that gentleman (Adegboruwa) was able to sign off on this report as an objective and neutral report of facts that you are trying to find. He ought not to participate, because in this report, for almost 15 sittings, he did not come.\u201d\n\nInsisting that the report was not against the Lagos State government as such, Owonikoko stated that the only part that concerned the government was whether it ordered the deployment of soldiers. He also pointed out that during the entire proceedings of the panel, there was no evidence that the army was deployed by the governor, noting that ordinarily, the report would be subjected to a judicial review.\n\nThe lawyer explained that part of the discrepancies in the report was that even someone, who allegedly testified before the panel, was declared dead in the report. He said the discrepancies did not project the panel as having done a thorough job, expressing shock that such report should be released in the public space.\n\nOwonikoko explained, \u201cI have read the report. Since you now confirm that it is supposed to be authentic, I have identified almost 40 discrepancies, very material discrepancies in that report, including awarding damages to people, who are claimed to have died.\n\n\u201cPeople, who never died, who have even come out to say they did not die, including awarding damages to somebody they claim died but who actually was a witness to testify as to his brother\u2019s death not even at Lekki toll gate.\n\n\u201cDoes that not show you that there was no thorough job done? How do you make that kind of serious mistake, to award millions and millions to somebody claiming that he died when actually he was even a witness before you?\n\n\u201cIn the report itself, you will find where the witness was there and they recorded his evidence, and in the list they posted, they said he died and awarded him N15 million. What kind of report is that? That alone, any report that has that fundamental error will be crushed.\u201d\n\nDrawing a convergence between the Justice Oputa panel and the Okuwobi panel, Owonikoko argued that even if a white paper was released on the matter, it was not binding on anybody.\n\nHe stated, \u201cYou are entitled to subject it to the judicial review in a court of law. An instance that you may readily recall was the Oputa panel. One of the reasons a number of the recommendations did not see the light of day was that it was challenged in court and the Supreme Court held that some of the matters that the panel looked into, as much as the public was interested in knowing the truth about them, were beyond the remit of the federal government to constitute a panel to look into.\n\n\u201cI am not speaking on a report that is validly published and which can be authenticated as the outcome of that judicial inquiry. Nevertheless, I can\u2019t pretend not to be aware that certain documents have been circulating in the social media and have been subject of comments and responses.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the report released to the public was even unsigned, adding that it might well be a minority report.\n\nEmphasising that he had issues with Adegboruwa, whom he said was consistently absent during Saturday sittings on the Lekki incident, Owonikoko noted that the civil society representative lacked the moral right to have signed the document.\n\n\u201cThis same gentleman (Olu-Adegboruwa) had no legal or moral right to sign the report but he did,\u201d Owonikoko said.\n\nThe Lagos State counsel further said there was no place in the report that mention was made of an attempt to attack a traditional ruler and raze down Oriental Hotel at Lekki by hoodlums during the protest.\n\nThe leaked report had noted that there was an \u201catrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting #EndSARS protesters, while sitting on the floor, waving the Nigerian flags, and singing the National Anthem, and therefore concluded that it amounted to a \u2018massacre\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt said the security forces killed some 11 protesters while over 40 were injured, contrary to claims by the army and the Lagos State government that protesters were not killed.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers actually shot blank and live bullets directly and pointedly into the midst of the protesters at the Lekki tollgate, with the deliberate intention to assault, maim and kill. The soldiers turned back ambulances that were invited to render first aid and assistance to the wounded protesters,\u201d the report read.\n\nThe leaked report further stated that there were attempts to cover-up the killings, including soldiers picking up bullet shells on the night of October 20, 2020 and policemen following up in the morning of October 21 to pick bullet shells. It added that that LCC officials manipulated the CCTV cameras.\n\nBut the army had claimed that soldiers deployed to the Lekki tollgate only shot blank bullets into the air and operated within the rules of engagement. Lagos State Government is yet to officially react to the report, but it said the state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, invited soldiers to the scene.\n\nAdegboruwa: Lagos Govt Sponsoring Smear Campaign Against Panel Members\n\nIn the meantime, a member of the #EndSARS panel, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, has accused the Lagos State government of sponsoring a smear campaign against members of the panel.\n\nAdegboruwa, in a statement, said since the submission of the #EndSARS panel report to the governor of Lagos State on November 15, members of the panel had become the subject of vicious attacks by those suspected to be agents of the government.\n\nAdegboruwa accused the Lagos State government of unleashing mindless propaganda upon panel members, while at the same time asking for restraint from the general public.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cSince the submission of the EndSARS panel report to the governor of Lagos State on November 15, 2021, members of the panel have become subject of vicious attacks by those suspected to be agents of the government.\n\n\u201cAll manner of allegations have been heaped upon panel members, some of who have been called unprintable names. I can confirm that no member of the panel lobbied to be appointed into the panel.\n\n\u201cAs a matter fact, in my own case, His Excellency, the Governor of Lagos State, appealed to me to accept my appointment, which I saw as a call to national service. The primary reason the governor gave to me then was that he wanted men and women of integrity, independent and not subject to manipulation, to be on the Panel.\n\n\u201cJust today, my attention has been drawn to an interview by a Senior Counsel to the Lagos State government, to the effect that panel members collected bribe in the course of the assignment. It is unfair, ungodly and least expected of the government and its lawyers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lagos State Government asked for two weeks to enable it release a White Paper on the report submitted to it by the panel. And we have been waiting, but it would seem that the Lagos State Government has now unleashed mindless propaganda upon panel members whilst at the same time asking for restraint from the general public.\n\n\u201cI have in my custody, certified true copies of ALL proceedings of the panel and all exhibits tendered before the panel in respect of the Lekki Toll Gate Investigation. I urge the government to call its agents and lawyers to order so as not to provoke aggravated responses\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair to seek to denigrate peoples\u2019 hard-earned reputation on account only that they accepted to render selfless service at the behest of government. If the government and its agents are not restrained from attacking others, nothing stops us from defending our integrity.\n\n\u201cI should not become a victim of unwarranted attack just because I accepted to serve the government and the outcome of that assignment did not favour the expectations of the government. Suffice it to mention that I worked with men and women of unblemished integrity and I\u2019m proud to be associated with them all.\u201d\n\nAdegboruwa, therefore, urged the Lagos State government to keep its promise to release a White Paper on the inquiry report within two weeks, and \u201csend the unedited report of the panel, to the National Economic Council.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) yesterday revealed that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.03 per cent in the third quarter (Q3) of 2021, compared with the 5. 01 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter of same year.\n\nThe Statistician General of the Federation (SGF)/Chief Executive, NBS, Dr. Simon Harry, who revealed this at a media briefing, said the negative impact of the COVID-19 continued to impact on economic performance.\n\nHe said despite the slower growth, the Q3 performance was considered a tremendous improvement over both Q1 and Q2 of the year, adding that there had been steady growth of the economy.\n\nIn nominal terms, aggregate GDP increased to N45.11 trillion in the period under review, compared with the N39.12 trillion recorded in Q2 and N39.09 trillion in Q3 2020.\n\nIn the same vein, real GDP which shows volume of economic activities, stood at N18.54 trillion, higher by N1.85 trillion compared to N16.69 trillion in Q2 as well as higher by N718.57 billion when compared to N17.82 trillion recorded in the corresponding quarter of last year.\n\nThe economy was largely driven by the non-oil sector which accounted for 92.51per cent of GDP, while the oil sector contributed 7.49 per cent to growth in Q3.\n\nDaily oil production averaged 1.57 million barrels per day (mbpd) compared to 1.61mbpd in Q2 and 1.67mbpd in Q3 2020.\n\nOil growth rate stood at -10.73 per cent in real terms in the review period.\n\nThe SGF explained that the negative GDP figures recorded in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had serious base effects on output figures for Q2 and Q3.\n\nHarry said: \u201cI must state that the improvement being seen in the output growth over the last four quarters depicts a steady progress made in stemming the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated negative impact on livelihood, well-being, and the economy.\n\n\u201cGlobally, many countries have witnessed an improvement in economic performances compared to 2020 when COVID-19 was endemic.\u201d\n\nHe said economic recovery remained a gradual process that requires consistent collective efforts to improve economic activities across the institutional sectors.\n\nHe explained: \u201cHowever, in Nigeria the prospect of full recovery is glaring provided the current trend of improved economic performance is sustained in the rest of the year and beyond.\u201d\n\nAgriculture contributed 29.94 per cent to real GDP, higher than the 23.78 per cent recorded in Q2 while manufacturing accounted 8.96 per cent higher than the 8.69 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter.\n\nAlso, trade contributed 14.93 per cent to GDP, lower than the 16.66 per cent recorded in Q2.\n\n\u201cYou might be looking at the 5.01 per cent as being higher than the 4.03 per cent but when you look at the base effects, you discover that the margin between the two, certainly that of the third quarter was a higher figure compared to the 5.01 per cent as released in the second quarter of the year,\u201d the SGF added.\n\nHe insisted the economy was growing rather than declining.\n\n\u201cThere was serious base effects affecting the figure because Q3 2020 recorded negative rate while Q2 2020 recorded negative rate. And so if you consider the margin between the two figures, you will discover that the economy certainly is growing rather than decreasing. It is the base figures that have influenced the figure for this year,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, reacting to the GDP numbers, analysts have urged the federal government to deepen its poverty alleviation programmes so that vulnerable Nigerians would feel its impact.\n\nThey also advised the government to initiate policies that could enhance real growth and, \u201cnot paper growth\u201d as well as curb the rising insecurity across the country.\n\nThe analysts who spoke in separate interviews with THISDAY, further advised the government to sustain current efforts at stimulating growth.\n\nManaging Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said the economic performance showed that the country was still growing, adding that the government should continue to maintain the growth trajectory.\n\n\u201cRecall that year on year measurement was involved in determining the GDP growth.\n\n\u201cAbout this time 2020, the COVID-9 restrictions eased off and businesses peaked again.\n\n\u201cSo whereas Q3 performance of 2021 grew year to date in real terms, the year on year comparison with Q2 of 2021 is expected to decline because of the base year effect,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Managing Director/Chief Executive, SD&D Capital Management Limited, Mr. Idakolo Gbolade, said the performance was as a result of the policies of the federal government currently being implemented by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nHe said the federal government needed to look inwards to create a conducive environment for the economy to thrive by curbing the rising cases of insecurity and ensure that the CBN maintains its interventions in foreign exchange to reduce cost of production.\n\nHe urged the government to deepen its poverty alleviation programmes so that it would reach the original beneficiaries in order to make real impact.\n\nGbolade said: \u201cThe maintenance of the MPR at 11.5 basis point caused the economy to witness a higher economic performance.\n\n\u201cHowever, the headwinds of continuous hike in cost of commodities coupled with the rising cost of cooking gas and impending hike in petrol prices are a major concerns.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*CBN processing N656bn bridge financing, to spread over six months\n\n*FG targets 50% COVID-19 vaccination, urges strict compliance to protocols ahead of yuletide\n\nObinna Chima\n\nAll of the 36 states in the country are expected to get N18.2 billion each from the fresh N656 billion bridge financing facility that has been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe fund is expected to help the state governments meet financial obligations, especially the previous budget support facility due for repayment.\n\nThis was disclosed yesterday at the National Executive Council\u2019s (NEC) 121st meeting (10th in 2021), which was held virtually and was presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, with state governors, Federal Ministers, the Central Bank Governor, and other senior government officials in attendance.\n\nAccordinf to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, the Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning, Dr Zainab Ahmed, informed the Council that the bridge facility was being processed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe fund would be disbursed in six tranches over a period of six months to the states.\n\nEach of the 36 states would have a total loan amount of N18.225 billion; with a 30-year tenor, and a 2-year moratorium at an interest rate of nine per cent.\n\n\u201cThe facility is to help the States afford the repayment of previous bailout facilities guaranteed for them by the federal government,\u201d it added.\n\nThe council had July 15th, 2021, received updates on the budget support facility to states. At that meeting, the Finance Minister had informed the council that the deductions from state governments would commence soon as repayment for the previous bailout from the CBN. Subsequently, the states sought further support leading to the idea of bridge financing.\n\nAhmed had on Monday disclosed that the president had approved the facility, saying it was meant to cushion the effects of their resumption in the repayment of the three federal government bailout facilities namely the Salary Bailout, Excess Crude facility and Budget Support facility.\n\n\u201cGovernment will also continue to provide other financing options to states in the form of concessionary loan facilities to support the development of vital sectors of the economy such as health, agriculture and SMEs aimed to complement the states in fighting the pandemic, creating the needed job for the people and alleviating poverty.\n\n\u201cThe combined effect of these policies would assist in addressing the current security and other socio-economic challenges confronting the nation,\u201d she had explained.\n\nAlso at yesterday\u2019s meeting, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning gave the Council an update on the Excess Crude Account which according to her stood at $60, 860,309.33 as of November 15th November; while the Stabilisation Account was N27,103,662,581.25 as of same date.\n\nSimilarly, Ahmed revealed that the balance of the Development of Natural Resources Account also stood at N60, 884,460,981.23 as of November 15th.\n\nFurthermore, the statement also revealed that during the NEC meeting, the Executive Director/CEO of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, informed the Council on the Status of the country\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine roll-out.\n\nShuaib noted that Nigeria had received over 100 million doses of COVID\u201319 vaccines (from COVAX, African Union, other countries) which he said was sufficient to ramp up vaccination for about 50 per cent of the targeted population.\n\nThe total eligible population of Nigerians for the vaccine was over 111 million, he added.\n\n\u201cGiven the availability of vaccines, we have started rolling out a plan to vaccinate 50 per cent of Nigerians, 18 years and above by January 31st, 2022,\u201d the NPHCDA DG said, adding that there would be a scaling up of over 3,000 health facilities nationwide.\n\nIn his presentation to the Council on states\u2019 performance report on COVID-19, the Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa said Nigerians must continue to maintain and sustain the COVID-19 response, especially as it enters the holiday period where there will be anticipated travels within and outside the country, as well as mass events to herald the holiday season.\n\nAdetifa said the country should \u201cmaintain visibility of the outbreak by testing, continuing to encourage adherence to public health and social measures, encourage vaccination and address vaccine hesitancy.\u201d\n\nThe DG, NCDC added that the Delta variant of the COVID-19 was still the dominant strain of concern in the country.\n\nAccording to Adetifa, the number of COVID-19 cases presently was 213,321; No of Cases tested \u2013 3,440,172; Active Cases -4,142; Discharged Cases \u2013 206,206 and number of deaths was put at 2,173\n\nThe council was informed on the global situation of Covid-19 with over 251 million cases and over five million deaths recorded.\n\nIn Nigeria, the NCDC boss revealed an increase in case fatality ratio (CFR) from 1.4 per cent in week 44 to 14.3 per cent in week 45. He said Lagos\u2019 contribution to caseload declined to 10 per cent, while Plateau\u2019s proportionate contribution increased.\n\n\u201cOver the last four weeks, weekly cases have been declining in 11 states, increasing across two states. Monthly detection of variants of concern in Nigeria: Delta strain is still dominant,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn terms of the current Cholera situation in the country, the NCDC boss put the suspected number of cases at 100,157 recorded in 32 states and the FCT, while the number of deaths was put at 3,449\n\n\u201cMulti-sectoral emergency operation centres activated at level 2 continues to coordinate the national response.

          "text": "*Declares indirect primaries have not helped the growth of democracy in the country\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nGovernors lobbying President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill may have lost out in the equation going by the disclosure from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday, that the president was in support of direct primaries for political parties to produce candidates for elections.\n\nThe Speaker, who spoke with journalists after meeting with the president at the State House, Abuja, said Buhari was a product of direct primaries, because of his popularity, adding that direct primaries open up the political space for the youths to participate.\n\nHe noted that the indirect primaries, which have been the practice in the selection of candidates for political parties for elections have not helped the growth of democracy in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, therefore, assured the people that the president would soon sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law since he was back from official engagements.\n\n\u201cThe President is happy. He will look at all the issues we have brought to his attention. We talked about the Electoral Act amendment. We talked about agricultural development and other issues. All of the issues, the President will look at them,\u201d the Speaker said.\n\nAsked to dwell on his discussion with the president, the Speaker retorted: \u201cSeveral issues, which one are you interested in? I will tell you whether it was part of it or not. Yes, the issue of national development and the synergy with the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis tripartite committee, if I tell you we didn\u2019t discuss the Electoral Act amendment, which is what I am sure you are asking about, I will be lying to you. We had a very robust discussion and our position is known to the president,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen further asked to state the official position of the National Assembly, Gbajabiamila said, \u201cAre you not aware that the National Assembly has passed the issue of direct primaries and electronic transmission of election results? That is the position of National Assembly. It has passed through both houses. We have passed the law. The official position of House of Representatives and the Senate, we are for direct primaries.\n\n\u201cWe are for empowering the people at the grassroots level. Let everybody participate in governance. Democracy is defined as government of the people, for the people and by the people. People is used three times in that definition. And it doesn\u2019t start from general election. It starts from primaries. So, we have made it very clear, abundantly.\u201d\n\nDefending direct primaries, said, \u201cIt has been like that for a long time and it\u2019s not helping our democracy. It is not growing and deepening our democracy. We have passed \u2018Not Too Young to Run Bill,\u2019 which the President was very happy to be a part of, because he wants to encourage young people. But it\u2019s just a bill on paper.\n\n\u201cYou pass Not Too Young to Run Bill, but at the same time you close the space for the young ones for whom you have passed Not Too Young to Run Bill.\n\n\u201cYou have continued with your indirect primaries, how will the young people get involved? Now, they have a chance with the direct primaries. You have opened up the space and they can get in and mobilise themselves and if they are popular enough, they win the election. They are not dependent on any godfather,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile reacting to the view expressed by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State that it would be too expensive for political parties and INEC to handle direct primaries, he said,\u201dHere is what I have to say. I have heard that argument about cost. And this is what I have to say.\n\n\u201cDo you put a price tag to democracy? I don\u2019t think you should. What is too much and what is too little to buy freedom and democracy? I don\u2019t think you should put a price tag to it. So, how much will be okay for him? He should tell us how much will be okay for him.\u201d\n\nOn the concern that the National Assembly was fighting, because they had been edged out, he said: \u201cLet me tell you something very clearly, and I have said it over and over again, the indirect primary is easier for me, at least, as far as my constituency is concerned.\n\n\u201cThe indirect primary is easier for me. But because I don\u2019t want to be selfish, because I want to look at the bigger picture, I will rather go with direct primaries. Let everybody go and vote. If they vote me out, they vote me out. It is as simple as that.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Electoral Act Amendment Bill had been transmitted to the President and when it would be assented to, the speaker said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the way. You can be sure of that.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the takeaways from his discussions with the president, Gbajabiamila said: \u201cVery good, hopefully, we get the bill transmitted now that he is back very soon. We are hopeful it will become law and Nigerians will be better for it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the reason for the visit to the State House, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the president in a while. The president has been out of the country doing Nigeria\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cHe attended Climate Conference and he was in South Africa for the Trade Conference. He was also in Paris. I just came to brief the President as to the goings on in the country as it affects the National Assembly. So, we had fruitful discussions.\n\n\u201cWe have been here for a while. We had fruitful discussions and tried to strike some synergy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INSIDE STORY: The Kwara communities where toilets are luxury and open defecation is a norm",
          "text": "In the middle of the night when Halimat Abbas, a 33-year-old mother of three, gets pressed, she would get up and make for the dumpsite behind her house in the Gambari area of Ilorin East LGA, Kwara state. For her children, the eldest just six years old, there is a small-sized paint bucket that serves as the makeshift toilet. By morning, Abbas empties the bucket of poop and urine, of course, at the dumpsite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Abbas, it\u2019s the same routine for other mothers who reside in the 10-room \u2018face-me-I-face-you'(single room) apartment. With zero urban planning, houses, mostly of the \u2018face-me-I-face-you\u2019 pattern, are built in a disorganised manner with barely enough space for movement from one house to the other, and out of the area. Outside the house, residents and passersby have to walk gingerly while making their way through the access paths so as to avoid making contact with wraps of poop.\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t like using the dumpsite excrete inside wraps of nylon, and throw out through their windows onto that path where people walk through,\u201d Abass said.\n\n\u201cSome of the wraps of poop could be there for weeks until we get tired of the smell and then we go and clean it up. But this only lasts just a few moments before everywhere is littered again,\u201d she lamented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMOST HOUSES ARE WITHOUT TOILET\n\nThe expansive dumpsite behind Abass\u2019 house serves over 100 households in the area. Abbas, who has lived in the area for about 10 years, explained how the one-time small heap of dirt and poop gradually rose to a huge dumpsite, fuelled by the fact that most houses lack sewage facilities.\n\n\u201cOf about 100 houses here, you will hardly see 10 that have toilets,\u201d said Lukman Ahmed, another resident whose house is within close proximity to the dumpsite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany years ago when most of the houses in the area were under construction, Ahmed said their great grandfathers didn\u2019t think about toilets.\n\n\u201cWe live in these houses now, so, where do you want us to use as toilets? That is why any available space here, people, over the years, quickly make use of to dispose of their poop and other wastes.\u201d\n\nIn the recent past, the state government made provisions for sewage collection from these households, but residents said this had since stopped. Some, however, blamed it on the fact that most of the houses are not accessible for sewage trucks provided by the government.\n\n\u201cThe houses were built without a standard layout, and there\u2019s no road for cars or even trucks to get to some of these houses,\u201d Ahmed added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the edge of the dumpsite is a tent where children from the neighbourhood gather in the evening for Quranic lessons. Despite the stench of feces \u2014 so bad that it could provoke puking \u2013, the children appeared unbothered as they chanted loudly in Arabic, effusively and almost in competition with each other. When thirsty, or in need of water for ablution, the only source available to the children is the well dug on the fringes of the dumpsite.\n\nAbdullahi Ambali, the mualim(teacher) on whose house the tent for the Arabic class rests, is worried, especially about the safety of the children that gather around him every evening. On Sundays, he would ask his students and other young people in the area to help clear the site, at least the part closer to where the lessons hold.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do this, the whole place would have been overwhelmed. Take a look at the dumpsite, it is now as high as the storey buildings around it,\u201d the mualim said.\n\nUnlike other residents, Ambali has constructed a latrine in his house for his use, and the use of his students. He wishes other residents could do the same, and just maybe, they could move an inch closer to a hygienic environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABANDONED LATRINES\u2026 UNCOMPLETED BUILDINGS\n\nOn the other side of Gambari is the Okelele community where most of the \u2018face-me-I-face-you\u2019 houses are also without toilets. Years ago, residents had put resources together to construct latrines, each strategically positioned to serve at least 50 nearby households. They initially contended with the problem of space to dig the pits, but some houses with bigger yards eventually yielded a portion of their lands for the latrines. The latrines, however, barely functioned for two years, and residents had since returned to open defecation.\n\nLack of cooperation among most of the households, Yakubu Ganiyu, one of the residents, said led to the rot of the latrines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe explained that \u201ceach household was billed N200 monthly for maintenance, but it got to a point that people stopped paying\u201d. Before now, the contributed sum was mainly used in hiring sewage disposal trucks that emptied the latrine pits on a monthly basis.\n\n\u201cSome of us are worried, and because we can\u2019t pull all the resources alone to hire sewage disposal trucks, we started burning the things off, and we could only do that for a short while,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother preferred location for open defecation is uncompleted buildings. For those whose houses are within range, as soon as they are done wrapping their poop in nylon, they fling it into the uncompleted building\u2013 a popular act referred to as \u2018shotput\u2019. From the artisan heading back from work to the commercial motorcycle rider on duty, the uncompleted building serves as an emergency restroom should the need arise.\n\nDRAINAGE TURNED COMMUNITY TOILET\n\nAlthough there is a signboard warning against defecation in the drainage in the Amule area and neighbouring communities, residents seem not to care. Almost everyone whose house is within close proximity to the drainage has turned it into a toilet.\n\nLetting out a smile, Asmiyu Biliamin, a trader and resident in Amule, said: \u201cWe are lucky to have this drainage pass by our backyard.\u201d\n\nFrom morning till evening, residents, mostly children, can be seen bending at the edge of the drainage and discharging their feces. Worse still, some of the residents have used zinc to construct open roof toilets, passing the pipes directly into the drainage.\n\n\u201cBut what do you want us to do when we don\u2019t have toilets? Should we kill ourselves? Even the government knows there is nothing they can do to us,\u201d Biliamin retorted when shown the warning on the signboard.\n\n\u201cIn all of this area, this drainage is our toilet, we don\u2019t have anywhere to go. If any government is going to arrest us, it should first build us toilets,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the same vein as Billiamin, other residents accused the government of not providing them with public toilets and waste disposal tanks, and this had left them with no option than to turn to the drainage when nature comes calling.\n\nCLASSROOM SHUT DOWN OVER \u2018POOP SMELL\u2019\n\nThe environmental pollution is becoming unbearable for pupils and teachers of the secondary school in Amule, which also sits close to the drainage. The fence of the school named after Bukola Saraki, a former governor of the state, is weakened and falling apart, consequently, exposing some of the classrooms to the feces-littered drainage.\n\nThe school says it has been calling on the government for help, but no succour has been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cIt is a terrible smell\u2026 both teachers and pupils find it difficult to stay inside the classrooms,\u201d one of the teachers said.\n\n\u201cWe had to shut down one of the classes because the smell was too much to bear. We have written a series of letters calling for assistance. Sadly, too, we\u2019ve not had a functioning toilet for our students since the one here got bad.\u201d\n\n\u2018RESIDENTS PRONE TO DIARRHEA, CHOLERA\u2019\n\nThe major source of water in most of the communities visited by TheCable are wells. Samples taken from some wells across the communities were subjected to laboratory tests and analyses, and it was found that residents who use the water are prone to diseases like cholera.\n\nNitrate, a compound that is formed when nitrogen combines with oxygen or ozone, was seen in quantities that could cause \u201cblue baby disease in infants under three months old\u201d.\n\nFilterable solids were also found in quantities that could cause \u201cgastrointestinal disorder\u201d in the residents.\n\nAsides from cholera, microbial analysis of samples collected showed that residents are also prone to diarrhea, dysentery, and jaundice.\n\nKWARA: WE\u2019LL START ENFORCING ANTI-OPEN DEFECATION LAW\n\nIn a recent report by UNICEF and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the north-central ranks lowest of all geopolitical zones in the number of people using basic water supply, sanitation services.\n\nOut of the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT), Kwara ranks 36th, just a step above Ebonyi which sits at the bottom of the table. According to the report, Kwara ranks highest among states where open defecation is rampant in the country.\n\nKolawole Gabriel Towoju, a director at the state\u2019s ministry of environment, said Kwara\u2019s ranking in the report was inaccurate.\n\nHe said since 2018/2019, the government has embarked on \u201coperation Free Kwara by constructing three complexes of public toilets with borehole and a solar panel to power the public toilets\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, these toilets are located in select areas of Ilorin, the state capital.\n\n\u201cWe have one at Ambere, Poly School, Garage Offa, and if not for COVID-19 that came with economic meltdown, maybe we would have constructed more integrated public toilets,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government is also working on an allocation of about 1,000 public toilets to be located across the three senatorial districts of the state.\n\nAs for those still engaging in open defecation, Towoju said it is time \u201cthe government starts to enforce its environmental law which prohibits such acts\u201d.\n\nEVEN THE MINISTRY\u2019S TOILETS HAVE NO RUNNING WATER\n\nTheCable also observed that the toilets at the state\u2019s ministry of the environment were without water.\n\nMost of the staff who need to use the toilet would have to get water from a tank within the premises.\n\n\u201cHow do we even solve toilets issues for other people when we have not sorted the ones here at the ministry?\u201d a member of staff who doesn\u2019t want to be named remarked.\n\nHUNDREDS OF MILLIONS APPROVED FOR PUBLIC TOILETS\n\nChecks by TheCable showed that in the 2020 budget, the state government had approved N140 million for the purchase of \u201cwaste management\u201d trucks. In 2019, the government had approved N202 million for the same purpose.\n\nAlso, in 2020, the state government budgeted N200 million for the construction of public toilets, and N5.2 million for the rehabilitation of public toilets.\n\n\u2018GOVERNMENT NOT DOING ENOUGH\u2019\n\nMusa Aliyu, executive director of Media Advocacy and Technology Center, a civil society organisation based in Ilorin, told TheCable that the Kwara state government is not doing enough to address the issue of open defecation.\n\nAliyu said it is unfortunate that UNICEF\u2019s report, which was based on a national health survey, puts Kwara state as one of the topmost states as far as the issue of open defecation is concerned.\n\n\u201cGovernment is not showing enough commitment as far as the issue of open defecation in Kwara state is concerned. The communities, too, are not aware of the danger they are putting themselves into,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the issue of water, hygiene and sanitation, I want to tell you that the majority of government\u2019s policies and programmes tend to neglect this sector because they believe it\u2019s not a strong sector like education and the rest.\n\n\u201cSo you discover that the budgetary provision for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) in a state like Kwara has not been found to have any meaningful impact on the communities.\n\n\u201cThe blame for the open defecation still goes to the government. Is there any serious policy on open defecation? How seriously is the state taking WASH? Are there lineups of programmes to sensitise these people in the communities?\u201d\n\nAliyu advised that the government should pump in more resources into WASH, and create a loan facility for some residents to construct toilets in their areas. But before that may happen, residents of the state who lack hygienic alternatives will continue to discharge feces indiscriminately, endangering themselves and others.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation.

          "text": "In the middle of the night when Halimat Abbas, a 33-year-old mother of three, gets pressed, she would get up and make for the dumpsite behind her house in the Gambari area of Ilorin East LGA, Kwara state. For her children, the eldest just six years old, there is a small-sized paint bucket that serves as the makeshift toilet. By morning, Abbas empties the bucket of poop and urine, of course, at the dumpsite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Abbas, it\u2019s the same routine for other mothers who reside in the 10-room \u2018face-me-I-face-you'(single room) apartment. With zero urban planning, houses, mostly of the \u2018face-me-I-face-you\u2019 pattern, are built in a disorganised manner with barely enough space for movement from one house to the other, and out of the area. Outside the house, residents and passersby have to walk gingerly while making their way through the access paths so as to avoid making contact with wraps of poop.\n\n\u201cThose who don\u2019t like using the dumpsite excrete inside wraps of nylon, and throw out through their windows onto that path where people walk through,\u201d Abass said.\n\n\u201cSome of the wraps of poop could be there for weeks until we get tired of the smell and then we go and clean it up. But this only lasts just a few moments before everywhere is littered again,\u201d she lamented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMOST HOUSES ARE WITHOUT TOILET\n\nThe expansive dumpsite behind Abass\u2019 house serves over 100 households in the area. Abbas, who has lived in the area for about 10 years, explained how the one-time small heap of dirt and poop gradually rose to a huge dumpsite, fuelled by the fact that most houses lack sewage facilities.\n\n\u201cOf about 100 houses here, you will hardly see 10 that have toilets,\u201d said Lukman Ahmed, another resident whose house is within close proximity to the dumpsite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany years ago when most of the houses in the area were under construction, Ahmed said their great grandfathers didn\u2019t think about toilets.\n\n\u201cWe live in these houses now, so, where do you want us to use as toilets? That is why any available space here, people, over the years, quickly make use of to dispose of their poop and other wastes.\u201d\n\nIn the recent past, the state government made provisions for sewage collection from these households, but residents said this had since stopped. Some, however, blamed it on the fact that most of the houses are not accessible for sewage trucks provided by the government.\n\n\u201cThe houses were built without a standard layout, and there\u2019s no road for cars or even trucks to get to some of these houses,\u201d Ahmed added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the edge of the dumpsite is a tent where children from the neighbourhood gather in the evening for Quranic lessons. Despite the stench of feces \u2014 so bad that it could provoke puking \u2013, the children appeared unbothered as they chanted loudly in Arabic, effusively and almost in competition with each other. When thirsty, or in need of water for ablution, the only source available to the children is the well dug on the fringes of the dumpsite.\n\nAbdullahi Ambali, the mualim(teacher) on whose house the tent for the Arabic class rests, is worried, especially about the safety of the children that gather around him every evening. On Sundays, he would ask his students and other young people in the area to help clear the site, at least the part closer to where the lessons hold.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do this, the whole place would have been overwhelmed. Take a look at the dumpsite, it is now as high as the storey buildings around it,\u201d the mualim said.\n\nUnlike other residents, Ambali has constructed a latrine in his house for his use, and the use of his students. He wishes other residents could do the same, and just maybe, they could move an inch closer to a hygienic environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABANDONED LATRINES\u2026 UNCOMPLETED BUILDINGS\n\nOn the other side of Gambari is the Okelele community where most of the \u2018face-me-I-face-you\u2019 houses are also without toilets. Years ago, residents had put resources together to construct latrines, each strategically positioned to serve at least 50 nearby households. They initially contended with the problem of space to dig the pits, but some houses with bigger yards eventually yielded a portion of their lands for the latrines. The latrines, however, barely functioned for two years, and residents had since returned to open defecation.\n\nLack of cooperation among most of the households, Yakubu Ganiyu, one of the residents, said led to the rot of the latrines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe explained that \u201ceach household was billed N200 monthly for maintenance, but it got to a point that people stopped paying\u201d. Before now, the contributed sum was mainly used in hiring sewage disposal trucks that emptied the latrine pits on a monthly basis.\n\n\u201cSome of us are worried, and because we can\u2019t pull all the resources alone to hire sewage disposal trucks, we started burning the things off, and we could only do that for a short while,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother preferred location for open defecation is uncompleted buildings. For those whose houses are within range, as soon as they are done wrapping their poop in nylon, they fling it into the uncompleted building\u2013 a popular act referred to as \u2018shotput\u2019. From the artisan heading back from work to the commercial motorcycle rider on duty, the uncompleted building serves as an emergency restroom should the need arise.\n\nDRAINAGE TURNED COMMUNITY TOILET\n\nAlthough there is a signboard warning against defecation in the drainage in the Amule area and neighbouring communities, residents seem not to care. Almost everyone whose house is within close proximity to the drainage has turned it into a toilet.\n\nLetting out a smile, Asmiyu Biliamin, a trader and resident in Amule, said: \u201cWe are lucky to have this drainage pass by our backyard.\u201d\n\nFrom morning till evening, residents, mostly children, can be seen bending at the edge of the drainage and discharging their feces. Worse still, some of the residents have used zinc to construct open roof toilets, passing the pipes directly into the drainage.\n\n\u201cBut what do you want us to do when we don\u2019t have toilets? Should we kill ourselves? Even the government knows there is nothing they can do to us,\u201d Biliamin retorted when shown the warning on the signboard.\n\n\u201cIn all of this area, this drainage is our toilet, we don\u2019t have anywhere to go. If any government is going to arrest us, it should first build us toilets,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the same vein as Billiamin, other residents accused the government of not providing them with public toilets and waste disposal tanks, and this had left them with no option than to turn to the drainage when nature comes calling.\n\nCLASSROOM SHUT DOWN OVER \u2018POOP SMELL\u2019\n\nThe environmental pollution is becoming unbearable for pupils and teachers of the secondary school in Amule, which also sits close to the drainage. The fence of the school named after Bukola Saraki, a former governor of the state, is weakened and falling apart, consequently, exposing some of the classrooms to the feces-littered drainage.\n\nThe school says it has been calling on the government for help, but no succour has been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cIt is a terrible smell\u2026 both teachers and pupils find it difficult to stay inside the classrooms,\u201d one of the teachers said.\n\n\u201cWe had to shut down one of the classes because the smell was too much to bear. We have written a series of letters calling for assistance. Sadly, too, we\u2019ve not had a functioning toilet for our students since the one here got bad.\u201d\n\n\u2018RESIDENTS PRONE TO DIARRHEA, CHOLERA\u2019\n\nThe major source of water in most of the communities visited by TheCable are wells.

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis, and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad, or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria, is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole, than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in app integrations. But, as none of these payment aps are widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalaskasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller micro transactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest growing economies in sub-saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Shuttlers raises $1.6 million to expand to Nigerian cities",
          "text": "Shuttlers, a logistics startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to expand into African countries.\n\nThe investment round was led by VestedWorld, a Chicago-and-Africa-based investment firm, with Interswitch, Rising Tide Africa, Launch Africa, EchoVC, CMC 21 & Alsa, ShEquity, Five35, Consonance Investment, CcHub Syndicate, Sakore, and Nikky Taurus also participating in the raise.\n\nWith its new raise, Shuttlers intends to try its wheels in more Nigerian cities before expanding beyond the borders of the country into other African countries.\n\nShuttling Lagos\u2019 transportation system\n\nIn 2016, Damilola Olokesusi founded Shuttlers to tackle the inefficient transportation system in Lagos, Africa\u2019s most populous city. The startup was a tech-enabled bus-sharing company targeted at helping Lagosians commute in comfort at affordable rates.\n\nAt the time, Lagos was a city holding 23 million people and 90% of its transport system was road-based, with semi-formal mini buses or danfos accounting for 45% of trips while walking accounted for 40%. According to the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority in 2015, the city alone also accounted for 30% of the total number of road vehicles in Nigeria, with a vehicular density of 234 cars per kilometre.\n\nAlthough Lagos has a number of federal roads, its transport system is epileptic due to the poor nature of some of the roads and the lack of a formal or public transport system which accounts for only 2.5% of the system.\n\nShuttlers\u2019 solution\n\nAt launch, Shuttlers did not have a mobile app.\n\nThe company\u2019s model at the time was messenger-based, using Slack, email and WhatsApp to communicate routes and timelines to its customers. One of their very first clients was Andela, which took advantage of the startup\u2019s B2B2C option to ferry its workers across the state.\n\nBy 2019, Shuttlers revamped to introduce a mobile app where customers could subscribe to any of the three plans available, which includes a B2B where business clients pay the total fares of their employees, and B2C where individual customers pay fares themselves.\n\nPresently, the platform offers additional features including live bus tracking, digital payments and an on-trip menu.\n\nAlthough the company has only managed to raise about $6,000 in angel investments and grants, Shuttlers\u2019 route has been lauded with immense growth as the company claims to have over 10,000 users across its web and mobile-based platforms. With over 100 buses and 300 bus stops in Lagos, Shuttlers also claims to have recorded over 2 million trips since its inception in 2013.\n\nMoving forward\n\nFor CEO Damilola Olokesusi, the raise validates the hard work her team has put in for the past five years. Olokesusi also believes that it\u2019s an encouraging nod for female entrepreneurs in the tech space. \u201cIt shows that women can thrive in any industry they choose, especially tech which is highly male-dominated,\u201d she told TechCabal. \u201cI\u2019m not only a female entrepreneur, I\u2019m a huge supporter of women who are making a difference in their industries. I hope the work I do at Shuttlers inspires women to be daring with their aspirations.\u201d\n\nInvestors are also excited for the future of Shuttlers with Olokesusi at the helm. \u201cWe are very excited to back Damilola in this venture and work alongside a group of committed financial and strategic investors to scale this further,\u201d said Lavanya Anand, Principal at VestedWorld.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Shuttlers and its mission, the CEO emphasized the company\u2019s mission to transform the commuting challenges in African cities. \u201cOur mission at Shuttlers is to transform the way people commute around the world, by building a global partner network and connecting communities of shuttlers like we are presently doing in Lagos, Nigeria. The negative impact of inefficiencies in the mobility space is visible in the quality of life, mental health, and work productivity of commuters. We also see its impact on the more vulnerable and neglected population in our society; women, children, physically challenged, and the elderly. I\u2019m confident that our smart mobility solutions can solve some of these urban mobility challenges sustainably and also reduce carbon emission.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Real estate emerges world\u2019s most popular store of wealth",
          "text": "Countries store over 60% of wealth in real estate\n\nTwo-thirds of global net worth is stored in real estate and only about 20 percent in other fixed assets, according to consulting firm, McKinsey.\n\nA recent report by the New York-based company states that the high share of countries\u2019 wealth that is stored in the property market raises questions about whether societies store their wealth productively.\n\nBreakdown of the report reveals that the value of residential real estate amounted to almost half of global net worth in 2020, while corporate and government buildings and land accounted for an additional 20 percent.\n\nGlobal net wealth jumped to $514 trillion in 2020, rising by $358 trillion from 2000 levels, according to a McKinsey report cited by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe are now wealthier than we have ever been,\u201d Jan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute in Zurich, told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nAssets that drive much of economic growth include infrastructure, industrial structures, machinery and equipment; intangibles \u2013 as well as inventories and mineral reserves make up the rest.\n\nOn why most countries store a large part of their wealth in real estate, McKinsey cites the product of high quantity and quality of housing, high construction costs relative to other prices in the economy, or high land prices. The trend has been consistent since 2000.\n\n\u201cGrowth in household real estate wealth stemmed from rising home prices, with the cost of land and construction also increasing,\u201d it states.\n\nAlso, analysis of the report reveals that the rising land prices, which accounted for more than half of the increased value of the global household real estate and about 75 percent of the growth in Australia and the United Kingdom, was the most significant driver of household real estate stock growth from 2000 to 2020.\n\nAccording to the report, nearly all net worth growth from 2000 to 2020 occurred in the household sector as a result of growing equity and real estate valuations.\n\nExplaining further, McKinsey says the real assets held by households consisted almost exclusively of real estate and was fuelled by the growth in household net worth. Household net worth grew from 4.2 times GDP in 2000 to 5.7 times GDP in 2020.\n\nThe residential sub-sector of the real estate market, which attracted the most of the global net worth in the review period, also mirrors the trend that has been witnessed in the property market in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nOpportunities exist for investors in residential real estate. Tokunbo Ajayi, CEO, Propertygate Development and Investment Company, confirms this, saying much of the opportunities here are in small-size residential family units.\n\n\u201cThe reason developers and investors opt for these small-size units such as one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments is because large-size luxury housing units cannot find buyers,\u201d he explains.\n\nCompared with other asset classes or market segments, the residential real estate market in many parts of Nigeria, including Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan and Enugu, remains strong and resilient to the impact of COVID-19, the 2021 half-year report on Nigerian Real Estate Market by Northcourt shows.\n\n\u201cThe demand for gated estates within leading cities that intensified towards the end of Q4, 2020, continued for much of half year 2021,\u201d Ayo Ibaru, Northcourt\u2019s COO/director of Real Estate Research, states.\n\nAccording to Ibaru, the findings by Northcourt suggest a general decline in vacancy rates across Lagos and a spike in demand for assets in gated communities for security purposes.\n\nThe full re-opening of the Nigerian economy following the ease in lockdown restrictions and increase in investors\u2019 appetite for the real estate market amid the low-interest rate environment helped the property sector to post its highest growth in six years in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nRead also: Relive Housing targets early career professionals, first-time homeowners with Cornerstone Height\n\nNigeria\u2019s real estate sector expanded by 3.85 percent in the second quarter of 2021, the highest second-quarter growth the sector has recorded since the 4.95 percent growth in Q2, 2014, as analysed from data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nCompared with the corresponding quarter of 2020, when Nigeria\u2019s property sector contracted by 21.99 percent, the 3.85 percent GDP growth reported in the second quarter of this year is higher by 25.84 percentage points, and 2.08 percentage points higher relative to Q1, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis shows investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigeria real estate sector as a subsector of the economy which thrives despite the current inflation and devaluation of the naira,\u201d Freeman Osonuga, Real Estate Investor, Advisor and Best-Selling Author, says.\n\nReal asset with highest investment globally\n\nWith 67 percent share of the global real asset investment, real estate ranks the top on the list, according to McKinsey.\n\nThe closest to real estate was fixed asset with a share of 17 percent, 50 percentage points gap between the values reported for the property market. Inventories recorded 8 percent while intangibles and non-produced products recorded 4 percent each.\n\nAccording to the recent report by the advisory firm, three major components drove the expansion in global net worth: the real estate boom and valuation gain common to all countries, except Japan; rising values of and investment in corporate assets, especially in China and Mexico; and growth in net financial assets among net exporters, those with consistent current account surpluses (in other words, accumulating net asset positions).\n\n\u201cReal estate fuelled at least 50 percent of net worth expansion relative to GDP in all countries other than China and Japan,\u2019 it said.\n\nThe most significant growth in real estate stock was in Australia, Canada, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (China saw the greatest home price growth but also had significant GDP growth, and as a result had more muted growth of real estate in relation to GDP), analysed from McKinsey\u2019s report.\n\nType of real estate with most investment globally\n\nThe residential sub-sector of the global real estate market has the most investment by value, as analysed from the McKinsey\u2019s report.\n\nThe value of residential real estate amounted to about half of global net worth in 2020, while corporate and government buildings and land accounted for an additional 20 percent.\n\nAccording to the data, land/residential real estate accounted for 51 percent of the global real estate investment in 2020, higher than the 49 percent that was reported for the non-residential arm of the property market.",

          "text": "Mo Abudu, the CEO of EbonyLife Group, is known for several firsts in the media space, and is adding another feather to her hat. For the first time in history, a case study about a female African media entrepreneur titled: \u2018The Harvard Business School \u2013 EbonyLife Case Study,\u2019 will be taught at Harvard Business School (HBS) to over 1,000 MBA students.\n\n\u201cEbonyLife turns 10 next year, so the case reflects on how we started and where we are today. It will also highlight our challenges along the way,\u201d Abudu said. She revealed in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay that she is currently on the HBS campus in Boston where this case study will be taught, and also to share her story with the students and faculty.\n\nWhat this means is that, first-year students at HBS will study a case about an African company, led by a Nigerian woman. It will become one of approximately 500 case studies read by students over the course of the two-year MBA programme. Nearly half of these cases are based on global organisations.\n\nRead Also: Netflix\u2019s Nigerian original film, \u2018Blood Sisters\u2019 from Mo Abudu\u2019s EbonyLife wraps production\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to listening to them and answering their questions. I am humbled and honoured to be chosen for this, and I will always do all I can to encourage everyone out there on the possibilities and results that abound in daring to excel, because as I always say, if you can think it, you can do it,\u201d Abudu said.\n\nWhen Mo Abudu launched EbonyLife TV in 2013, her primary goal for the channel was to create a more positive narrative around Africa. What followed was a string of aspirational TV series to include Fifty, Castle & Castle, Sons of the Caliphate and The Governor, among others.\n\nHer desire to change the narrative about Africa in the international scene birthed her love for filmmaking with the creation of EbonyLife Films in 2014. She has produced different blockbusters such as: Fifty, The Wedding Party, Chief Daddy, The Royal Hibiscus Hotel and Your Excellency. Furthermore, she was the executive producer of \u00d2l\u00f2t\u016br\u00e9, a feature film that exposes the shady business of human trafficking in Nigeria. The film premiered as a Netflix Original in October 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Sony Pictures Television (SPT) announced a three-year deal with EbonyLife TV that would include co-production of The Dahomey Warriors. In 2019, AMC Networks (USA) announced its partnership with EbonyLife to produce Nigeria 2099, an afro-futuristic crime-drama created by EbonyLife. Also, in June 2020, Netflix signed a multi-title deal with EbonyLife to create two original series and multiple branded films and a series. In February 2021, EbonyLife Media signed a First Look deal with Sony Pictures and a slate of co-produced film and television projects with Will and Jada Smith\u2019s Westbrook Studios.\n\nMost recently, EbonyLife Studios and Will Packer Productions are teaming to develop an untitled project, based on Evan Ratliff\u2019s Bloomberg article, \u2018The Fall of the Billionaire Gucci Master.\u2019\n\nThe HBS case study is to be presented in two parts \u2013 A and B. Case study A chronicles the journey of EbonyLife Media from inception to December 2020, while case study B provides a summary of what has occurred between January and October 2021.\n\nHaving read case study A, the students will have to consider the choices told in the HBS case study abstract and give their analysis. In relating with Abudu and understanding case study B, they will discover what has changed since the case was written and what the value of their assessment and recommendations have been.\n\nWhat this feat also means is that, Mo Abudu will be joining a long list of CEOs, including Warren Buffet and Elon Musk, whose strategies and decisions have been analysed in HBS case studies.\n\n\u201cAt first, I was surprised by Harvard\u2019s interest in us; however, I can now see how a diverse faculty and student body could benefit from looking at how companies in Africa and other parts of the world deal with challenges unique to their environment. I\u2019m looking forward to the discussions and the students\u2019 perspectives,\u201d said Abudu.\n\nShe oversees the EbonyLife Group, which includes all EbonyLife Media assets and EbonyLife Place, Nigeria\u2019s first luxury entertainment resort. She is also a part of OSCARS in the producer membership category, and she is the only African woman selected in this category. Forbes described her as \u201cAfrica\u2019s Most Successful Woman,\u201d while CNN said she was \u201cAfrica\u2019s Queen of Media who conquered the continent.\u201d\n\nAbudu is highly sought after for her knowledge of the African and global creative industry. She has spoken at the Wharton School of Business, Cambridge University Judge School of Business, NYU, Oxford University and Harvard University. Throughout the years, Abudu has been a recipient of numerous awards and international recognitions.",

          "text": "The House of Representatives on Thursday took steps to remove the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) from the control of the executive arm of the Nigerian Government and domicile it in the Judiciary \u2013 an independent arm of the Government.\n\nThis is as the House passed through second reading, a bill to alter the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 with a view to removing the CCT, an adjudicatory body, from the Executive Arm and placing it under the judiciary as a superior court of record.\n\nSponsored by Solomon Bob (PDP, Rivers) and Olajide Olatunbosun (APC, Oyo) the bill proposes to amend principally sections 6, 84, 240, 243, 254, 294, 295, 316 of the constitution among others that deal with superior courts of record and sought to incorporate the CCT among them.\n\nLeading debate on the bill, Bob said in a presidential democracy such as Nigeria\u2019s, the three arms of government \u2013 the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary are distinct and separate in functions, powers and composition.\n\nHe said the distinct separation of powers is intended to secure the independence of each arm and for each to act as a check on the exercise of power by the other, which ultimately enhances the effective discharge of their respective constitutional responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIt is not, therefore, by accident that the constitution specifically sets out the powers of each of the three arms as spelt out in sections 4, 5 & 6 for the Legislature, Executive and the Judiciary respectively.\n\n\u201cThe Code of Conduct Tribunal \u2013 the focal point of this Bill \u2013 is undoubtedly a judicial body created by paragraph 15 of the 5th schedule to the constitution and section 20 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act. It is a statutory body saddled with the responsibility of trying offences under the Code of Conduct Bureau Act.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is absurd and indeed confounding that a judicial tribunal clothed with enormous powers to sanction public officers found guilty of violating the Code of Conduct Act, including the power to order forfeiture and bar offenders from holding public office, is placed under the Executive rather than the Judiciary, an arm where it rightly belongs,\u201d Bob said.\n\nRead also: #EndSARS Panel report opens window into police brutality\n\nHe argued that paragraph 18(2) of the 5th schedule of the Constitution which deals with the powers of the Tribunal provides in extenso; \u2018the punishment which the Code of Conduct Tribunal may impose.\u2019\n\nThe sanctions include: \u201cVacation of office or seat in any legislative house, as the case may be; disqualification from membership of a legislative house and from the holding of any public office for a period not exceeding ten years; and Seizure and forfeiture to the state of any property acquired in abuse or corruption of office.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker said these provisions clearly clothe the Tribunal as a judicial body with the powers of a competent court of record, adding that the failure to situate it under the judicial arm of government is contrary to the principle of separation of powers\n\n\u201cTo illustrate this point, Mr. Speaker, Honourable colleagues, it is noteworthy to point out here that the highest court of this land has held in the case of Saraki vs FRN (2016) LPELR 46013 SC that the chairman and members of the Code of Conduct Tribunal are not judicial officers. That being the case, they are not subject to the discipline and sanction of the National Judicial Council like other judicial officers.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the offices of the chairman and members of the Code of Conduct Tribunal are clearly omitted in the judicial oath contained in the 7th schedule to the constitution.\n\n\u201cHonourable colleagues, giving effect to this amendment will, therefore, make members of the Tribunal judicial officers with the attendant protection and privileges which that will afford, besides securing the funding of the Tribunal as its funding will be charged on the consolidated revenue of the federation and released directly to the head as statutory transfers. This will in turn immune them substantially from the manipulation or control of the Executive.\n\n\u201cHonourable Colleagues, under a presidential democracy, one single arm of government ought not exercise executive and judicial powers such as is the case presently. The horrifying consequences or dangers of placing the Tribunal under the Executive as it is today are clear for us all to see. Its independence is non-existent and its instrumentalization by the executive as a weapon against the legislature and the judiciary is evident and undeniable.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, by way of citing a precedent, this Honourable House in the 6th Assembly vide the 3rd Alteration of the constitution similarly took a bold decision and upgraded the National Industrial Court to a superior court of record, which today has helped in no small measure in the dispensation of justice by that court.\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker, Honourable colleagues, history beckons once again and such legislative intervention is just as desirable, if not more, in the present case in order to fully realize the objectives for which the tribunal was established, enhance its capacity to deliver on those objectives, maintain the very important division of functions among the three arms of government and further entrench and strengthen our democracy,\u201d he added.",

This has contributed to ending poverty in the state.\u201d\n\nNoting that the government has undertaken nuanced reforms to achieve economic revolution in the state, she said \u201cit is in the best interest of the citizens of the state to achieve the SDGs in line with global practice to end poverty and achieve decent work and economic growth by 2030.\u201d\n\nEnumerating the indicators which show the efforts and success made in achieving the mentioned Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), she noted that the decision of companies like Nosak Group, Saro Africa Group, among others, to locate in the state, is an indication that the state is doing a lot to create the enabling environment for businesses to flourish.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cIf you listened to Mr. Governor at the Alaghodaro summit, you would have heard him say over 102,000 hectares of land have been allocated for oil palm plantation and production. This is to enable private businesses to invest in the sector, thereby creating more jobs and wealth so as to end poverty in the state, which is in line with goal one in SDGs.\n\n\u201cHe also said, in the next five years, Edo will produce a minimum of ten thousand software engineers. All these efforts are to make life better for citizens of the state.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt is important to mention that the International poverty line currently is at $1.90 a day. It is the universal standard for measuring global poverty. This line helps measure the number of people living in extreme poverty and helps compare poverty levels between countries.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the things we are trying to deal with and to deal with these issues, we must make an effort to create jobs for all.\n\n\u201cAlso understand that economic growth is the economic prosperity of a nation and its people, but for economic prosperity to happen there must be economic productivity. So, people need to do well as individuals and as a society. For that to happen, the people must be productive, they must be creating things to sell and rendering services that people will pay for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what the sustainable development goal eight is and Edo State is striving hard to achieve this. The number of ongoing projects in this state right now shows the readiness to create more jobs and wealth to end poverty,\u201d Alufohai added.\n\n...",

Who are the victims and where are they from? Are women and girls more affected? How do traffickers operate?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswering these questions is critical not only to better understand trafficking in persons but most importantly, to better prevent and combat this crime and its complex and always evolving dynamics.

This week\u2019s session is taking place in Benin City (South-South), and benefits not only NAPTIP and NIS officers but also members of the Edo State Taskforce Against Human Trafficking.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nMembers of The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of the All Progressive Congress (APC) loyal to former governor of Osun State and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, were on Thursday, chased away from their meeting venue by gunmen who shot sporadically into the air, forcing its members to scamper for safety.\n\nAddressing a press conference after the incident, Chairman of the group, Reverend Adelowo Adebiyi accused Governor Adegboyega Oyetola led-IleriOluwa group of masterminding the attack.\n\nAdebiyi said the attack confirms the alarm he raised on Monday that the governor\u2019s men were out to assassinate TOP\u2019s leaders.\n\nHe wondered why the governor\u2019s camp would be after the lives of fellow party members because of their assiduous efforts at revitalising the party in the state.\n\nAdebiyi said it was high time President Muhammadu Buhari and leaders of security agencies called Governor Oyetola and his men to order, saying that the Thursday\u2019s attack on members of the Hon Rasaq Salinsile led faction of the Osun APC has shown their desperation.\n\nThe former APC Chairman stated: \u201cThe thugs believed to have been sent by the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u2019s led IleriOluwa faction of the party invaded the weekly meeting of TOP around 2:10pm today. I was just addressing the caucus when the thugs started shooting. This led to a stampede as APC members scampered for safety. Luckily for us, there were no major casualty as members ran into the main building for safety. But some of our people were wounded.\n\n\u201cWe need to state that officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) who usually provide security for the weekly meeting were not on ground. Because of the absence of the NSCDC officers, the IleriOluwa group sent thugs to attack us. One Tesleem Raji, aka Akerele from Ile Esu, Ikoyi, Isokan Local Government of the state sent the thugs that attacked us here. That is the same guy that led the attack on us during the state congress. Today\u2019s attack is coming three days after we raised alarm that the IleriOluwa people have concluded plans to eliminate leaders of TOP and other members of our party.\n\n\u201cI released a statement three days ago that some of our leaders were to be assassinated in the state by the IleriOluwa group, today\u2019s attack bears us witness that they are indeed after us.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind security agencies in the state that they are responsible for the safety of the lives and property of our people. They should not wait until one of us is killed before they act on our petitions and reports. We will officially inform the Commissioner of Police, the AIG Zone XI and the State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on today\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a serious concern for all of us in the state. We have been holding weekly meetings for the past four months. We have not attacked anyone. We urge the President to intervene now. Why will the government be using thugs to attack members of the same party openly in the afternoon? On August 16, the same set of people attacked us at the party secretariat. We were arrested and arraigned in court instead of the perpetrators of the attack. But the court set us free. During the state congress, they came to attack us again and two of our members were shot.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago, they attacked some of our members in Ipetumodu, Ife North Local Government during their meeting. Today again, the same things happened to us. We call on President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police to come and see what is happening in Osun.\u201d",

Because of this, they opened a branch in Nnewi. After Tayo, the new MD took over. I don\u2019t even know him. I saw him for the first time last year,\u201d Chukuma said.\n\n\u201cThey started fighting about tribe. I am not certain about this but I think the reason he (GTB) is fighting is because of tribe. I don\u2019t know exactly what his problem is.\n\n\u201cBut finally, I have proved him wrong in everything. I have defeated him in all the courts we went to. The only thing left is for him to pay me what he owes me.\n\n\u201cHe was going to my account and taking money anyhow. I discovered it, took him to court and won. Up till now, he hasn\u2019t paid and we have gone up to supreme court. Maybe he hasn\u2019t paid because he wants Nigeria to change their law because of him.\u201d\n\nThe CEO explained that he would no longer \u201cdisturb\u201d the bank to pay the debt, but would take over the bank\u2019s assets.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the whole thing is that the money is attracting the interest of 22 percent. So, I am waiting for the interest to be above their capacity so I can take over,\u201d Chukuma said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I am waiting for. I am not going to disturb them anymore. I am assuring all the customers of GTB that if I take over, I would still run it well. They shouldn\u2019t fear. I haven\u2019t done any business that fails.\u201d",

The report making rounds on social media is a draft of a minority opinion because I was there all through the proceedings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am particularly shocked to read what is contained in the report because it is not completely accurate.

          "title": "With telecoms shutdown: Bandits now use walkie talkie in Katsina \u2013 SSG",
          "text": "Amidst continued shutdown of telecoms services in Katsina state, bandits have resorted to use of Radio Frequency Walkie Talkie Transceivers, Secretary to the State Government (SSG) Mustapha Inuwa has said.\n\nThe SSG stated this Thursday during a media parley at the Government House Katsina.\n\nAt the parley were Commissioner of Police in the state, Sanusi Buba and the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security, Muhammad Ibrahim Katsina.\n\nAt the height of security challenge occasioned by activities of the bandits, the state government, via a Containment Order signed by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, had, among several measures, ordered the shutdown of telecommunications network in 13 local government areas considered the hotspots for banditry.\n\nThere were also outcries from some stakeholders who believed the shutdown had worsened the security situation of the people.\n\nFor instance, the state legislature recently tasked the Masari administration to up its game, saying the telecoms shutdown had left the people at the mercy of the bandits.\n\nSSG speaks in the contrary\n\nSpeaking to the contrary, however, SSG Inuwa said the telecoms ban had achieved the desired results in the state.\n\nWhile some level of successes had been recorded since the measures were put in place, Inuwa said the bandits had devised another means to carry out their acts.\n\nInuwa said: \u201cIn spite of the successes recorded, however, it is worthy to note that since the commencement of the Containment Order, the bandits\u2019 elements across the frontline local government areas have been unrelenting in devising new strategies aimed at circumventing the impact of the Containment Order.\n\n\u201cThe strategies range from attacking motorists/motorcyclists to siphon PMS from fuel tanks, to ransacking communities and coercing villages into sourcing PMS on their behalf. A recent and most worrisome move by the criminals is the observed acquisition of Radio Frequency Walkie Talkie Transceivers by the bandits.\u201d\n\nInuwa, who also chairs the security committee in the state, however, said security agents were on the trail of bandits using the walkie talkies.\n\nCasualties\n\nHe further said 480 suspected bandits were arrested between March and September 2021, 216 under prosecution and 42 others undergoing investigation.\n\nFrom September to date, he said, 244 suspects were arrested with 80 under prosecution and 33 under investigation.\n\nInuwa, who said there was a reduction in bandits\u2019 attacks since the Containment Order, also added that from September to date, 244 suspects were arrested with 33 under investigation and 80 under prosecution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Containment Order is a child of necessity, and has not been put in place to hurt or cause hardship to the citizens of the state. The driving objective was to arrest the emerging situation that was becoming a threat to peace, order and our collective well being.\u201d\n\nThe SSG also confirmed the killing of 213 people and abduction of over 676 innocent citizens within the period of four months across the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cA total of 475 persons were abducted between July and August while only 201 were abducted between September and October.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, between July and August, 97 armed banditry attacks were staged resulting in 130 deaths while only 56 incidents were recorded between September and October with 83 deaths.\n\n\u201cIncidents of cattle rustling also dropped significantly during the period as 1,347 cows, 345 sheep and 119 goats were stolen between July and August while 676 cows, 109 sheep and 160 goats were rustled between September and October.\u201d\n\nThe SSG, who was silent on the number of rescued victims, said the committee concentrated on the enforcement of Containment Order.\n\n\u201cFrom the 230 various bandits attacked we recorded, only 115 victims were injured, 213 lost their lives in the struggle.\u201d\n\nInuwa appealed to people of the state to give necessary support to the Containment Order by reporting informants and people with suspicious character to security agencies.\n\nHe said the order was adopted collectively by the North-west states to tackle the menace of banditry after series of security operations had failed to produce the desired result.\n\nIllela killings\n\nIn a related development, armed bandits have, in series of attacks, killed 43 people in five communities of Munwadata, Kalmalo, Sarma, Runji Tunbulunkun, and Tafkin Taramniya, all in Illela local government area of Sokoto state.\n\nGovernor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this Thursday when he led members of the state executive security chieftains as well as other top government officials on a condolence visit to the people of Illela, a border town of about 97 kilometers from the state capital.\n\nAccording to report, the marauders had attacked Kalmalo town and some villages near it in the wee hours of Monday at first instance, killing thirteen people.\n\nHowever, at the time of the governor\u2019s visit Wednesday afternoon the toll had risen to 43.\n\nThe report said a village head in one of the five villages was wounded during the night attack.\n\nTambuwal, had during the visit to Illela town told his bereaved audience that: \u201cWe\u2019re here to, on behalf of the government and good people of our dear state, to extend our heartfelt condolences on this unfortunate incident which claimed the lives of many of our citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is not a small occurrence. It is upsetting, this incident really touched us.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended the local government authorities, monarchs and community leaders for their lawful composition of a volunteer group working in tandem with the security operatives in the area.\n\nThe governor said the state government \u201cwill continue to frown upon the constitution of illegitimate volunteers,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe joint operations of legitimately constituted volunteers, who work closely with and under the supervision of security agencies, is the appropriate antidote to this crisis.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the people to remain undaunted by the recent attack, \u201cInstead, it should motivate you all to redouble your efforts, without seeking revenge, in securing your communities.\u201d\n\nThe governor assured them of sustained government assistance \u201cwhenever required\u201d, while praying for the repose of the souls of the deceased.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, pray that God grant them eternal glory and forgive their shortcomings and sins while they were alive. May He also grant their families and relatives the fortitude to bear the losses of those who died just as we besiege Him to grant health and relief to those who sustained injuries and are recuperating at home and in the hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe, again, pray to God to continue to ensure that peace prevails in all our communities and across the country. I, once again, urge you to be patient and prayerful. I am delighted with the communal efforts at cooperation and prayers, led by the monarchs and community leaders here, being offered for the intercession of God in bringing us peace. Please, do not relent. May Allah grant us peace and peaceful coexistence,\u201d he further prayed.\n\nOgun\n\nMeanwhile, the Ogun State House of Assembly Thursday passed a resolution calling on the state government and all security agencies in the state to place a ban on street carnivals and the usage of fireworks during the coming yuletide.\n\nThe move, according to the lawmakers, was to forestall any security breach and also prevent further spread of COVID-19 among residents.\n\nThe passage of the resolution followed an extended debate by lawmakers leading to a motion moved by the Majority Leader, Yusuf Sheriff.\n\nThe motion was seconded by a member representing Ijebu North I State Constituency, Sylvester Abiodun and supported by all the lawmakers at the plenary presided over by Speaker Olakunle Oluomo in Abeokuta.\n\nThe lawmakers who spoke in unison said it was imperative for the state government to consider suspending any form of carnival or street procession which could further affect the security situation in the state, noting that such event organised in the past had resulted in clashes leading to breach of public peace.\n\nPassing the motion, Speaker Oluomo said the lawmakers\u2019 decision was in the best interest of the state, saying the Assembly as an institution would not allow any criminal act under the guise of carnivals, disrupt the relative peace in the state.\n\nHe also said there was need to avoid any act that could further spread COVID-19 among the residents.\n\nHe thereafter directed the Clerk and Head of Legislative Services, Mr. \u2018Deji Adeyemo to convey the Assembly\u2019s resolution to Governor Dapo Abiodun and all security formations.\n\nIn another development, Speaker Oluomo has announced that the Assembly would hold a stakeholders\u2019 forum on \u201cH.B. No. 072/OG/2021- the Ogun State Anti-Corruption Law, 2021- A Bill for a law to Establish the Ogun State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law and for connected purposes\u201d tomorrow, Friday, 19th November, 2021 at the Assembly Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nAccording to him, the public hearing would take place at 10:00am prompt; while all relevant stakeholders are enjoined to be seated by 9.30 am prompt.",

          "text": "The crisis within the All Progressives Congress (APC) may not abate any soon as dozens of armed policemen in four patrol vans were Wednesday drafted to man the entry and exit points of its national secretariat, otherwise known as Buhari House, on Blantyre Street, Wuse 2 Abuja.\n\nBlueprint learnt that the national leadership of the ruling party was acting on a tip-off of a planned protest by some aggrieved party members.\n\nApart from policemen, personnel of the Directorate of Security Services (DSS) were also seen strategically around the party house.\n\nIt was gathered that as early as 11:30 am, security was tightened as all roads leading to the party secretariat were barricaded and armed policemen were seen conducting searches on humans and vehicles moving towards the party Secretariat.\n\nPatrol vehicles were strategically positioned at both Valencia Hotel and Barcelona Hotel ends of Blantyre Street, while another van was positioned directly behind the secretariat along Ibrahim Babangida Way to forestall any attempt for the protesters to gain easy access into the secretariat.\n\nAt about 1.30 pm, personnel of the DSS Special Force, on a patrol van and power bikes were seen patrolling along Blantyre Street to provide additional security backups.\n\nBlueprint also learnt that all the measures were put in place to frustrate an alleged plan by some aggrieved leaders of the party to cause chaos through protest at the Buhari House.\n\nA security source at the APC secretariat said: \u201cWe had security report that some people have plans to come and protest here. The national leadership had to order the deployment of police and other security agencies to forestall any breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time we are seeing this kind of deployment at the secretariat. It showed that some party members are aggrieved and there is a limit to what they can do to continue to stop the protesters. The committee should also know that they have overstayed their welcome and should be ready to conduct the National Convention. They cannot be there forever. From six months to one year and still counting.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s mere routine check \u2013 Party\n\nBut when contacted for official comments, National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) John James Akpanudoedehe, told newsmen that the heavy presence of the security men was a mere routine check to protect lives and property.\n\n\u201cOh, nothing is happening. They have been there several times whenever we need to safeguard the secretariat. You are not in a position to read security reports.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that have to do with security that you are not aware of. It\u2019s a routine thing. We have to protect the people who work here, we read security reports and I\u2019m sure you are fully aware we have every security agency in our secretariat. We are only acting on security reports, there is no cause for alarm,\u201d Akpanudoedehe stated.\n\nMarafa on \u2018expulsion plan\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa has dismissed the threat by APC caretaker committee to expel him from the party for expressing reservations on the legality of the committee and its activities, describing it as an empty threat.\n\nMarafa, who represented Zamfara Central Senatorial District in the eight National Assembly, had Sunday, threatened to institute a legal action against the committee Chairman and Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni over what he called the violation of the party\u2019s constitution in the conduct of the party\u2019s affairs.\n\nThe caretaker committee through its Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudodehe, had Monday, warned Marafa to submit to party supremacy or be sanctioned.\n\nReacting to the threat through a statement Wednesday in Abuja, Marafa said he cannot be silenced by the threat of the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cExpelling me from the party will only aggravate the problem. It will herald the beginning of the agitation; rule of law must be respected. The committee is an illegality and alien to the constitution of the party. We are building everything on nothing. Rather than the expulsion threat, the committee or the chairman should respond to issues I raised.\n\n\u201cWhat our party constitution says that rendered Buni-committee null and void.\n\n\u201cSection 17 (4) of the constitution of our beloved party, says \u2018 no officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently. Article 20 states the only way the leadership of the party can evolve.\n\n\u201cSection 13.3(iv) which was relied upon to create the illegal body called CECPC talked about the power of NEC to create committees.\n\n\u201cAPC is a political party not a committee, committees are created to serve a specific functions not to usurp the powers of the entire legal entity. The function of the Mai Mala committee is to plan a convention just as its name implies, Mai Mala is the chairman of the APC Convention Planning Committee and not APC itself,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe former Senator added that \u201cSection 12.3 lists the party\u2019s NEC members and it made the National Chairman of the party and NOT the chairman of any committee by whatever name as the chairman of the organ while section 12.3 (xxxi) list the president and vice president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as members only, so the question is; who approved the constitution and subsequent extensions of tenure of office of the illegal and obnoxious CECPC?\n\n\u201cWe will show him the way out dishonourably. We would not allow the party we contributed immensely to develop to be destroyed by overambitious self-centred and enemies of the party, and the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the party we laboured, toiled and laid the foundation for its success. We will not allow those who have little or no stake in the party to destroy it or to please certain individuals and achieve their selfish interest,\u201d he said.\n\nMarafa, while insisting that he has committed no offence, said the party should revert to the path of constitutionality and rule of law or face extinction.\n\nAPC won\u2019t descent low with Marafa \u2013Scribe\n\nAnd in its response, the party said Marafa can abuse any of its leaders but they won\u2019t go low with the former lawmaker.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen on the telephone Wednesday, the CCEPC scribe, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said APC is an institution which nobody can drag to the gutter.\n\n\u201cWe are not abusive to any member of our party; we are too mature to go into personal response. Our interest is in general public and then the party. We are not going to go back and forth with anybody. Any information that is giving out, we are duty bound to respond by stating the fact as it is.\n\n\u201cI will not descend to the level where Marafa talks and I reply, I\u2019m not going to do that. I have never been personal with anybody, he can abuse me, my duty is to explain to the public, my interest is to give balanced information for the public to see whether we are saying the truth or not. That\u2019s all; we are not going to enter into personal tirade of words. Nobody can drag me or the party to the gutter, we are an institution. They are not dealing with an individual but an institution,\u201d he said.",

And that is why we are saying give us state police,\u201d Ishaku lamented.\n\nHis comments were in response to a recent attack in Taraba by some suspected Ambazonian soldiers from the Republic of Cameroon.\n\nThe soldiers are said to have stormed Manga village in Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State on Wednesday, killing 11 people including a traditional ruler.\n\nTakum Local Government Area is a border community between Taraba State and the Republic of Cameroon.\n\nSpeaker in reaction to the incident, Ishaku said he has complained severally to the Nigerian military, seeking help to secure the border.\n\nThe governor further stated that his pleas have gone unheard for quite a while, leaving the community prone to attacks such as was recently experienced.\n\nAccording to Ishaku, there is little a governor can do in such a case, especially because he does not control the armed forces, neither does he have a state police force specifically put together for the service of the Taraba people.\n\n\u201cIf I have state police, I would have ordered the police. All the governors are helpless, not only Darius Ishaku that is helpless; not only Taraba State that is helpless. Go and ask other governors and tell me any who has a solution to this. We have to depend on Federal might\u201d he explained.\n\nIn forging a way forward, Governor Ishaku called for the military to help man Taraba\u2019s \u2018long-stretch\u2019 border with Cameroon.\n\n\u201cTaraba has one of the longest borders with Cameroon. There is an absolute need that this our boundary must be manned by security agencies. The military, precisely, must man it,\u201d the governor argued.\n\n\u201cBecause they (the separatists) are well armed, they are a separatist group, and when they kill, they run away. So it is not an easy thing, it has to be the military to man the border.\u201d\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s attack, the Governor said the military and police have now moved into the attacked community.\n\nHe expressed hopes that fleeing villagers can now return after Nigerian security officials were deployed to the area.",

We can\u2019t impose ideas on them. Federal Government has to wait for the reaction of the states.\u201d\n\nOn the recent removal of Nigeria from the watchlist of countries violating religious freedom, which Blinken said was \u201cbased on facts,\u201d Buhari expressed the country\u2019s appreciation, noting that there was freedom of worship in Nigeria, and no one is discriminated against on the basis of his or her faith.\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari Signs Climate Change, AMCON (Amendment) Bills Into Law\n\nBuhari Receives US Secretary Of State Blinken\n\nHe said also said education is a priority in the country, \u201cbecause when you educate a people, there are certain levels they will not fall below.\u201d\n\nThe President equally appreciated the US for allowing Nigeria to procure military hardware to fight terrorism in the country, and for the training given to the Nigerian military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping us to stabilize the situation in the Northeast, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 2015,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are doing a lot on security, and the people involved appreciate our efforts.\u201d\n\nOn the development of democratic ethos, President Buhari said Nigeria has adopted the American model, \u201chook, line, and sinker, with its term limits. Those who have attempted to breach it were disappointed, if not disgraced. You are even lucky if you have two terms. Others try hard and don\u2019t get it. The American model has been accepted by Nigerians as the best.\u201d\n\nNigeria and her neighbors, the President noted, have been living with the impact of climate change for a while, which has seen Lake Chad shrink drastically from its original size, and affected the livelihood of about 30 million people in the Lake Chad Basin countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why the youths defy the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean to attempt emigrating to Europe. Inter-basin water transfer is needed to keep the youths at home, and they can resume their lives of farming, fishing, and animal husbandry,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nMr Blinken, who had held a virtual meeting with the Nigerian President earlier in the year, said jocularly that it was now good to see him \u201cmask to mask, hoping that we will soon see face to face.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the contributions of President Buhari to the protection of the climate, particularly his presence and contributions at the recent COP26 climate conference held in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nBlinken said America and Nigeria have diverse challenges, but a common denominator is security, and hoped for better partnerships, \u201cso that the bad guys won\u2019t get the good guys.\u201d\n\nHe described the report of the EndSARS probe panel as \u201cdemocracy in action,\u201d stressing that America equally had its own police brutality, and hoping that necessary reforms would be made.",

          "text": "A detective in Florida investigating the disappearance of Carole Baskin\u2019s second husband said Thursday that the \u201cTiger King\u201d star had three times refused requests for interviews, and that the probe was ongoing.\n\nCpl. Moises Garcia of the Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Tampa held a news conference to provide an update on the investigation into Don Lewis\u2019 disappearance. The case was reopened following the March 2020 release of \u201cTiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,\u201d a Netflix documentary series which became a huge hit during the pandemic.\n\nLewis was a Tampa millionaire who vanished in 1997, leaving Baskin with dozens of big cats at their animal sanctuary. The series launched rumors about how Lewis disappeared, including conjecture that he was buried in a septic tank on the sanctuary\u2019s property or living in Costa Rica.\n\nThe detective said he and his investigators had conducted 50 interviews and followed up on 200 leads.\n\nWhen asked about the Costa Rica rumor, Garcia refused to comment, but he said federal agents had run down leads in the Central American country. Getting a search warrant for the animal sanctuary to follow up on the septic tank rumor would require probable cause, either evidence showing something happened on the property or a witness who could testify to that effect, he said.\n\nBesides Baskin, a former handyman at the sanctuary, Kenny Farr, also \u201cdidn\u2019t interview with us,\u201d the detective said.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for a spouse or relative to refuse to cooperate when a family member goes missing, and Baskin is a person of interest, though others are too, Garcia said.\n\nBaskin said Thursday in an email to The Associated Press that she has referred Garcia to her attorney. She pointed out she did everything she possibly could to assist detectives after Lewis\u2019 disappearance, including interviews, continued correspondence and unfettered access to the Big Cat Rescue property.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that I know that is not either in the Sheriff\u2019s files or in the diary I have published at SaveTheCats.org,\u201d Baskin said. \u201cAnd no way I am going to have a clearer memory, or anything to add, twenty-four years later.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question on Reddit this week, Baskin wrote that she believed that Lewis took off in a small experimental airplane that crashed into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t licensed to fly, yet did all the time. He couldn\u2019t file a flight plan and had to take off from closed airports to evade detection,\u201d Baskin said. \u201cI think this was the most likely scenario.\u201d\n\nBaskin recently sued Netflix and a production company to try to prevent the use of interviews and footage involving her in the \u201cTiger King\u201d sequel, which was released Wednesday. Netflix countered that Baskin and her husband agreed in writing that the material could be used in the future and that she is trying to block the company\u2019s First Amendment right to free speech.\n\nGarcia said he is confident Lewis\u2019 disappearance will be solved.\n\n\u201cIf you ask a homicide detective if he can solve a case, and he says no, you should take away his badge,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "At a busy market in a poor township outside Harare this week, Nyasha Ndou kept his mask in his pocket, as hundreds of other people, mostly unmasked, jostled to buy and sell fruit and vegetables displayed on wooden tables and plastic sheets. As in much of Zimbabwe, here the coronavirus is quickly being relegated to the past, as political rallies, concerts and home gatherings have returned.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is gone, when did you last hear of anyone who has died of COVID-19?\u201d Ndou said. \u201cThe mask is to protect my pocket,\u201d he said. \u201cThe police demand bribes so I lose money if I don\u2019t move around with a mask.\u201d Earlier this week, Zimbabwe recorded just 33 new COVID-19 cases and zero deaths, in line with a recent fall in the disease across the continent, where World Health Organization data show that infections have been dropping since July.\n\nWhen the coronavirus first emerged last year, health officials feared the pandemic would sweep across Africa, killing millions. Although it\u2019s still unclear what COVID-19\u2019s ultimate toll will be, that catastrophic scenario has yet to materialize in Zimbabwe or much of the continent.\n\nScientists emphasize that obtaining accurate COVID-19 data, particularly in African countries with patchy surveillance, is extremely difficult, and warn that declining coronavirus trends could easily be reversed.\n\nBut there is something \u201cmysterious\u201d going on in Africa that is puzzling scientists, said Wafaa El-Sadr, chair of global health at Columbia University. \u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t have the vaccines and the resources to fight COVID-19 that they have in Europe and the U.S., but somehow they seem to be doing better,\u201d she said.\n\nFewer than 6% of people in Africa are vaccinated. For months, the WHO has described Africa as \u201cone of the least affected regions in the world\u201d in its weekly pandemic reports.\n\nSome researchers say the continent\u2019s younger population \u2014 the average age is 20 versus about 43 in Western Europe \u2014 in addition to their lower rates of urbanization and tendency to spend time outdoors, may have spared it the more lethal effects of the virus so far. Several studies are probing whether there might be other explanations, including genetic reasons or exposure to other diseases.\n\nChristian Happi, director of the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases at Redeemer\u2019s University in Nigeria, said authorities are used to curbing outbreaks even without vaccines and credited the extensive networks of community health workers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always about how much money you have or how sophisticated your hospitals are,\u201d he said.\n\nDevi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said African leaders haven\u2019t gotten the credit they deserve for acting quickly, citing Mali\u2019s decision to close its borders before COVID-19 even arrived.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a different cultural approach in Africa, where these countries have approached COVID with a sense of humility because they\u2019ve experienced things like Ebola, polio and malaria,\u201d Sridhar said.\n\nIn past months, the coronavirus has pummeled South Africa and is estimated to have killed more than 89,000 people there, by far the most deaths on the continent. But for now, African authorities, while acknowledging that there could be gaps, are not reporting huge numbers of unexpected fatalities that might be COVID-related. WHO data show that deaths in Africa make up just 3% of the global total. In comparison, deaths in the Americas and Europe account for 46% and 29%.\n\nIn Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, the government has recorded nearly 3,000 deaths so far among its 200 million population. The U.S. records that many deaths every two or three days.\n\nThe low numbers have Nigerians like Opemipo Are, a 23-year-old in Abuja, feeling relieved. \u201cThey said there will be dead bodies on the streets and all that, but nothing like that happened,\u201d she said.\n\nOyewale Tomori, a Nigerian virologist who sits on several WHO advisory groups, suggested Africa might not even need as many vaccines as the West. It\u2019s an idea that, while controversial, he says is being seriously discussed among African scientists \u2014 and is reminiscent of the proposal British officials made last March to let COVID-19 freely infect the population to build up immunity.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that vaccines aren\u2019t needed in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe need to be vaccinating all out to prepare for the next wave,\u201d said Salim Abdool Karim, an epidemiologist at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, who previously advised the South African government on COVID-19. \u201cLooking at what\u2019s happening in Europe, the likelihood of more cases spilling over here is very high.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus has also been relatively muted in poor countries like Afghanistan, where experts predicted outbreaks amid ongoing conflict would prove disastrous.\n\nHashmat Arifi, a 23-year-old student in Kabul, said he hadn\u2019t seen anyone wearing a mask in months, including at a recent wedding he attended alongside hundreds of guests. In his university classes, more than 20 students routinely sit unmasked in close quarters.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any cases of corona lately,\u201d Arifi said. So far, Afghanistan has recorded about 7,200 deaths among its 39 million people, although little testing was done amid the conflict and the actual numbers of cases and deaths are unknown.\n\nBack in Zimbabwe, doctors were grateful for the respite from COVID-19 \u2014 but feared it was only temporary.\n\n\u201cPeople should remain very vigilant,\u201d warned Dr. Johannes Marisa, president of the Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association. He fears that another coronavirus wave would hit Zimbabwe next month. \u201cComplacency is what is going to destroy us because we may be caught unaware.\u201d",

          "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday he would repeal controversial farm laws that farmers have protested for more than a year, a significant climbdown for the combative leader.\n\nThe sudden concession on the three laws comes ahead of elections early next year in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state, and two other northern states with large rural populations.\n\n\u201cToday I have come to tell you, the whole country, that we have decided to withdraw all three agricultural laws,\u201d Modi said in an address to the nation.\n\n\u201cIn the parliament session starting later this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal these three agricultural laws.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, introduced in September last year, was aimed at deregulating the sector, allowing farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets, where growers are assured of a minimum price.\n\nFarmers, fearing the overhaul would cut the pries they get for their crops, staged nationwide protests that drew in activists and celebrities from outside India, including climate activist Greta Thunberg and U.S. singer Rihanna.\n\nModi\u2019s capitulation leaves unresolved a complex system of farm subsidies and price supports that critics say the government cannot afford. It could also raise questions for investors about how economic policy is being overwhelmed by political interests.\n\nMany of the biggest protests are centred around the capital New Delhi, where farmers have been camped by the roadside since last November, demanding the laws\u2019 repeal.\n\nRakesh Tikait, a farmers\u2019 group leader, said the protests were not being called off. \u201cWe will wait for parliament to repeal the laws,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government said last year that there was no question of repealing the laws. It attempted to break the impasse with farmer groups by offering to dilute the legislation, but protracted negotiations failed.\n\nVIOLENT TURN\n\nThe protests took a violent turn on Jan. 26, India\u2019s Republic Day, when thousands of farmers overwhelmed police and went on to storm the historic Red Fort in New Delhi after tearing down barricades and driving tractors through roadblocks.\n\nOne protester was killed and scores of farmers and policemen were injured.\n\nSmall farmers say the changes make them vulnerable to competition from big business and that they could eventually lose price support for staples such as wheat and rice.\n\nThe government says reform of the sector, which accounts for about 15% of the $2.7 trillion economy, means new opportunities and better prices for farmers.\n\nThe government failed to convince small groups of farmers of its intentions, Modi said in a speech after greeting the country on the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism.\n\nMany of the protesting farmers are Sikh.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the announcement made by the prime minister, but we need to know the government\u2019s stand on our other key demand of making (minimum support prices) compulsory for all crops,\u201d said Darshan Pal, another farmers\u2019 leader.\n\nMinimum support prices are state-set prices at which the government buys rice and wheat from farmers.\n\nThe expanded demand for minimum prices on all cropshas gained traction among farmers from across the country, not just the northern grain belt.\n\nOpposition parties congratulated the farmers. Rahul Gandhi of the Congress, India\u2019s main opposition party, said their firm stand forced the \u201carrogant\u201d government to concede.\n\n\u201cWhether it was fear of losing UP or finally facing up to conscience @BJP govt rolls back farm laws. Just the beginning of many more victories for people\u2019s voices.\u201d Mahua Moitra, a lawmaker from the Trinamool Congress Party and one of Modi\u2019s staunchest critics, said on Twitter\n\nGet Outlook for Android",

          "title": "Lagos Requires $15bn for Infrastructure, Governor Sanwo-Olu Says",
          "text": "Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Thursday disclosed that given the rising population and limited geographical space of the state, Lagos will require about $15 billion over the next five years for infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking at the third Lagos investors\u2019 roundtable and launch of a deal book organised by the Office of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Investment, Sanwo-Olu called on investors to optimise the advantages of the opportunities in Lagos State toward the goal of developing a 21st Century economy as projected by his administration.\n\nThe governor Sanwo-Olu also declared that the combined effects of climate and the security and economic challenges in northern Nigeria were putting pressure on the population of the state.\n\nAt the investment roundtable, which was attended by foreign diplomats, members of business communities, captains of industries and members of the State Executive Council, among others, Sanwo-Olu also called for partnership with investors and private sector, saying the implementation of the development strategies of his administration demands partnership and contributions of private investors.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe strongly believe that the continued growth and success of Lagos is premised on the strength and diversity of our partnerships. It is such strategic partnerships that account for Lagos being by far the leading recipient of local and foreign direct investments in Nigeria. It is estimated that, in the last few years, about 80 percent of the investments into Nigeria, has come into Lagos.\n\n\u201cThese investments remain vital to our economic growth and wellbeing, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and livelihoods across the city. This is the reason why a forum like this is so important \u2013 as a platform for harmonising our respective visions and targets and agreeing on key actions that will not only strengthen existing investment partnerships but also initiate new ones.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu stressed further that, \u201cAs a government, we understand the value of these relationships in fostering economic resilience, particularly during times of uncertainty, like this one we are in, marked by the combined effects of a global pandemic, climate change, global inflation, the burden of poverty and social and economic inequality, among others.\n\n\u201cAs a low-lying aquatic city with over 22 million citizens, confined to the smallest landmass in Nigeria, Lagos is especially vulnerable to all the challenges of a sprawling, densely populated, climate challenged, fast-growing Megacity.\n\n\u201cWe believe that given the rising population and limited geography space that we have, Lagos will indeed require about $15 billion over the next five years on infrastructure alone. $15 billion is about five times the budget that we currently have. Lagos budget is about $3 billion today.\u201d\n\nWhile assuring investors that Lagos was open and ready for investments, innovation and collaboration, Sanwo-Olu assured investors and private partners that the state government would create enabling policies and environment for them to thrive in Lagos and for their investments to be safe and secure, as well as ensuring that innovation thrives.\n\n\u201cIndeed we have a huge responsibility to develop critical hard and soft infrastructure that can act as a catalyst for what you do as investors. All of these we have been doing and will continue to do,\u201d the governor said.\n\nSanwo-Olu during the event also launched the \u2018Lagos Deal Book,\u2019 a compendium of investment opportunities across the state as well as information about the incentives for making the investments and the processes for doing so.\n\nHe said: \u201cI encourage you all to take advantage of the rich information contained in this Deal Book, to guide and inform your decision making. Information, they say, is power, and there is something of value and interest to each and every one of you, inside the compendium.\n\n\u201cI also urge you all to continue to support, partner and collaborate with Lagos State and with one another, to create sustainable economic prosperity that will touch the lives of all Lagosians. I would like to ask you all, to please spread the word; Lagos State is open and ready for investment, innovation, and collaboration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Special Adviser to Governor Sanwo-Olu on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and Investment, Mrs. Solape Hammond, said the roundtable was part of shared aspiration towards making Lagos the most preferred investment destination in the world.\n\nShe reassured the investors about the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration\u2019s determination to institute business-friendly measures to boost investors\u2019 confidence and guarantee trust, adding that her office is working with relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government to minimise all perceived threats and scale-up strategic benefits.\n\n\u201cIt is an incontrovertible fact that Lagos derived its age-long excellence partly from the worthy contribution of private investment to its socio-economic development, hence, the commitment towards creating a conducive atmosphere for private businesses to strive.\n\n\u201cAs carefully exemplified by Mr. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in his developmental agenda, T.H.E.M.E.S, the utmost goal is to make Lagos the most desirable investment destination in the world. The ability to attract investment remains the hallmark of healthy economies all over the world,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking, Commissioners for Transport (Dr. Frederick Oladeinde), Energy (Mr. Lere Odusote), Agriculture (Ms Bisola Olusanya), Tourism, Arts and Culture (Pharm. Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf), Health (Prof. Akin Abayomi), Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Infrastructure (Engr. Aramide Adeyoye) and Director-General, Office of Public Private Partnership (Mr. Ope George), who spoke passionately on huge investment opportunities in different sectors in the state and urged investors to tap into them.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "text": "The Commercial Operations Officer, Dangote Group, Mr. Rabiu Umar, on Thursday called for the reform at ports in Africa as well as the ease of regulations and bureaucracy that prevented free flow of trade across the continent in order to realise benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement.\n\nHe said this in an interview on The Morning Show, a breakfast programme of THISDAY\u2019s sister broadcast arm, Arise News Channel, on the sidelines of the ongoing Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF).\n\nHe stated that there was a renewed interest in Dangote group and Nigeria from other African countries.\n\nSpeaking on the benefits of the AfCFTA and how it would impact Dangote Group, \u201cThe trade barriers highlights a lot of issues around infrastructure, around diplomacy, around ports. For example, if you take the port situation, you may get your goods to the port and it takes such a long time. If I give the example of Nigeria to get them out of the country or into the country.\n\n\u201cI was on a panel Thursday and someone from South Africa said it\u2019s cheaper to move goods from Durban to China than from Durban to Cape Town. So, the challenges are not just related to a particular region, they\u2019re all across.\n\n\u201cBringing down these barriers will mean that goods and services can move much more freely and that will definitely give us a competitive advantage on the continent from one country to another.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing IATF meetings as it relates to Nigeria and Dangote Group, he said there was renewed interest in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think what has been impressive is the level of interest. From across the continent, many countries come in to find out what we do, trying to either sell us a solution, or try to buy something from us. I mean, we\u2019ve had all from all over I mean.\n\n\u201cWe have presence in 10 countries, like I said, including South Africa. So we had people come in, who are in South Africa to ask to do business with us. We have had people who want to know about our fertilizer business, for example, and all sorts and of course, the famous refinery, people are interested in finding out more and how they can collaborate and do business with us. So, it\u2019s been a worthwhile trip so far\u201d, he said.\n\nOn what should be done to boost Intra-African trade, he said fixing infrastructure, tariff reduction, ease of payments and settlements should be priority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult process. It is not just about the road transport or the quality of the roads you have. We don\u2019t have a rail system and of course, you know, road transportation is very expensive. The second part is the tariffs, the systems and the process, the bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cSo for us to get to where we need to get to, I think the key condition is to remove these barriers to trade, the biggest one being infrastructure, you need the infrastructure to move goods across the second part of it, you need to cut out the red tape, from a diplomatic perspective, from a customs perspective, from even a payment settlement perspective, which is one of the things the Afreximbank has done with the settlement system among the African countries meaning that you are kind of dollarising the economies of these countries\u201d, he said.",
