          "text": "The Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board has cleared Delta State University, Abraka of involvement in malpractice, a management source in the University has said.\n\nJUPEB\u2019s letter confirming the latest development is being expected to reach DELSU this week, PUNCH Metro gathered.\n\nThe official who craved anonymity, as he was not authorised to speak with journalists on the matter, disclosed on Monday evening that the delisting of DELSU from being an affiliated member and JUPEB\u2019s cancellation of the 2021 preliminary examinations held in the school over alleged widespread examination malpractices \u201cwas a miscarriage of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cJUPEB has reviewed the case and found out that DELSU was not among those involved in exam malpractice,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cDELSU has been absolved\u201d, he further stated explaining that \u201cthe institution (DELSU) is expecting JUPEB\u2019s letter confirming the latest development this week\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe letter may be available either tomorrow or next. So the anxiety over DELSU JUPEB is cleared. We were never involved in malpractice and we had to protest that there must be a miscarriage of justice\u201d, he submitted.\n\nAnother source said that the institution\u2019s JUPEB Director did not attend the virtual meeting where the delisting decision was reached and so there was nobody to speak for the institution at that forum.\n\n\u201cThe matter has been treated. We were never involved in malpractice,\u201d the source insisted.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that JUPEB had after a virtual meeting, addressed a letter dated January 25, 2022, to DELSU\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Andy Ogochukwu Egwunyenga.\n\nThat letter read partly, \u201cFollowing the report received from the investigative panel regarding the conduct of the 2021 JUPEB examinations, the academic board and the JUPEB governing board approved that the indicted universities be delisted as an affiliate member of JUPEB for five years and the results of the examinations conducted in these universities be cancelled due to widespread malpractices\u201d.\n\nIt read further, \u201cDelta State University is one of the indicted universities hence, the Vice-Chancellor is hereby notified of the approval of JUPEB governing board.\n\n\u201cThe governing board of JUPEB is also displeased with this outcome of the event, which was due to poor conduct of examinations in the university. The governing board of JUPEB at an emergency meeting held on January 25, 2022, has, therefore, directed that all students currently registered for 2021/2022 session of the programme in your university be moved to the nearest affiliate university to write the 2022 JUPEB examinations.\n\n\u201dThe Vice-Chancellor is expected to decide and communicate to the registrar JUPEB, the nearby JUBEB approved university where the registered students can complete the programme studies and write 2022 examinations.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

And so as a senator from north central, I am very worried that you are nominated to represent north-central, the people that know said you are not from north central.\n\n\u201cYou seem to be highly educated as a young man.

My family immigrated to Kwara in 1983. I and my siblings were all born in Kwara. We have lived there all through our lives.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the process to make us indigenes of Kwara commenced and we have the documentation in the file attached.

What matters is the content you have and how well you can represent this country.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, that is a very frivolous petition and we hereby dismiss the petition on ground of lack of merit.\u201d\n\nOther nominees are Mr Chidi Ike (South East), Mr Nathan Shatti (North East) and Mr Dafe Akpeneye (South-South).\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Reactions have started to trail the alleged exchange of gunshots on Monday between the security escort of Rauf Aregbesola, former governor of the state and current Minister of Interior, and armed thugs.\n\nA journalist and social commentator in a radio current affairs programme monitored on Tuesday, Ayo Ologun, stated that while the disagreement between the former governor and his successor, Adegboyega Oyetola revolved around the ego of the former.\n\nOlogun, while lamenting the shootings, stressed that the former governor had part ways with his successor and adopted another aspirant as his anointed candidate cannot introduce violence to the state he intends to govern.\n\nHe revealed that as a result of the shootings which occurred in Osogbo on Monday evening, innocent individuals suffered.\n\nThe social crusader maintained that the action was uncalled for and it was not what the state needed at this critical time.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere are questions to be asked if you use state powers to terrorise the people you seek to govern.\u201d\n\nAs to the report of the police declaring that 13 spent cartridges of G-3 and AK-47 assault rifles were recovered from the scene of the shootings after the minister departed, Ologun asked the police to carry out a comprehensive investigation to determine the source of the bullets.\n\nOlogun declared that the situation of buck-passing and disagreement between separate security agencies was not enough proof as the expended shells recovered from the scene of the shooting was enough evidence to nail those behind the shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate chat with DAILY POST, Ologun noted that \u201cIt is unfortunate that at a time like this in the polity of the state, political players are introducing a dimension that is almost becoming alien in the political history of the state.\n\n\u201cThe way at which things stand, one is quickly reminded of the situation pre the advent of the Aregbesola\u2019s administration when he held the state down in perpetual violence against then-incumbent, Olagunsoye Oyinlola.\n\n\u201cFor political watchers and analysts, it is the same script of then playing out. From the attack on the Oranmiyan house to the diverse claims of assassination here and there.\n\n\u201cIn all of this, it is pertinent to call on all political players to play according to the rules in ensuring that the peace of the state is sacredly protected.\n\n\u201cTheir politics is not worth the blood of any resident of the state and hence should know that they can\u2019t afford to terrorise the same people they plan to govern. Osun has been relatively peaceful and such virtue should be upheld.\u201d\n\nWaheed Saka, the convener of Dialogue 360, stated that the former Osun governor had crossed the line this time around.\n\nSaka, who revealed that he is a staunch follower of Aregbesola, stated that at this time in the history of the state, there was no need for violence as everyone needed to adopt peace so that all can move forward.\n\nJare Ismail Tiamiyu, an Osogbo based media practitioner in his Facebook post stated that \u201cOsun: It\u2019s between Aregbesola and Tinubu. The game is getting interesting!\n\n\u201cI hope all APC guys who attacked us in 2020 and early 2021 when we said there was a crisis between Oyetola and Aregbesola, will apologise to us now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a full-blown crisis now.\u201d\n\nLamina Kamiludeen Omotoyosi, the Founder of the World Institute for Peace, stated that the shooting in Osogbo on Monday by armed men who were in the company of the former governor Rauf Aregbesola was nothing but a misplacement of priority.\n\nOmotoyosi, who recalled that the minister once governed the state for two terms, reminded him that he should know that nothing is sweeter than peace in any given society.\n\nHe called on the former governor to apologise to the Osun people as some of them were injured while running for their lives during Monday\u2019s shooting incident.\n\nIn his words, \u201cI am not giving any judgement though, but the shooting was huge and caused a lot of panic. It is unfair sir.\u201d\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the convoy of Rauf Aregbesola was allegedly attacked by gunmen suspected to be led by one Asiri Eniba who has been linked to the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nAlso as a result of the shootings, there has been a war of words between the state government and the faction of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State.\n\nWhile the state government alleged that it has reports of cowards invading Osogbo, the state capital, the APC faction alleged that the attack on the convoy of the minister was intended to kill him.\n\nThe Osun State Police Command and the Osun State Command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have also disagreed as to the origin of the shooting and for whom it was intended.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nWith the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) drawing near, the race for the chairmanship position may have been narrowed to three contenders.\n\nThe APC National Executive Council (NEC) had in June 2020 appointed Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, as acting national chairman, pending the holding of a national convention. Prior to being named for the position, Governor Buni had served as national secretary of the party.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nSources told Daily Sun that the three favoured candidates are Alhaji Umaru Tanko Al-Makura, former governor of Nasarawa State and now senator representing Nasarawa South; Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, ex-governor of Nasarawa State and senator representing Nasarawa West; and Alhaji Sani Musa, senator representing Niger East.\n\nIt was gathered that supporters and bigwigs of the defunct Congress for Progressives Change (CPC) are rooting for Al-Makura who was first elected governor on the platform of CPC in 2011.\n\nThe CPC elements supporting Al-Makura, it was gathered, are pushing for him as they suspect that the presidential candidate of the APC would not come from their fold and therefore want one of their own to be the national chairman to ensure they remain relevant in the party. President Buhari is of the CPC bloc.\n\nAl-Makura\u2019s alleged closeness to former Lagos State governor, Senator Bola Tinubu, who has declared his intention to contest the 2023 president ticket under the APC, is however, being used against him by those opposing his aspiration.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that governors in the APC, determined to maintain a grip on the party, favour Senator Adamu.\n\n\u201cThe governors want to position themselves to play a leading role in the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate later this year,\u201d a source said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

Sources say each of the group is trying to get President Buhari\u2019s support and endorsement.\n\nHowever, owing to the CPC connection, Al-Makura\u2019s supporters are confident that President Buhari may give his nod for his emergence as national chairman.\n\nThe APC leadership crisis started when former national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, was forced to step aside following a court judgment suspending him from office.\n\nA High Court of the Federal Capital territory (FCT) in March 2020 had ordered the suspension of Oshiomhole following an application by Mustapha Salihu and five others.",

          "text": "By Emma Njoku and Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nSuspended Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force, DCP Abba Kyari, was arrested yesterday over alleged involvement in a 25 kilograms cocaine deal.\n\nNational Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Director, Media and Advocacy, Mr. Femi Bababafemi, who made the disclosure in a statement, yesterday, said the embattled deputy commissioner of police was arrested by the Nigeria Police Force and handed over to the anti-narcotic agency.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\n\u201cFew hours after he was declared wanted by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA over his involvement in a 25 kilograms Cocaine deal, the Nigerian Police Force has handed over the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force, to the anti-narcotic agency,\u201d Babafemi said in the statement.\n\nThe statement added that Kyari was arrested alongside four other wanted suspects, namely: ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu, and were driven into the National Headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja, at about 5pm, yesterday, for interrogation and further investigation.\n\nThe agency assured that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that all suspects already in custody and those that may still be indicted in the course of investigation will face the full weight of the law at the end of the ongoing probe.\n\nDeclaring Kyari wanted at a media briefing earlier yesterday, in Abuja, Babafemi said: \u201cWith the intelligence at our disposal, the agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that crop up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. His failure to cooperate forced the hand of the agency and that is the reason for this press briefing.\n\n\u201cLet me give a synopsis of what transpired.\n\nThe saga started on Friday, January 21, 2022, when DCP Kyari initiated a call to one of the NDLEA officers in Abuja, at 2:12 pm. When the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service.\n\n\u201cHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine. He proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu. In the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command, to play along as well.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cNow, anybody who is in touch with the reality of the renewed drug war by NDLEA since January 18, 2021, would know that that was a tall order because our officers and men have rededicated themselves to the war against illicit drugs and what Kyari was asking for was not tenable, not in this new dispensation, not with the new NDLEA. We can recall that one of our officers was in the same situation in May 2021 when a drug kingpin, Ejiofor Felix Enwereaku, flew from Brazil to Nigeria to negotiate the release of a 27.95 kg shipment of cocaine intercepted at the MMIA. The drug lord offered a bribe of $24, 500, but our officer placed duty above pecuniary interest. We all know how the episode ended.\n\nThat is the ethos of the new NDLEA. And our officer proved it again this time by reporting to the authorities.\n\nBy 11:05 am on Monday, January 24, after the agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u201ctheir\u201d willingness to play the game.\n\nAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and he and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg which was already sold. He then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg. At N7 million per kilogram, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35 million, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team. He put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\nThe next day, January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men deliver the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was, therefore, prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\n\nAnd by 5:23pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting. In their discussion, he disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, showing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how, acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies. He also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots. The reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test. He forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package. According to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\nHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61, 400.

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike and Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has declared a four-week industrial action to press home its demands for improved condition of service for members.\n\nIts President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, at a press conference, yesterday, said the decision formed part of the resolution from meetings held by the union\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) between February 12 and 13.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nHe said after the expiration of the four weeks strike, NEC would meet to take its next line of action. ASUU opted for the industrial action following failure of the Federal Government to fully implement the union\u2019s outstanding demands dating to 13 years, he said.\n\nHe listed failure to implement the Memorandum of Action signed with the union on December 23, 2020; non-signing of the 2009 renegotiated FGN/ASUU agreement submitted nine months ago; forceful payment of ASUU members\u2019 salaries and emoluments through the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) and non-adoption of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), which government have used to shortage its members, as reasons for the strike.\n\nSaid Osodeke: \u201cNEC resolved to embark on a four-week roll-over total and comprehensive strike beginning from Monday, February 14, 2022. Contrary to the views canvassed in some quarters, our union loathes to disrupt academic activities on our campus. We love our students and respect their parents and guardians. We are also not insensitive to the genuine concerns about stable academic calendars in public universities expressed by patriotic Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe blamed the strike on those who ignored the union\u2019s patriotic yearnings for a development-oriented education in the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe patience of our members has been tasked beyond tolerable limits. We, therefore, seek the understanding and support of all stakeholders to make Nigerian government more responsive to issues of human capital development including health and education.\u201d\n\nHe said the union wrote over 30 letters, met with the Senate president, Speaker of House of Representatives, traditional and other stakeholders on how to resolve the issues.\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has declared the professorship of Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, illegal.\n\nThe union said his promotion to that rank by the Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) did not follow due process.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be a minister and a lecturer in a university. It is an encouragement of illegality. Pantami has to quit as a minister and be tried for doing double jobs within the same federal system. He is not qualified. Pantami should not be treated as a professor.\n\n\u201cIn September 2021, Pantami, alongside seven academics were elevated by the council of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri to the position of professorship at the council\u2019s 186th meeting.The minister\u2019s elevation has generated controversy, with many faulting FUTO on the promotion of the minister, who was not teaching in the university and whose highest academic attainment was reportedly a lecturer before he ventured into politics. We have resolved to sanction ASUU members involved in his promotion and the VC of FUTO.\u201d",

It was not a matter between the Aniomas and the Ijaws. It was not based on any condition other than competence, equity and, fair play.\n\n\u201cSome of us championed the cause of Delta North producing the governor of Delta State in 2015 for inclusiveness and unity of the state.\u201d\n\nChief Clark further said: \u201cFor record purposes, I would like to mention how in 2014, His Majesty, Prof Edozien, the Asagba of Asaba, accompanied by 11 traditional rulers of Anioma extraction with Chief Benjamin Elue, former deputy governor of Delta State, as Anioma Congress secretary, came to pay me a visit, requesting that an Anioma indigene be considered for the governorship of Delta state in 2015, and to support them in their demand for Anioma State.\n\n\u201cProf Edozien after our discussions, invited me to Asaba, to attend a mega rally organised at the Cenotaph, Asaba. I was the guest of honour, in order to identify with the Anioma, I dressed in Anioma attire. When it was my turn to speak in reply to their address, I assured them that I will support their request, and will see that it is realised.\n\n\u201cAt a subsequent meeting, with the then governor of Delta State, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, I discussed the matter with him and we agreed that the Delta North should produce the gubernatorial candidate of PDP in 2015, for proper integration in the state.\n\n\u201cThat was the reason why we recommended Dr Steve Oru to replace Godsday Orubebe as a Minister representing Delta State in Dr Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government, instead of Dr Cairo Ojougboh who is also from Anioma. Dr Ojougboh then took Dr Oru\u2019s position as the Vice Chairman of the PDP in South-South.\n\n\u201cI will like to state with the greatest respect that the main beneficiaries of these series of interactions is our competent and intelligent governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, the incumbent Governor of Delta state\n\n\u201cIt is at this juncture that Government Ekpemupolo, alias Tompolo, came to me in Abuja, where we decided to adopt the candidature of Dr Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\n\u201cThe arrangement for Okowa to become PDP gubernatorial candidate in Delta State with Otuaro as his deputy was finally sealed in my house.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says he\u2019s focused on supporting FG\u2019s economic recovery drive\n\n\u2022Insists it is only God that anoints leaders\n\nBy Obinna Chima\n\nIn reaction to speculations around his purported interest in the 2023 presidential race which has seen stampede by vested parties and interest, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele yesterday said it was the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession plan in line with global best practice, for good governance and continuing peace and progress of the country.\n\nEmefiele also stressed that he remained focused on his job, even as he has pledged to continue supporting the Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive.\n\nThese formed part of a statement titled; Who is Afraid of Emefiele? from the group known as \u2018FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE,\u2019 who disclosed that they met with the CBN governor to clarify his position on the 2023 presidential race.\n\nEmefiele, according to the group, also warned those that had resorted to all sorts of blackmail, sponsored articles and choreographed comments on social media targeted at tainting his image, impugning his character and legacy to desist from such act, stressing that it\u2019s God that anoints leaders and that he would leave his faith firmly in the hands of God.\n\nThe statement noted that in the past few weeks, there have been media reports on Emefiele\u2019s purported interest in the 2023 presidential race, leading to some interested parties and vested interests resorting to all sorts of blackmail, sponsored articles and choreographed comments on social media targeted at tainting Emefiele\u2019s image, impugning his character and legacy.\n\nIt pointed out that the negative attacks were being sponsored by those who see Emefiele as a major threat to their political ambition.\n\n\u201cTruth is Godwin Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone he is running for President even as he is constitutionally qualified to do so; he has been under pressure in the past few weeks as different groups have been putting up unsolicited campaign for his candidacy.\n\n\u201cOnly yesterday, as the speculation became widespread, a group of his friends under the aegis of FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE met with him to clarify his position. Here is what he told us:\n\n\u201cThat he remains focused on his job and will continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive; that in his career trajectory, right from his days as a young banker, he never asked, nor lobbied for a job, he was invited by the Board of Directors to be the Chief Executive Officer/Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank as he was an integral part of the team, led by founder Jim Ovia, that transformed Zenith Bank from a start-up to one of Africa\u2019s largest banks with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, South Africa, Dubai, China and the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nIt further pointed out that in 2014, President Goodluck Jonathan tapped him to be the CBN Governor, a job he didn\u2019t lobby for and in which his name was not among those being considered at that time and was not even from the geo-political zone that most people thought the job would go to as the president then was from same geopolitical zone with him.\n\nIt further quoted Emefiele to have said he, \u201cremains humbled by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant him an unprecedented second term as CBN Governor- again without lobbying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus he will continue to remain loyal to him and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Mr. Emefiele told us that he believes it\u2019s the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession in line with global best practices for good governance for the continuing peace and progress of the federal republic of Nigeria, as such he will play his part to stabilise the economy for an orderly transition.\n\n\u201cAnd given that it\u2019s God that anoints leaders, he will leave his faith firmly in the hands of God. With these fundamental questions settled, it is imperative to address some of the lies and utter falsehood being peddled by blackmailers and political jobbers who see Godwin Emefiele as a threat to their ambition,\u201d it stated.\n\nHighlighting his achievements since he assumed office in June 2014, they noted that then, his task was huge and the challenges seemed insurmountable, adding that today he has calmed the waters and put Nigeria back on the path of growth.\n\n\u201cAs you will recall there was a sharp fall in crude oil prices from 2015, which led to significant revenue shortfalls in Nigeria where crude oil represents about 95 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s export revenue. This created major shock for the Nigerian economy, leading to a 13-month recession in 2016.\n\n\u201cIn comparison to the previous years before Emefiele became the CBN governor, the average price of crude oil from 2010 to 2014 was over $100/barrel and this fell to some $30 / barrel with high production costs of some $25/barrel.\n\n\u201cDespite these challenges Emefiele\u2019s monetary policies supported the Buhari administration and all 36 State governments, ensuring salaries were paid and much more was done, with much less, in infrastructure, steering Nigeria away from much worse outcomes while many oil producers like Kuwait, Russia, Angola and Brunei had longer lasting recessions between of 20 \u2013 60 months,\u201d it stated.\n\nAdditionally, FRIENDS OF EMEFIELE urged critics to also understand that the second recession the country entered into in 2020 was as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThen, the global economy (Nigeria inclusive) was plunged into recession because of the pandemic which was unprecedented. It led to declines in economic activities and lockdown across the world.\n\nThey pointed out that countries such as the United States had their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) falling in 2020 by -31 per cent in the second quarter (Q2) of that year; the United Kingdom by -19.4 per cent in Q2; European Union by -14.1 per cent in Q2 and Nigeria, with deft response of the CBN had -6.1 per cent in Q2.\n\n\u201cAs we all know the CBN supported fiscal authorities in the following areas. N100 billion health sector credit facility for operators in the sector. Today, Nigeria boasts of two world-class cancer centres in Lagos and medical tourism has reduced.\n\n\u201cA one-year extension of a moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facilities; the reduction of the interest rate on intervention loans from nine per cent to five per cent; strengthening of the loan-to-deposit ratio policy (i.e. stepped up enforcement of directive to extend more credit to the private sector),\u201d it stated.\n\nThe group listed other measures introduced by the Emefiele-led CBN to include the creation of N400 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises; granting regulatory forbearance to banks to restructure terms of facilities in affected sectors; improving FX supply to the CBN by directing oil companies and oil servicing companies to sell FX to the CBN rather than the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and additional N100 billion intervention fund in healthcare loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners intending to expand/build capacity.\n\nThe group added: \u201cDespite the challenges, the CBN under Emefiele has in the last seven years maintained a developmental-oriented approach in supporting the federal government to address challenges across various sectors of the economy and has initiated far-reaching reforms.\n\n\u201cOne issue the critics have continued to raise is the issue of the rice pyramid which was recently unveiled in Abuja. But these arm chair critics have failed to understand that through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), an initiative that was introduced by the Emefiele-led CBN, the lives of a lot of rural farmers have been transformed.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramid which had taken place previously in Minna, Kebbi, Gombe, Ekiti and Abuja, showed how Emefiele has used agriculture to support the federal government\u2019s wars on insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramids were build bag by bag in all the states the programme had been launched since December 2020, when it was first launched in Minna, Niger State. The programme held last month to unveil the world\u2019s largest rice pyramid in Abuja was also an initiative of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN).\u201d\n\nIt noted that from an average yield of 1.8 metric tonnes per hectare in the pre-ABP era, the initiative has increased the country\u2019s average yield per hectare for rice paddy and maize to about five metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant reduction in the country\u2019s rice import bill, from a monstrous $1.05 billion prior to November 2015, to the current figure of $18.50 million, annually, the group noted.\n\n\u201cEmefiele also spearheaded the creation of the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), an initiative that brought all the private sector business leaders under an umbrella in the fight against the spread of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis was why in its latest Article IV Consultation released in February 2022, the International Monetary Fund praised Nigeria\u2019s effort in fighting the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThere are many other measures announced by the CBN Governor which will be detailed in due course like the support to Technology, Digital innovation, the Creative Industries and the 15 Trillion Infrastructure corporation recently launched.\n\n\u201cApparently, those behind the sponsored negative reports are afraid of Emefiele\u2019s towering personality and service to Nigeria. But they must understand that he cannot be stampeded any way.

          "text": "\u2022Police say interim investigation established strong ties between drug couriers, NDLEA officers\n\n\u2022Want drug law agency officers to investigate indicted officers\n\nMichael Olugbode in Maiduguri and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nFew hours after he was declared wanted by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) over involvement in a cocaine deal, suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari was yesterday handed over by the police to the anti-narcotics agency.\n\nKyari had solved many criminal cases and was until recently among the most celebrated police officers in the country. But he found himself in troubled waters when he was associated with Hushpuppi\u2019s cybercrime case. An American court ordered his deportation to the United States to be prosecuted along with Abbas Ramon, alias Hushpuppi, a request the Nigerian government was yet to respond to.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of NDLEA, Mr. Femi Babafemi, disclosed that the police handed over the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigeria Police to the drug law enforcement agency. Babafemi also disclosed that alongside Kyari, four other suspects in the matter, namely, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba; and Inspector John Nuhu, were driven into the headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja about 5pm yesterday and formally hand them over for interrogation and further investigation.\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman stated, \u201cThe agency wishes to assure that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that all suspects already in custody and those that may still be indicted in the course of investigation will face the full weight of the law at the end of the on-going probe.\u201d\n\nEarlier, NDLEA had declared the suspended Kyari wanted for running a drug cartel.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, where he equally presented video evidence showing the culpability of Kyari in illicit drug business, Babafemi said Nigerians needed to be reminded of the enormity of the drug challenge the country faced and how imperative it was for all well-meaning citizens to play a positive role in curbing the illicit drug menace.\n\nHe said though the war by the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari against drug was uncompromising, \u201cunfortunately, some law enforcement agents who should be partners in the pursuit of the president\u2019s mandate are at the forefront of breaking the law, as they aid and abet drug trafficking in the country.\n\n\u201cToday, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\u201d\n\nBabafemi added, \u201cWith the intelligence at our disposal, the agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that crop up in an on-going drug case in which he is the principal actor. His failure to cooperate forced the hand of the agency and that is the reason for this press briefing.\u201d\n\nHe also explained, \u201cLet me give a synopsis of what transpired. The saga started on Friday, January 21, 2022, when DCP Kyari initiated a call to one of the NDLEA officers in Abuja at 2:12 pm. When the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service.\n\n\u201cHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine. He proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command to play along as well.\u201d\n\nBabafemi continued, \u201cBy 11: 05 am on Monday, January 24, after the agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u2018their\u2019 willingness to play the game.\n\n\u201cAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and he and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg, which was already sold. He then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg.\n\n\u201cAt N7 million per kilogramme, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35 million, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team.\n\n\u201cHe put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\n\u201cThe next day, January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men delivered the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was therefore prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\u201d\n\nAccording to Babafemi, by 5: 23 pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting.\n\nHe stated that in their discussion, Kyari disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, \u201cshowing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies.\u201d\n\nHe also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test,\u201d Babafemi said. \u201cHe forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package,\u201d he added.\n\nHe revealed further, \u201cAccording to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\n\u201cHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61,400. Our officer, however, preferred to take the money inside his car. Well, the car was wired with sound and video recorders. And the moment was documented.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said the NDLEA had a trove of intelligence, hard facts, from chats to photos and video and a detailed transcript of the communication between Kyari and officers of the agency.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is not the place to delve into the details. But it is disheartening to hear straight from the horse\u2019s mouth the kind of sleaze engaged in by this team of rogue law enforcement agents led by Kyari, the members of whom he described this way: \u2018the boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal.\u2019\u201d\n\nBabafemi said it was disheartening to hear Kyari referred to this rogue team in narrative, thus, \u201cI do take good care of them, and this kind of work is done by only that team.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is equally disheartening to hear him give details of another similar operation which they pulled off, three weeks ago, according to him.\u201d\n\nHe revealed, \u201cDCP Abba Kyari was invited by NDLEA for debriefing on Thursday February 10 through two main channels because there is a whole lot of questions begging for answers. The invitation was legitimate and formal according to our protocol. But up till the close of office hours on Friday, February 11, he refused to respond. Up till this moment, he hasn\u2019t responded.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman said, \u201cKyari must be debriefed before the suspects are arraigned in court. Having failed to honour the official invitation, NDLEA has no option but to declare DCP Abba Kyari of the Nigerian Police wanted, right from this very moment\u2026\n\n\u201cI must say this publicly. We are not unaware of threats to the lives of NDLEA officers involved in this investigation, even as we continue to do our best to protect our officers and men in the line of duty.\n\n\u201cWe are making this strong statement to those contemplating harmful action against NDLEA officers. They would only succeed in compounding their problems in the event of the murder of or harm to officers and men of NDLEA.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the media briefing, the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, ordered the arrest of Kyari and the other suspects. Baba also charged the NDLEA to investigate the indicted officers of the agency involved in the alleged crime.\n\nThe police in a statement revealed, \u201cIn line with standard administrative procedure of the force, the Inspector General of Police ordered a high-level, discreet, and in-house investigation into the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe interim investigations report revealed that two international drug couriers identified as Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus, both males, were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu on the 19th of January, 2022, upon their arrival from Addis Ababa aboard an Ethiopian Airlines flight ET917.\n\n\u201cThe arrest led to the recovery of substantial quantity of powdery substance suspected to be cocaine from the two narcotic couriers. The operation, which was intelligence-driven, was undertaken by a unit of the Police Intelligence Response Team.\n\n\u201cAlthough the case and the two suspects were subsequently transferred to the NDLEA on the 25th January, 2022, the findings of the in-house investigation ordered by the Inspector General of Police established reasonable grounds for strong suspicion that the IRT officers involved in the operation could have been involved in some underhand and unprofessional dealings as well as official corruption which compromised ethical standards in their dealings with the suspects and exhibits recovered.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Olumuyiwa Adejobi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), added, \u201cBeyond this, the police investigation also established that the international narcotics cartel involved in this case have strong ties with some officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu who are on their pay roll.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers confirmed that the modus is for the transnational drug barons to conspire with the NDLEA officers on duty and send them their pre-boarding photographs for identification, seamless clearance, and unhindered passage out of the airport with the narcotics being trafficked.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers also confirmed that they have been enjoying this relationship with the NDLEA officers at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport since 2021 and had in this instant case of 19th January, 2022, been identified and cleared by the NDLEA officers as customary, having received their pre-departure photographs and other details prior to their arrival in Enugu, and were on their way out with the narcotics when they were apprehended by the police.\n\n\u201cThe police investigations report also indicted DCP Abba Kyari, who had been on suspension for his alleged involvement in a different fraud case being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), for complicity in the allegation of official corruption, tampering with narcotics exhibit and sundry unprofessional conducts that negate the standard administrative and investigative protocols of the force as well as extant criminal laws.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s involvement in these allegation occurred while his suspension from service was subsisting\u201d, it said.\n\n\u201cOn the strength of the findings of the in-house police investigation panel, the Inspector-General of Police has ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of all the indicted police officers to the NDLEA authorities for conclusive investigation, while appropriate disciplinary actions are also being initiated against them by the Force leadership.\u201d\n\nThe police high command added: \u201cThe IGP has also formally requested that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency should ensure the identification, arrest and investigation of the agency\u2019s officers, who have also been found to be colluding with the international drug cartel involved in this case towards advancing the anti-narcotics agenda of the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe IGP assures the public of his administration\u2019s commitment to upholding the tenets and values of policing in line with the agenda of ethical regeneration, restoration of professional standard, enhancement of the anti-corruption drive, respect for the rule of law and inter-agency collaboration in the drive to stabilise the internal security order of the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Still caught in the middle of a police probe that has lasted over five months and possible extradition to the US over his alleged involvement with Hushpuppi, a self-confessed internet fraudster, Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP), is in the news again.\n\nKyari may not have foreseen his recent arrest over alleged links to a \u201ccocaine deal\u201d. Less than three weeks ago, he was in high spirits while attending the wedding ceremony of the son of the inspector-general of police (IGP) in Borno.\n\nOn Monday, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) declared the super cop wanted \u201cover his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal\u201d. Hours later, the police announced his arrest and subsequent transfer to the NDLEA\u2019s custody.\n\nThe developments have been coming in rapidly \u2014 and these are what the police and the NDLEA have so far revealed about the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn January 19, 2022, two \u201cinternational drug couriers\u201d, Chibunna Patrieck Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus, were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu upon arrival from Ethiopia.\n\nThe arrest was carried out by a unit of the police intelligence response team (IRT). Kyari headed the IRT before he was suspended over the Hushpuppi matter .\n\n. On January 21, Kyari was said to have met an NDLEA operative in Abuja, informing the latter that the suspects arrested by the IRT in Enugu were found with 25kg of cocaine.\n\nKyari proposed that the seized cocaine be divided into two parts \u2014 15kg and 10kg. His plan was that NDLEA would use 10kg to prosecute the suspects, while Kyari/IRT unit/\u201dinformants\u201d would take 15kg. The 15kg cocaine taken out would be replaced with \u201cdummies\u201d.\n\nThree days after the meeting, the NDLEA operative was directed to play along and agree that the cocaine should be shared as suggested by Kyari.\n\nWhen the NDLEA was ready to play ball, Kyari said the 15kg cocaine had already been shared \u2014 informants took 7kg and Kyari\u2019s \u201cteam\u201d got 8kg. But he had another request. The suspended DCP offered to sell 5kg from the remaining seized cocaine and pay the money to the NDLEA operative and FCT commander \u2014 Kyari expected that the FCT command would be involved in the deal.\n\nThe 5kg that would be sold was expected to fetch N35 million \u2013 at N7 million per kilogramme. The money would be delivered in dollars (at N570 black market exchange rate) and Kyari offered to deliver $61,400 to the NDLEA operative.\n\nWhile the dollars-for-5kg cocaine deal was in play, \u201cKyari\u2019s men\u201d arrived in Abuja and were awaiting his go-ahead to deliver the suspects, the remaining 5kg original cocaine and the 20kg \u201cdummies\u201d. Kyari was said to be in Lagos at this time.\n\nOn January 25, Kyari asked if his younger brother could deliver the $61,400, while his \u201cmen\u201d would bring the suspects, but the NDLEA operative insisted on dealing with the suspended DCP personally.\n\nAt 5:23pm on January 25, Kyari was back in Abuja for a rendezvous with the NDLEA operative.\n\nKyari told the NDLEA operative that the remaining 5kg of original cocaine would come in packages \u201cmarked with red dots\u201d, to differentiate them from the \u201cdummies\u201d and to ensure the right substance is tested. He also sent a photograph of the marked packages.\n\nThe $61,400 from the sale of the extra 5kg of cocaine was delivered at the Abuja spot, but the NDLEA officer insisted that the money exchange hands in the latter\u2019s car \u2014 the vehicle had been fitted with recording devices prior to the meeting.\n\nSixteen days later, on February 10, the NDLEA invited Kyari for questioning. On February 14, \u201cafter he failed to show up\u201d, he was declared wanted.\n\nAccording to the IGP, the investigation carried out by the police revealed that \u201cthe international narcotics cartel involved in the case has strong ties with some NDLEA officers who are on their payroll\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari was arrested alongside four other officers \u2014 Sunday Ubuah, Bawa James, Simon Agrigba and John Nuhu. One John Umoru, identified as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), is said to be at large.",

          "title": "Facebook under fire for poor treatment of African content moderators",
          "text": "Meta-owned Facebook has come under fire for the treatment of African content moderators according to a recent TIME article.\n\nTIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s Sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019. Sama also provides data labeling services for tech giants like Google, Microsoft.\n\nIn 2021, Facebook said it spent more than $5 billion on safety measures. It contracts the services of more than 15,000 content moderators globally, most of whom are employed by third-parties like Sama.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is a kind of mental torture,\u201d one employee, who currently works as a Facebook content moderator for Sama, told TIME. \u201cWhatever I am living on is hand-to-mouth. I can\u2019t save a cent. Sometimes I feel I want to resign. But then I ask myself: what will my baby eat?\u201d\n\nThese working conditions led 6 Ethiopians to resign in January. Recall that Facebook is struggling to reduce the influence of content on its platform which is leading to real-world violence in Ethiopia. According to TIME, at least two Sama content moderators resigned after being diagnosed with mental illnesses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Many others described how they had been traumatized by the work but were unable to obtain formal diagnoses due to their inability to afford access to quality mental healthcare. Some described continuing with work despite trauma because they had no other options.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, instead of negotiating when content moderators threatened to strike unless they were given better pay and working conditions, Sama responded by flying two highly-paid executives from San Francisco to Nairobi to deal with the uprising.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, the attempted strike\u2019s leader who was in the process of formally filing trade union papers, was fired shortly after. He was accused by Sama of taking action that would put the relationship between the company and Facebook at \u201cgreat risk.\u201d Sama told other participants in the labor action effort that they were expendable and said they should either resign or get back to work, several employees told TIME. The workers abandoned the protest before the seven days were up, and there was no pay increase.\n\nSama denied that there was any strike or labor action.\n\nAccording to payslips seen by TIME, Sama pays foreign employees monthly pre-tax salaries of around 60,000 Kenyan shillings ($528), which includes a monthly bonus for relocating from elsewhere in Africa. After tax, this equates to around $440 per month, or a take-home wage of roughly $2.20 per hour, based on a 45-hour work week. Sama employees from within Kenya, who are not paid the monthly relocation bonus, receive a take-home wage equivalent to around $1.46 per hour after tax.\n\nThe average salary at Sama including benefits was approximately 2.5 times the Kenyan minimum wage, according to a 2021 study carried out by three MIT researchers. But these wages only cover the basic costs of living, workers say, and don\u2019t allow them to save or improve their financial situations.\n\nEmployees also complained of working long hours\u2014up to nine hours per day including breaks, and their screen time is monitored. According to several copies of Sama content moderators\u2019 performance reviews, TIME revealed that the moderators were measured against target metrics for average time spent and quality. This evidence contradicts the public statement that Facebook has made about not setting expectations on its contractors.\n\n\u201cA common misconception about content reviewers is that they\u2019re driven by quotas and pressured to make hasty decisions,\u201d Ellen Silver, Facebook\u2019s vice president of operations, said in a 2018 blog post. \u201cLet me be clear: content reviewers aren\u2019t required to evaluate any set number of posts \u2026 We encourage reviewers to take the time they need.\u201d\n\nA Meta spokesperson, Ben Walters, corroborated this statement.\n\nThe Social media giant has also put some features in place to help protect moderators, like the option to render videos in black and white or add blurring. But one Sama employee said he doesn\u2019t use these options because of the pressure to meet quotas. \u201cHow can you clearly see whether content is violating or not unless you can see it clearly? If it\u2019s black and white or blurred, I cannot tell,\u201d the employee said. \u201cSome people use the option, but I don\u2019t. Because if I wrongly action that [content], I will be marked down.\u201d\n\nThis report adds to a seemingly endless series of public controversies relating to Facebook in recent years. Despite claiming innocence in this case, it\u2019s imperative the social media giant holds its contractors like Sama to higher standards or else its name will be dragged in the mud.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "YC\u2019s backing of its first Namibian startup shows investors are paying attention to the country",
          "text": "When the COVID lockdown was announced in March 2020, people stampeded shops to buy many months\u2019 worth of food and supplies to the extent that many economies experienced shortages with food products, medical materials, toilet paper, and even home workout equipment. The lockdown was the closest thing to an apocalypse most people had experienced up to that point, and they wanted to be prepared.\n\nIn Namibia, the pandemic also affected retail shops. The government had locked down the country without making adequate palliative plans to support its people during the period. Taxis didn\u2019t run and shop owners couldn\u2019t transport themselves to and fro their suppliers for goods.\n\nIn the midst of the crisis, it soon became apparent that Namibia had a broken supply chain.\n\nOne man, David Akinin, who once worked in the construction industry as a founder, decided to intervene. He loaded his truck with food and essential supplies and drove around, selling them to people\u2014a sort of mobile retail shop. They were grateful for his intervention. But it wasn\u2019t enough; informal shops needed to reopen.\n\nAkinin\u2019s idea to provide food and essentials to people during lockdown gave birth to a company\u2014Jabu. \u201cWhen you\u2019re building something and people start thanking you for it, you know you\u2019ve found something great,\u201d Akinin told TechCabal on a call.\n\nJabu partnered with local and multinational suppliers to deliver their goods directly to informal retailers across Namibia. In the process, they faced a challenge: it was difficult to locate retailers who didn\u2019t have registered or verified addresses. The startup then worked with local community leaders to register retailers in their area and log the GPS location of each shop in the Jabu app. Within 2 weeks they identified the location of 1,000 shops.\n\nHeadquartered in Namibia, with operations in Zambia, Jabu is a data-driven e-commerce startup that helps small retailers with sourcing products and inventory management. Its platform connects over 6,000 retailers to local and international suppliers; and digitises their orders, payments, and logistics. The startup currently operates out of 5 cities and 9 sites.\n\nMid-2021, Jabu raised $3.2 million in seed funding, led by Afore Capital, with participation from Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital, and unnamed angel investors.\n\nThe funding makes Jabu the first Namibian startup to be backed by YC.\n\nSceptical investors\n\nAkinin, who is founder and CEO of Jabu, is originally from Venezuela but has lived in Namibia for 9 years. When he got on the call with TechCabal, he was outdoors, seated in a veranda overlooking vibrant greenery. He was in Zambia, he said, where Jabu had opened an office in November last year. He would later reveal that it had been raining a lot in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, affecting Jabu\u2019s fleet operations.\n\nThe supply chain problem Jabu has set out to solve is a thorny one, and the solution it is building is critical to economic development. Yet, for a long time, the startup struggled to attract investment. \u201cOur first challenge was getting investors to recognise the country,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of people, on their first call, looked up Namibia on the map!\u201d\n\nInvestors Akinin approached were concerned about Jabu\u2019s potential to scale in Namibia, a country whose economy went into recession in 2016 and has been struggling to recover ever since.\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, the African Development Bank Group (ADBG) projected that the Namibian economy would shrink by 7.9% in 2020, due to an expected decline in activity in mining, agriculture, construction, hospitality, and tourism. Post-lockdown, the decline actually happened. Namibia\u2019s GDP dropped by 8.5% in 2020, and the population of its poor has now hit a record high of 1.6 million persons.\n\nNow, although the economy is expected to make a rebound, albeit a slow one\u2014with growth projected at 1.2% in 2021 and 2.4% in 2022\u2014one can see that the country has had a rough few years, which may have caused it to miss out on the Great Venture Capitalist Influx Africa has recorded in the last 3\u20134 years.\n\nMoreover, it is well known that venture capitalists (VC) channel most of their African investment towards startups in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Kenya. These countries\u2014dubbed the Big Four\u2014are Africa\u2019s busiest tech markets; compared to them, Namibia has a tiny population\u20142.5 million persons, where Nigeria has 206 million, Egypt 102 million, South Africa 59 million, and Kenya 53 million.\n\nAnd so, it is against this backdrop that investors were concerned about Jabu\u2019s scalability. Their recurring question was whether Namibia could produce a startup that could be worth $100 million in returns, and Akinin\u2019s answer\u2014precise each time\u2014was yes.\n\n\u201cA huge responsibility\u201d\n\nReflecting on Jabu being the first Namibian startup to be backed by YC, Akinin said, \u201cIt feels like such a huge responsibility, for us, towards an ecosystem that has been trying, for a long time, to raise awareness about the great things happening in Namibia. But it\u2019s a good opportunity to bring people into the Namibian ecosystem and onto our platform. It\u2019s inspiration for other companies still pushing hard and hoping to get more money this year.\u201d\n\nAkinin believes that the Namibian startup scene will get more funding attention now because there is an \u201can openness to innovation\u201d from both local founders and investors. \u201cInvestors around the world are opening their eyes to the understanding that there is opportunity in Namibia. I served as an ambassador of what\u2019s happening on the ground and was fortunate to have been able to share that story with investors.\u201d\n\nA tale of 2 countries\n\nFor a young startup, Akinin and his team remain undaunted by the challenges associated with operating in 2 different markets. For starters, they are dealing with unstable infrastructure in both Zambia and Namibia. And while there are frequent power outages in Lusaka, unlike in Windhoek, in both countries, more than half of Jabu\u2019s customers are in places without tarred roads, making logistics difficult: \u201cYou can see why the supply chain does not exist, in the first place,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cBecause there are no roads to the places we need to reach. We\u2019ve had to map roads that didn\u2019t exist previously in order to create a route to market.\u201d\n\nIn Lusaka, incessant rains have made movement on potholed roads near-impossible\u2014\u201cIt has got to the point where I\u2019m willing to invest in paving the road in front of our warehouse, just so that our vehicles can move smoothly.\u201d\n\nHe described Lusaka as a \u201cbillboard city\u201d but is unsure yet how to leverage that fact for Jabu\u2019s growth in the country. \u201cThere\u2019s advertising everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cMarketing and branding are a really different experience to what we have in Windhoek. We\u2019re very excited about getting to know it and taking some learnings from it back to Namibia.\u201d\n\nOn to the next round\n\nAfrican e-commerce startups have recorded an impressive spike in VC funding since 2019, raising nearly $90 million dollars in 2020, up from $47.5 million in 2019. Between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, the total value of raises by e-commerce startups hit $140 million. The spike in funding may have been triggered by the lockdown, as the pandemic emphasised the gaps in the supply chain of many industries, forcing e-commerce entrepreneurs to innovate around the problem.\n\nFollowing its raise last year, Jabu is looking to expand to other countries in Southern Africa\u2014Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The path to this expansion is still being developed and fine-tuned by the team. For now, however, Akinin\u2019s focus is on raising for Series A and consolidating his company\u2019s operations in Zambia.\n\nShare this article",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from education, there is probably no other industry that contributes as much to the development of a society like healthcare. Unhealthy individuals can\u2019t build businesses, fight for good governance, or create life-changing innovations. So it\u2019s no surprise that some of the poorest countries in the world have the worst quality of healthcare.\n\nBefore it was stopped in 2000, the highest-ranked African country in the World Health Organization\u2019s health system rankings was Morocco in 29th position. Tunisia, the next in the continent, was in 52nd place. Not much has changed in the 21 years since. A report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) described healthcare in Africa as the worst globally, with 50% of healthcare expenditure out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMuch like the education sector, developments in Africa\u2019s healthcare space are driven by the private sector as underfunded public health facilities struggle to meet demand. In South Africa, one healthtech startup is helping South Africans access drugs and health advice using their phones. I sat down with one of the startup\u2019s co-founders \u2013 Healthdart \u2013 to learn more about its operations.\n\nMission-driven entrepreneurship\n\nIn the early 2000s, South Africa had an HIV crisis on its hands. About to get into the university, Njabulo Skhosana decided to study pharmacology at the University of Liverpool. The plan was to learn how he could help stem the tide, but he took a different route with stints at Bupa, Deloitte, and Discovery Health. The one constant thing in all these jobs was healthcare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2020, just a few weeks after the government imposed lockdowns in South Africa, he quit his job as the Chief of Staff to the CEO at Discovery Health to build Healthdart \u2013 a one-stop-shop for primary health care services.\n\nBringing primary health care closer to the people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart co-founders, L-R, Yauvan Hansraj (CTO), Njabulo Skhosana (CEO), and Tshwanelo Matsane (CPO). Source: Healthdart\n\nMost plans to improve healthcare in Africa are focused on secondary care, with primary healthcare often an afterthought. As a result, most Africans ignore symptoms of ill health until they get really serious. The disadvantage of this approach is that conditions that could have been prevented or treated early may now be too advanced for the patient to get help.\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution uses an app to provide a platform where users can place orders for their drugs and have them delivered at less than the cost of the cheapest two-way bus ride (R30 or $1.99) in South African townships. Customers can choose to pay using electronic funds transfer before they receive the drugs or at the point of exchange using a card or cash.\n\nOne might ask what is so special about providing an avenue for patients to order and have their drugs delivered to them where they choose. Let me paint a picture. Imagine that you had a cold and got a prescription from a doctor; however, you have to journey to the nearest pharmacy to get the medication because there are no pharmacies close to you.\n\nAssuming you had a job and this happened during the week, you would have to take some time off from work to get your prescription. If you\u2019re fortunate, you could get your boss to give you the time you need. Yet, even with permission, people living in South Africa\u2019s townships have to take long and often stressful journeys without an assurance that they will get the drugs they need.\n\nAnd this is where Healthdart steps in. The startup does not just deliver drugs to patients; it also facilitates virtual and physical consultations with doctors and nurses. Consequently, the startup can provide comprehensive access to primary health care services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart delivers its solution via an app and yet targets middle-income neighbourhoods. With less disposable income, this society is less likely to have a smartphone, and I was curious to know how Healthdart intends to reach them.\n\n\u201cI think if you asked me that question five years ago, we would not have been able to start the business. Right now, we find that people can get basic android phones at low prices within the South African market,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis reply corresponds to a 2020 report from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) that claims that the smartphone penetration in South Africa stands at ~91%. Even with that, the startup ensures that at 17 megabytes, the app is light enough to run on low-end smartphones while it uses WhatsApp to complement its customer service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthdart\u2019s solution is not novel, and there are startups across Africa that either offer a platform for patients to order drugs or speak with a physician. Still, Skhosana argues that Healthdart provides more than convenience to its customers.\n\n\u201cA huge part of our value proposition is reducing the total cost of care, and that is very different from what our competitors do. In most cases, the focus is on convenience, almost like trying to create an UberEats for medicine. But we see our role as a lot more integral to the person\u2019s lifestyle and just trying to make it as easy and affordable as possible for them to access the right level of healthcare that they need.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\nSince its launch, Healthdart has primarily focused on a few South African townships. However, it plans to add more townships and cities to the areas it currently covers before exploring possible expansion options. In this time, the startup has facilitated more than 1,000 medication orders and health consultations across Johannesburg.\n\nInitially incubated in the Founders Factory Africa, it has also raised money from BFA Global\u2019s Catalyst Fund as it moves towards building a one-stop-shop for primary healthcare service in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Or at least that\u2019s what Olufunmi thinks every time she ventures out from her house in the hinterlands of Ikorodu.\n\nFor example, Funmi entered a bus going to Ikeja last Saturday.\n\n\u201cEnter with your change o,\u201d called the conductor in a loud, whiny voice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have change o. It\u2019s \u20a6500 I have,\u201d Funmi told him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOya enter like that.\u201d\n\nWhen it was time to get her change, the conductor paired her with another passenger. To worsen matters, she never got to her destination because the driver\u2019s brakes failed and the bus rammed into another car.\n\nReally, Lagos is not a real place.\n\nFunmi\u2019s semi-fictional story is reminiscent of the average Lagosian\u2019s experience on Lagos roads. From the bad roads to the rickety buses to the uncouth drivers and conductors to the abysmal customer service.\n\nWhile the introduction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses has been a much-needed respite, a 2021 Danne Institute for Research Report reveals that Lagosians lose 14.2 million hours per day to traffic congestion caused, in part, by bad roads. It also cost the Lagos government \u20a64 trillion ($96 million).\n\nApart from these challenges, security issues leading to tales of one chance, armed robbery, and petty theft abound.\n\nWhile infrastructure challenges like bad roads and some aspects of security are pretty out of the reach of the average Nigerian entrepreneur to solve, we\u2019ve seen several startups, including Shuttlers, GIG Mobility, and Treepz, try to tackle different parts of the problem.\n\nNewcomer, Transtura, is making its play into Nigeria\u2019s mobility and logistics space. One of five nominees in the Newbie of the Year category of Techpoint Awards 2021, the startup founded by Vincent Adeoba and two other friends, was launched last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked to Adeoba and discussed Transtura\u2019s journey, its recent acquisition of fintech startup, W\u00e0z\u00f3 money, and the future.\n\nTurning lemons into lemonade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrasnstura Co-founders. L-R: Vincent Adeyemo, Vincent Adeoba, and Olajide Philips\n\nIn 2017, Vincent Adeoba started a job as a Graduate Intern with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). He had just finished his one-year mandatory youth service and had also just bought a car.\n\nEarning just above \u20a6100,000 ($299)* monthly, he took his mentor\u2019s advice and rented the car to someone who used it as an Uber at a weekly rental of \u20a630,000 ($90). It would start him on his journey in the transport and logistics sector and the eventual founding of Transtura.\n\nIn 2019, Adeoba got capital from friends and family and acquired 13 vehicles to expand the car rental business. However, 2020 came in with the COVID-19 pandemic and brought things to a standstill for him. But, he soon found a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cI discovered that despite the restriction in movement, some of these shuttle mini-buses were still allowed to work. So I started divesting my investments in buying those vehicles for Uber, and I started researching about these shuttle mini-buses.\n\n\u201cWith my research and data available to me, I even discovered that in terms of return on investment and the capital outlay required for the buses, they are even better than Uber. Sometimes, for Uber, you won\u2019t get your capital outlay back until almost two years, even before making a profit. With these buses, capital outlay could be gotten in a year and six months.\u201d\n\nPutting in \u20a61.3 million ($3,421)**, he got the first bus and, within nine months, had acquired 14 more buses using his tried and trusted family and friends route.\n\nBut he soon began to think about other issues like safety and convenience for the user. On October 18, 2021, the Transtura app was officially launched.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing the business in a traditional way, but I was just thinking, \u2018how can we bring in technology to improve commuters\u2019 experience, to provide safety, to provide comfort, and at the same time, to redefine the way people see intra-city commuting in Lagos?\u2019\u201d\n\nCurrently, the app is available on the Google Play Store and will soon be available on the App Store. For now, iOS users can use its web app.\n\nTranstura has three routes: Iyana Oworo to Victoria Island, Yaba to Victoria Island, and Abraham Adesanya to CMS.\n\nBringing in Co-founders Vincent Adeyemo \u2014 a lawyer friend he had met in school \u2014 and Olajide Philips, the trio\u2019s Transtura journey began.\n\nWhat are the metrics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Adeoba, Transtura has received little funding from the outside world. However, the company is also backed by Tekedia Capital and is looking to raise its pre-seed round.\n\nWith only three routes, he says the company can barely meet demand and has 2,500 active users. The business model, while not new, is different from what typically obtains.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we pay drivers a salary to drive the buses for us.\u201d\n\nThey had initially planned to use a rent-to-own model, but they chose their current model to protect the brand and prevent issues associated with hire purchase or rent-to-own agreements.\n\n\u201cWhen you give people an asset to use on a rent-to-own basis or on hire purchase in this part of the world, they start seeing themselves as the owners of that asset from the first day you give it to them. And you have little to no control again.\u201d\n\nThere are plans to change the model to a more Uber-like model, probably partly because of the current challenge with the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW). According to Adeoba, every day, they have to pay \u20a61,000 to \u20a61,500 to NURTW agents on the road for each bus; sometimes, they pay per trip.\n\nIt\u2019s quite tough running a business in this manner, but he says they\u2019ve been able to deal with it using some level of tact and street smarts.\n\n\u201cWe told them what we are trying to do, and we were able to paint a very good picture to show that we are not competing with them.\u201d\n\nDriving new ways to shop and travel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Transtura and W\u00e0z\u00f3 team\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria first introduced its cashless policy in 2012, 65 out of 100 Nigerians transacted in cash.\n\nFast forward a couple of years, and while alternative payment channels have gained some momentum, cash is still king.\n\nEssentially, many everyday transactions like paying for a bus or buying tomatoes in the market are still cash-based. However, in Lagos State, Touch and Pay\u2019s Cowry card is changing the mobility game with its contactless cards.\n\nWith its acquisition of W\u00e0z\u00f3 for an undisclosed fee, Transtura\u2019s digital payment plans require some attention.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Stephen Ilori and Abudu Ridwan Olatunbosun, W\u00e0z\u00f3 is a payments service company that deals with bill payments. From what Adeoba told Techpoint Africa, this acquisition marks Transtura\u2019s entry into the digital payments and eCommerce space.\n\n\u201cAfter three months of our operations on the road, we discovered that beyond providing vehicles to people and providing the extra comfort and safety, the biggest opportunity in the transportation ecosystem is actually in payments.\n\n\u201cWe want to get into digital payments where people can have a universal wallet. So either you\u2019re riding with Transtura, or you\u2019re riding with the normal danfo, or you are even travelling outside the state, you will be able to use your Transtura wallet to make payments to the vendors and the drivers.\u201d\n\nAlongside the wallet, Adeoba says the company is looking to launch a marketplace for drivers to buy spare parts and other vehicle-related goods. They would be able to pay for this using their Transtura wallet.\n\nFor the passenger, payment would be made by scanning a QR code placed at strategic points in the vehicle. However, this has a familiar ring to it.\n\nIn 2019, we wrote about a new startup, named Gona, trying to make transport transactions cashless using QR codes.\n\nAdeoba says Transtura is quite different for several reasons, one of which is the company\u2019s plan to make its product an enterprise solution (B2B) rather than B2C for now. He also believes that the ancillary services, which come with the wallet, like the marketplace and an expense management card, give it a leg to stand on in terms of a revenue model.\n\nAs part of its B2B solution, an expense card would be given to each driver for expenses like fuel and minor but necessary vehicle maintenance while on the road. The card can be set to a particular spending limit each day and helps business owners keep track of money spent.\n\nMuch of this solution is targeted at large-scale mobility and logistics companies.\n\nThere are also plans to launch its Flexi Hire feature, which would enable persons to charter buses for different uses.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello, people\n\nHow was St Valentine\u2019s Day? Did you spend it with your loved one(s)? Or were you a dogged soldier and kept on coding, writing, designing, and building stuff? Mine had a mixture of everything plus more. While the Nigerian government\u2019s ICT ministry entered a new relationship, I probably fractured one with my big mouth.\n\nYes, you heard that right; Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Communications and the Digital Economy has entered a partnership with the European Union (EU) to aid Nigeria\u2019s digital transformation. The EU plans to invest \u20ac820 million ($927 million) under its global gateway initiative.\n\nThey reportedly plan to invest in digital infrastructure, digitalisation of public services, digital entrepreneurship, digital skills, and digital governance. Yes, the Nigerian government needs all the help it can get. I mean, it only just recovered from the breakdown of its digital identity management platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides the ID management platform, several Nigerian public websites were affected by a \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d, so we hope the additional millions will help shore some of these glitches. The partnership terms are not clear, but let\u2019s hope it yields fruits, and none of the parties has a big mouth like mine.\n\nMoving on, Let\u2019s talk about:\n\nAirtel\u2019s strategic appointment\n\nStitch\u2019s plan to connect Africa\n\nRemedial\u2019s plan to digitise Nigerian pharmacies.\n\nAirtel makes a strategic hire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlubayo Adekanmbi. Vice President, Airtel Africa. Source: TechEconomy\n\nSometimes, big business moves start with statements of intent. Actions that tell the world that you\u2019re not playing games. Three days ago, Airtel Africa made one of such big statements, as it poached one of MTN\u2019s executives, Bayo Adekanmbi, to become its Vice President.\n\nAccording to Airtel, Adekanmbi will be \u201cresponsible for leading strategic business-wide initiatives, including innovation, strategic investment, operational efficiencies, and partnerships. In addition to this, he is also responsible for delivering Airtel Africa\u2019s Group Sustainability.\u201d\n\nSome context: Adekanmbi served with MTN Nigeria and South Africa for 14 years, and it worked in various critical roles across strategy, marketing, and management. Before joining Airtel, he was MTN Nigeria\u2019s Chief Strategy Officer. He is also the founder of Data Science Nigeria (DSN), a non-profit focused on scaling AI research and knowledge in Nigeria.\n\nWhy this is interesting: So far, MTN has dominated Nigeria\u2019s telecom space. It is Nigeria\u2019s largest telecom services provider in terms of voice and data subscribers and network coverage.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2021, MTN\u2019s revenue ($1.07 billion), more than doubled Airtel\u2019s ($476 million). Consequently, like other Nigerian telcos, Airtel has significant ground to make up if it plans to get close to MTN.\n\nIn previous years, we\u2019ve enjoyed data wars, an analysis of Internet subscriber growth using data from Nigeria\u2019s telecom regulators, but MTN and Airtel\u2019s financial reports offer deeper insights that we can\u2019t wait to explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Airtel\u2019s Adekanmbi\u2019s appointment screams game on, but what other moves might we expect in 2022?\n\nStitch raises $21 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStitch Team. Source: Supplied\n\nNo one needs to mention that Africa\u2019s fintech space grows in leaps and bounds. You would be hard-pressed to find a week when an African fintech didn\u2019t raise money. Prove me wrong; I dare you.\n\nYou could, however, miss the different dimensions fintechs are taking, in response to market needs.\n\nToday, API-fintech startups are building the infrastructure for financial data, which is becoming increasingly important.\n\nTo start the week, South African API-fintech startup, Stitch, has raised $21 million Series A to build its API infrastructure and a financial graph ecosystem for Africa.\n\nWhat does Stitch do? Like most fintech infrastructure companies, it helps businesses build, optimise and scale their products using APIs connected to players in a country\u2019s financial sector.\n\nFor example, it could help facilitate communication between your Wallet app or savings app and your commercial bank.\n\nWhile the likes of Plaid, Tink, and Belvo lead the way in the US, Europe, and Latin America, respectively, Africa\u2019s fintech API space is replete with players like Mono, Okra, OnePipe, and US-based Pngme.\n\nInteresting point: Stitch defines its planned financial graph as a platform that will let businesses write code once, launch, and scale in multiple markets. Yes, it will facilitate communication between fintechs and banks across numerous African countries.\n\nThe big picture: Achieving interoperability in a heavily regulated industry is difficult enough in one country, but to do it in multiple African countries? That\u2019s on a whole new level.\n\nTravel, remittance, and trade are still fraught with severe challenges within Africa. Hundreds of African Union meetings and a fully ratified free trade agreement has not changed much. Don\u2019t forget sub-regional trade deals from the EU and the US.\n\nThere\u2019s hope: Systemic problems can, sometimes, create entrepreneurial openings, as we saw with Norebase, so let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed for Stitch\u2019s success.\n\nStitch raises $21M for its API infrastructure and embedded finance platform.

Source: Supplied\n\nIn 2010, NAFDAC introduced the Mobile Authentication Service (MAS) scheme to get customers involved in countering counterfeit and substandard medical products. By sending a one-time PIN, hidden behind a silver panel on a product packet, to a short code, a customer can know if a product is genuine or fake.\n\nThis measure was expedient because pharmacies and patent medicine stores stock substandard products on purpose or by accident. In the latter case, the business would start looking for credible suppliers and pharmaceutical companies to minimise such situations.\n\nAs usual, tech startups are here to the rescue.\n\nRecently admitted into the Winter 2022 cohort of US-accelerator, YCombinator, and closed a $1 million pre-seed round is Remedial Health, a Nigerian healthtech startup that develops digital solutions to reduce the supply of substandard health products to pharmacies and medicine stores.\n\nLed by Global Venture \u2014 that invested in TeamApt and Helium Health \u2014 and Ventures Platform, also invested in this round are Ingressive Capital, Voltron Capital, an Angel syndicate fund by Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d AGboola, Victor Asemota, and Opeyemi Awoyemi. Interestingly, this is over 80% participation from African VCs and angel investors.\n\nThe two-year-old startup intends to direct this fund into rolling out its digital procurement and patient medication records (PMR platforms and also support its By-Now-Pay-Letter\n\nRead more: YC-backed Remedial Health raises $1 million pre-seed to digitize pharmacies in Nigeria\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat Valentine\u2019s Day could look like in the Metaverse and Web3 era.

It is big, capable of adding to more to power supply than has been added since the last eight years, \u201d a source close to deal told BusinessDay.\n\nExperts said this development is seen as a great achievement for Nigeria\u2019s power sector as the $500 million Geometric/Aba power plant has the capacity to produce and distribute about 141 megawatts (MW) of electricity in its first phase, with new distribution lines, four new sub-stations and three rehabilitated sub-stations.\n\nEach plant is to produce 47 MW of power, supported by a 60 MVA per transformer. The power plant is to be powered by gas and so the company has built a gas plant at Shell company flow station at Owaza in Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State and laid a pipeline spanning 27 kilometres to the power plant at Osisioma.\n\nRead also: TCN takes delivery of 15 new power transformers\n\nIt will be recalled that on May 11, 2004, the Federal Government, the now-defunct National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) and Geometric Power Limited (GPL) entered into and executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which GPL was granted the exclusive right to construct a 3 x 35 MW open cycle gas turbine power plant and designated sub-stations in Aba, Abia State, which would generate electric power for distribution by Aba Power Limited (APL) to residential and commercial customers and to industrial clusters in a ring-fenced island in Aba.\n\nThe government, NEPA and APL executed a lease agreement on April 28, 2005, for the distribution of power to the ring-fenced residential and commercial consumers in Aba. By the terms of the agreement, NEPA assigned its right to distribute electric power in the ring-fenced area of Owerri-nta, Osisisoma, Ogbor Hill, Factory road and Port Harcourt road in Aba and also leased its distribution facilities within the contract area to Aba Power Limited.\n\nA supplementary agreement was made on August 31, 2006, between the Federal Government, represented by the minister of power and steel, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and Enugu Distribution Company (EDC) and Geometric/Aba Power Limited.

          "title": "First time for Nigeria, $100 oil price means nothing",
          "text": "A hundred dollar oil price is good news for any oil-producing nation, but for the first time in Nigeria\u2019s history, it won\u2019t be enough to save the country\u2019s ailing economy that faces a record seventh straight year of falling real income or per capita GDP.\n\nOn Monday, prices of Brent crude hit their highest level of $94 in more than seven years, as some in the market think it is now a question of when \u2014 not if \u2014 oil hits triple digits above $100, somewhere it has not been since 2014.\n\nWhile a $100 oil price means a boom for oil-dependent countries like Saudi Arabia, for the first time in Nigeria\u2019s history it means nothing as an opaque subsidy scheme and struggling oil fields meant the flight of badly needed investment resulting from the failure to produce more oil to take advantage of soaring crude prices.\n\nBased on Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 (OPEC) data, the only time in history when average crude oil price reached $100 was in 2011 ($107), 2012 ($109.45) and 2013 ($105.87).\n\nThis period translated to improved economic activities as Nigeria recorded an average oil production of 2011 (2.5 million bpd), 2012(1.9 million bpd) and 2013 (2.2 million bpd).\n\n\u201cWith the current system in place, Nigeria needs more than a miracle to have an oil boom at N150,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, a former chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), says.\n\nOPEC data also show the highest price ever paid for crude oil was between June and July 2008, when a barrel of crude oil was sold around $130 to $147, although the average crude oil price in 2008 ended up being $94.45 per barrel.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil assets are facing rising existential risks which are compounded by wasteful expenditure,\u201d Nwakwue says.\n\nThe highest price ever paid for crude oil was between June and July 2008, when a barrel of crude oil was sold around $130 to $147, although the average crude oil price in 2008 ended up being $94.45 per barrel.\n\n\u201cDespite rising oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s oil production is currently struggling at levels never seen before, but the regulators are ignoring the problem and disguising under OPEC\u2019s quota,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, notes.\n\nBusinessDay analysis shows an oil price increase from $14 per barrel in 1979 to $35 per barrel in 1981 could mean an oil boom for Nigeria\u2019s 1981 population of 75.4 million people, because an oil export revenue of $24.9 billion led to an oil revenue per capita of $330. However, $35 means little or nothing for Nigeria\u2019s current population of over 200 million people.\n\nAlso, a higher oil price from $10 per barrel to $147 per barrel in 2008 may be enough for a population of 150.3 million because of $54.9 million oil revenue, which leads to an oil revenue per capita of $0.365, but certainly not in 2021.\n\nIn the face of dwindling incomes, the government has held on against the call for full deregulation.\n\n\u201cNigeria is like a man who is dying from dehydration despite being in the midst of a ferocious rainfall,\u201d notes economist Festus Ogbobine.\n\nThe struggle against subsidy has a strong historical socio-political context, in which organised labour is central. Occupy Nigeria, which has become a reference in civil unrest, shut down the country for almost two weeks in 2012 following the government\u2019s first bold step at ending petrol subsidy, which the Goodluck Jonathan administration said claimed $18 billion in 2011.\n\nRecent attempts at ending the age-long social scheme with the petrol consumption figures from the authorities ranging from between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres, have been similarly stalled by endless negotiations between the government and labour unions.\n\nRead also: Dirty petrol saga: Middlemen explore fresh tricks in Nigeria\u2019s opaque oil contracts\n\nSpeaking on the dynamics of rising consumption figures and increasing subsidy payment, Timipre Sylva, the minister of petroleum resources, explained that although there was something fishy about the data, there\u2019s nothing that hadn\u2019t been done in the past to muscle those bleeding the country without success.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. For me what is the sum total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nIf the government bites the bullet and deregulates the downstream sector, the challenges in oil and gas may not end. It will, however, free some resources for other timely infrastructure interventions, experts have noted.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay show Nigeria spent N270.83 billion to cater for the cost of petroleum shortfall in December 2021. This was the highest cost for the petrol shortfall in the year.\n\nIn November and October, petrol subsidy payments stood at N131.4 billion and N163 billion, respectively, according to the findings.\n\nIn September, it was 149.28 billion. In August, the under-recovery cost of petrol was N173.13 billion. For July and June, it was N103.28 billion and N164.33 billion, respectively. In May, the cost of subsidy amounted to N126.29 billion.\n\nAlso, in April, March, and February, the under-recovery amounted to N61.96 billion, N60.39 billion, and N25.37 billion, respectively. In January, there was no record for under-recovery.\n\nExperts say perhaps, there is no better time to end the scourge than now. The national debt stocks had hit N32.9 trillion in December. While the government regrets mounting debts and declining financial capacity, the cost of governance, which subsidy is just a part of, has continued to rise.",

          "text": "Flight delays have continued to worsen as 16 airports across Nigeria do not have facilities for night operations, forcing airlines to cancel flights that cannot meet up with the 6.30 pm landing time.\n\nOut of 22 airports managed by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) only Abuja, Port Harcourt, Benin City, Enugu, Kano, and Kaduna airports have airfield lightning to enable flights land and take off on or after 6.30pm, while others are referred to as \u2018Day Light\u2019 airports.\n\nThey say when aircraft develop technical issues or there is a weather issue making airlines operate behind schedule, the flight time to these airports may be delayed, which means outright cancellations since airlines cannot operate into them at a certain time.\n\nThe situation has worsened because many air travellers have taken to the air as Nigerian roads have become unsafe.\n\nNigeria\u2019s biggest domestic airport, the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, also does not have airfield lighting for night flights, thereby forcing airlines to land at the International terminal, then taxi for 20 to 30 minutes to the domestic terminal to disembark passengers.\n\nObiora Okonkwo, chairman, United Nigeria Airlines, laments that one of the major challenges of the daylight airport is that it forces airlines to limit their operations to those airports to 6:30 pm.\n\nOkonkwo says no airline enjoys delaying or cancelling flights but the inability to land and take-off from these airports on or after 6.30 pm is causing airlines huge revenues as they have to cancel flights more frequently.\n\n\u201c80 percent of Nigerian airports are daylight airports. This sunset regime puts a lot of pressure on our operations and our schedule because you have to schedule to make sure you start your business and end before sunset. You might not believe that all the local airports here are on sunset operations, it has to be looked into.\n\n\u201cThere must be a proper extension, these airports are there and if you don\u2019t have the facilities to operate up to a certain time like 11 pm-12 pm and it costs the operators huge sums of money. If airlines operate till 11 pm or 12 pm, they will be at liberty to spread flight intervals and that will increase on-time performance and customer confidence,\u201d he states.\n\nAnother operator, who craved anonymity, states that airlines have continued to write to the authorities to ensure these airports are upgraded for night flights but the request has been ignored.\n\nThe operator says if this continues, many airlines may go under as just daily flights may no longer be sustainable as more airlines enter the market.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary-general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), tells BusinessDay that FAAN and other regulatory authorities should be blamed for failures to provide airfield lighting that is a major safety feature at the airport.\n\nRead also: \u2018Pilots, engineers should not limit themselves to flying, repairing aircraft to be employed\u2019\n\nFAAN and the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) should answer the questions why there have been no airfield lighting in most of the airports and why the repairs of the MMA 18L have not been done more than 10 years after, Ojikutu states\n\nHe says the excuses for others can be related to passenger traffic and the published hours of their operations.\n\n\u201cYou cannot compare the passengers\u2019 traffic figures at Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and possibly Kano where there are AFL and 24 hours operational hours with airports like Jos, Yola, Maiduguri, Sokoto, Katsina, Ibadan, and Akure, with operational hours limit at 18.00 hours; whereas passengers traffic figures for airports like Enugu, Owerri, Benin City, and Calabar require that the operational hours of these airports be reviewed upwards to 20.00 or 22.00 hours daily from 17.00 or 18.00 hours.\u201d\n\nHe notes that these latter airports would require AFL so that airlines can fly to them after sunset.\n\n\u201cOne major solution to these is to allocate some of these airports as operational bases for the domestic airlines instead of their concentration in Lagos MMA. Their first flight should be from their operational bases to the prominent ones like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, and from these they can begin their market sharing,\u201d he advises.",
          "summary": "Flight delays have continued to worsen as 16 airports across Nigeria do not have facilities for night operations, forcing airlines to cancel flights that cannot meet up with the 6.30 pm landing time.\nObiora Okonkwo, chairman, United Nigeria Airlines, laments that one of the major challenges of the daylight airport is that it forces airlines to limit their operations to those airports to 6:30 pm.\n\u201c80 percent of Nigerian airports are daylight airports.\nYou might not believe that all the local airports here are on sunset operations, it has to be looked into.\n\u201cOne major solution to these is to allocate some of these airports as operational bases for the domestic airlines instead of their concentration in Lagos MMA.",

They are not interested; they are interested in their own profits. That led us to this arrangement of the Ossiomo power plant, which is working and we are enjoying it here in Government House.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we cannot connect you to that 24-hour power supply. We are fortunately in the next round of electrification of EBS.\n\n\u201cYou know we\u2019ve done the first 80km, we are going to be doing another 60km. We will be extending the line towards Ikpoba Hill to Auchi Road and will be able to connect you. We had purchased some terrestrial equipment that was destroyed as a result of a storm thunder strike last year.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cI agree with you that we must begin to say more now especially as we head towards 2023 general elections. We are going to be reinstituting the quarterly media briefing. Next to my office, I am building an ultra-modern studio. I am equipping it with very high-end digital cameras so that we will have a venue. It\u2019s going to commence from next quarter.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have every agency of government to have a plan, have its own key performance indicators, and their score cards. They must be able to tell us what they are expected to deliver every year on a quarterly basis and everybody must be free to interrogate the performance of every agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means you have to also do an evaluation of every person working in government. In terms of the health insurance scheme, I really want to indulge you to key into it, I really don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t provide you free medical services, please explore that,\u201d he charged.\n\nEarlier in his address, Alenkhe reassured the governor of the collaboration of journalists in the state in ensuring the realization of the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAs the train of strategic engagement tour of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State moved to Ede Federal Constituency, the Ogiyan of Enigbo, Oba Omowonuola Oyeyode Oyesosin and other traditional rulers in the area have said that the governor\u2019s second term bid is non-negotiable just as not less than 150 loyalists of the opposition party \u2014 the Peoples Democratic Party defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress during the tour\n\nThe defectors who attributed their decision to the modest achievements the Oyetola-led Administration has recorded in the last three years, said they resolved to join the ruling party so as to be part of the success story.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the defectors, Mr. Bamidele Sunday, said they were motivated to join the progressive party, having seen and attested to the good work and tremendous achievements of Governor Oyetola.\n\nThe monarchs said they have already passed a resolution to work for his second term as there was no need changing a winning team.\n\nThey said the Governor has performed creditably well to earn a second term and continued royal support, having outweighed his predecessors in taking the welfare and general well-being of the masses, particularly the traditional rulers as priority.\n\nSpeaking in his palace, Ogiyan of Ejigbo, Oba Oyesosin, lauded the Governor for his remarkable achievements in the last three years.\n\nOgiyan who described Oyetola as a welfarist and an administror par excellence, said, \u201cI have never seen a Governor like you since I have been on earth.\u201d\n\nOba Oyesosin thanked the Governor for reconstructing Osogbo-Ejigbo road and for revitalising Ejigbo General Hospital which he said had been abandoned for years before his intervention.\n\nThe reverred monarch stated further, \u201cSince I have been on earth, I have never seen a Governor like Oyetola. I have spent 48 years on the throne and since my enthronement, I have never seen a man or Governor like you. You have done so well for me, my town, the Council and for the State. I am also Gboyega because your name has reflected in all you do, you have been doing great since assumption of office.\n\n\u201cWe should do everything to support him. He has done many things that deserve prayers. Your good works will speak for you. It is God that makes kings or leaders. We are grateful to God for giving us a man like you to serve at this moment. Your second term ambition is a walk over as long as Ejigbo, and by extension, Osun, is concerned.\n\n\u201cWe want Ejigbo to Iwo road to be rehabilitated. We want the Faculty of Agriculture, the satellite campus of UNIOSUN in Ejigbo to become a full-fleged University of Agriculture. We thank you for equipping the General Hospital that you gave us. We appreciate the fire service station and we want them to be well equipped.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for the Osogbo-Ejigbo road that you have reconstructed for us. What we used to hear before your emergence was there was no money. We don\u2019t know where you are getting money from. I am with you, I have aligned with you, I have queued behind you and I will continue to do everything to support you.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Alawo of Awo, Oba Abdul-Rasaq Ajibade Adegboye Abioye, lauded the Governor for being resolute and committed to the people\u2019s welfare since assumption of office.\n\nOba Abioye who enumerated some of the achievements of the Governor in the State in general and Egbedore Local Government Area in particular, disclosed that all the traditional rulers have resolved to work for him for second term.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou are a prophet. It is God that chose you for us. You are God-sent at this moment in view of what you have been doing for us. You have done well. There are lots of things to point at in the State in terms of real development across sectors. Our council is not left behind in your Developmental Agenda and we are grateful for this.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to support you because you have convinced us with your commitment to transform our State and give Osun particularly the state capital, Osogbo, a facelift of genuine development.\n\n\u201cOur resolution is that you will be returned and nothing can change this. To us, once a team is doing well, there is no reason to change the winning team. Indeed, you have a listening ear, you have demonstrated this several times. You listen to everyone irrespective of status. We are proud of you. You are going to spend your eight years by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nIn their separate remarks, Alayemore of Ido-Osun, Oba Aderemi Adedapo and the Aragberi of Iragberi, Oba Folorunsho Agboade Makanju, appreciated the Governor for the good works his Administration has been doing.\n\n\u201cYour immense contributions to the growth and development of traditional institution are unprecedented. You have done well and there is no negotiation in your re-election. You have been part of the modest achievements we have recorded. Your achievements are there as testimonial for all to see and believe strongly that your good works will earn you your return. We are not blind and we can all see your support all over the State.\n\n\u201cYou have our support all the time because if we don\u2019t support you, it shows that we are ingrates and as a matter of fact, you deserve to be returned. It is our collective belief that you will do more and more for us\u201d, Aragberi added.\n\nAlayemore said: \u201cWe have never had it so good like this. If we look at what we have had since 2018, it has been so good. I can assure you with all sense of sincerity that your second term project is a done deal and a completed project.\n\n\u201cYou are a man of greatness and an achiever. You are a man of good character, integrity and honour. Since I have been on the throne about 20 years ago, no sitting Governor has ever come to visit us at the place of our monthly meeting except you. This means a lot to us. And we thank you for what you are doing in Ido-Osun in terms of infrastructure, among others.\u201d\n\nAddressing the traditional rulers in their palaces and members of his party at Awo and Ejigbo, Governor Oyetola expressed satisfaction at the warmth reception he has been given by the people of the State, particularly since the commencement of the strategic engagement tour.\n\nHe lauded the defectors for taking a bold step to defect to the ruling party just as he assured them of equal opportunity and treatment.\n\nGovernor Oyetola who urged the members of the party to troop out in large number on Saturday for the party\u2019s primary, noted that with God on his side, he was confident of victory as there\u2019s no need of changing the winning team.\n\nWhile receiving the defectors into the party, the APC State Chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun, expressed gratitude to the new members for seeing good reasons to join the progressives family.",

          "text": "University teachers in Nigeria are to commence a four-week strike starting on Monday, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has said.\n\nThe union announced this as part of its resolutions at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Lagos Monday morning.\n\n\u201c\u2026 NEC resolved to embark on a four-week roll-over total and comprehensive strike action beginning from Monday 14th February 2022,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 stated.\n\nReasons for industrial action\n\nAddressing the media at Tayo Aderinokun auditorium at the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, the union\u2019s president, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke listed as reasons for the strike, the government\u2019s failure to implement the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Memorandum of Action (MoA) signed between the union and the government; the government\u2019s poor commitment to the payment of academic earned allowance (EAA); the continued use of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System and refusal to adopt the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), and proliferation of the universities in the country.\n\nASUU also accused the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board(JAMB) of encroaching on the statutory roles of the Senates of universities over the admission of candidates by the institutions.\n\nThe union also frowned at the recent appointment of Nigeria\u2019s minister of communications and digital economy, Isa Ibrahim, as a professor at a federal university (FUTO) and threatened to sanction all those it said took part in the processes leading to what it described as the illegal appointment.\n\nOn IPPIS\n\nSpeaking on IPPIS, the union in its communiqu\u00e9, said: \u201cThe imposition of this grotesque platform challenged our union to develop an alternative system to IPPIS \u2013 the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS). This locally developed and cost-effective alternative payment platform has the distinct capacity to check corruption and preserve the hard-earned autonomy of Nigerian universities for the good of the country. Regrettably, FGN is still foot-dragging over its adoption, contrary to an earlier agreement with our union, thereby allowing the financial chaos heralded by IPPIS to continue.\u201d\n\nOn EAA\n\nASUU said: \u201cCompatriots of the press, the Federal Government promised to mainstream the EAA into the annual federal budget in the various memoranda signed with ASUU and the Government recently released N221 billion for payment of some EAA allowances. However, many years of unpaid entitlements are outstanding, serving as triggers for industrial crisis in our universities.\u201d\n\nOn visitation panel\n\nThe union condemned what it termed the continued delay in the release of the white papers on the reports of the visitation panels to the universities. The panels were set up by the government.\n\n\u201cSending Visitation Panels to universities on a periodic (5-yearly) basis is a critical evaluation requirement stipulated in our university laws. Our Union had to embark on an action for the FGN to institute such panels. However, many months after the panels submitted their reports, the White Papers are yet to be released. We call for the immediate release of the White Papers to address numerous lapses in the administration of Nigeria\u2019s federal universities,\u201d ASUU said.\n\nAppeal for support\n\nMeanwhile, the union pleaded with Nigerians for understanding, saying the declaration of the strike became very important to preserve the sanctity of the Nigerian university system.\n\n\u201cComrades and compatriots, it was a painful decision for NEC to arrive at the roll-over strike option. Contrary to the views canvassed in some quarters, our union loathes to disrupt academic activities on our campuses. We love our students and respect their parents and guardians. We are also not insensitive to the genuine concerns about stable academic calendars in public universities expressed by patriotic Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria. But the blame should be squarely put at the doorsteps of those who have ignored our patriotic yearnings for a development-oriented education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe patience of our members has been tasked beyond tolerable limits. The greatest asset of any nation is its human capital. Any nation that pays lip service to education as we currently witness in Nigeria will only grow in age and never experience genuine development. We therefore seek the understanding and support of all stakeholders to make the Nigerian government more responsive to issues of human capital development including health and education,\u201d the union said.\n\nNANS warns\n\nThe National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has rejected planned strike by ASUU.\n\nThe union threatened to embark on actions including confrontation to make sure that the strike is suspended and students and lecturers go back to classes.\n\nSpeaking in an interview, NANS President Asefon Sunday lamented that the Nigerian students were always at the receiving end of the skirmishes between the government and ASUU.\n\nAsefon said: \u201cWe are not supporting ASUU; we are not supporting the federal government. And whatever we are going to do to make sure we return to class is what we are going to do. And I assure you in the next 24-hours, you are going to see action around this country.\n\n\u201cWe are going to use the last \u201cC\u201d, which is confrontation. We are going to use confrontation to make sure that our lecturers are back to school.\n\n\u201cAny moment from now, you will be reading our actions across the nation. The federal government and ASUU are going to see the wrath of Nigerian students.\u201d\n\nThe union said the impact of the last nine-month strike suspended in December 2020 by the union is still being felt across universities.\n\n\u201cWhen two elephants fight, the grass suffers. Nigerian students have always been at the receiving end. We have been the ones suffering.\u201d\n\nNANS Seeks ministers\u2019 removal\n\nAsefon faulted what he described as the failure of the government to address the issues with ASUU for more than a decade.\n\nThe union called on President Muhammad Buhari to sack the ministers of labour and education, Chris Ngige and Adamu Adamu, respectively, accusing them of insincerity in addressing the union\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to take it. And we are rejecting it. And we are calling on the federal government to remove the ministers of labour and education. We need clear headed people. We need people who are sincere,\u201d he said.\n\nNANS blames ASUU\n\nWhile it accused the Nigerian government of insincerity, NANS also alleged that ASUU does not consider the interest of students when taking actions.\n\nIt lamented that ASUU does not carry along NANS in all its activities even though the students are always at the receiving end of ASUU\u2019s issues with the government.\n\nThe NANS president added that ASUU has offended the Nigerian students for not being able to agree with the government during the last nine-month prolonged strike, and wondered if the same issues could be addressed in one month.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, we understand and believe that everything they are asking for is for the benefit of the Nigerian students but you cannot be asking something for me, as a Nigerian student, and you are not carrying us along. We are also stakeholders in the education sector.\n\n\u201cHow many times has ASUU as a sister union called the Nigerian students to inform us that this is what is going on? When the new President of ASUU came on board, I tried every possible means as a President of NANS to reach out to him. But he will be telling me to go and relate with the ASUU chairman in my school. Am I the president of SUG in my school?\n\n\u201cFor those nine months they could not achieve anything and they are now saying they are going for a one-month warning strike. What kind of a warning strike is that?\u201d he wondered. (Premium Times)",

          "text": "The Nigeria Police Force has arrested former Commander IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT), DCP Abba Kyari, and four other police officers over their involvement in a case of alleged criminal conspiracy, discreditable, unethical, and unprofessional conduct, official corruption and tampering with exhibits in a case of illicit drug trafficking involving a perpetual transnational drug cartel.\n\nKyari was suspended and came under investigation for an alleged fraudulent deal with Rahman Abbas otherwise known as Hushpuppi in the United States of America.\n\nJust recently, the Police Service Commission (PCS) ordered a new panel on the saga to turn in its report in two weeks.\n\nFresh case\n\nIn a statement Monday in Abuja, Deputy Force Public Relations Officer CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi said the latest arrest of Kyari alongside some officers was sequel to pieces of information received from the leadership of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) February 10, 2022.\n\nAdejobi said the IGP had also ordered the transfer of the case to NDLEA, even as he charged the NDLEA to also investigate the indicted officers of the agency.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cIn line with standard administrative procedure of the Force, the Inspector General of Police ordered a high-level, discreet, and in-house investigation into the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe interim investigations report revealed that two international drug couriers identified as Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus, both males, were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu on January 19, 2022, upon their arrival from Addis Ababa aboard an Ethiopian Airlines flight ET917.\n\n\u201cThe arrest led to the recovery of substantial quantity of powdery substance suspected to be cocaine from the two narcotic couriers. The operation which was intelligence-driven was undertaken by a Unit of the IRT.\n\n\u201cAlthough the case and the two suspects were subsequently transferred to the NDLEA on January 25, 2022, the findings of the in-house investigation ordered by the Inspector General of Police established reasonable grounds for strong suspicion that the IRT officers involved in the operation could have been involved in some underhand and unprofessional dealings as well as official corruption which compromised ethical standards in their dealings with the suspects and exhibits recovered.\n\n\u201cBeyond this, the Police investigation also established that the international narcotics cartel involved in this case have strong ties with some officers of the NDLEA at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, who are on their pay roll.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers confirmed that the modus is for the transnational drug barons to conspire with the NDLEA officers on duty and send them their pre-boarding photographs for identification, seamless clearance, and unhindered passage out of the airport with the narcotics being trafficked.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers also confirmed that they have been enjoying this relationship with the NDLEA officers at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport since 2021 and had in this instant case on January 19, 2022, been identified and cleared by the NDLEA officers as customary, having received their pre-departure photographs and other details prior to their arrival in Enugu, and were on their way out with the narcotics when they were apprehended by the Police.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Police investigations report also indicted DCP Abba Kyari, who had been on suspension for his alleged involvement in a different fraud case being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), for complicity in the allegation of official corruption, tampering with narcotics exhibit and sundry unprofessional conducts that negate the standard administrative and investigative protocols of the Force as well as extant criminal laws.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s involvement in these allegations occurred while his suspension from service was subsisting. On the strength of the findings of the in-house Police Investigation Panel, the IGP has ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of all the indicted police officers to the NDLEA authorities for conclusive investigation, while appropriate disciplinary actions are also being initiated against them by the Force leadership.\n\n\u201cThe concerned officers include DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, ASP John Umoru (at large), Inspector Simon Agrigba, and John Nuhu. They have all been, accordingly, handed over today February 14, 2022 to the NDLEA authorities.\n\n\u201cIn so doing, the Inspector General of Police has also formally requested that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency should ensure the identification, arrest and investigation of the Agency\u2019s officers who have also been found to be colluding with the international drug cartel involved in this case towards advancing the anti-narcotics agenda of the federal government,\u201d Adejobi further said.\n\nHe quoted the IGP as assuring the public of his administration\u2019s commitment to upholding the tenets and values of policing in line with the agenda of ethical regeneration, restoration of professional standard, enhancement of the anti-corruption drive, respect for the rule of law and inter-agency collaboration in the drive to stabilise the internal security order of the country.\n\nAll in our custody- NDLEA\n\nMeanwhile, few hours after he was declared wanted by the NDLEA over his involvement in a drug deal, the Nigerian Police Force has handed over the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force, to the anti-narcotic agency.\n\nA statement by Director NDLEA Media and Advocacy, FemiBabafemi said: \u201cFive of the wanted suspects namely: DCP Abba Kyari; ACP Sunday J. Ubua; ASP Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba and Inspector John Nuhu were driven into the National Headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja at about 5pm on Monday 14th February to formally hand them over for interrogation and further investigation.\n\n\u201cThe Agency wishes to assure that no stone will be left unturned to ensure that all suspects already in custody and those that may still be indicted in the course of investigation will face the full weight of the law at the end of the ongoing probe.\u201d",

          "title": "UPDATED: Buhari Earmarks N2.5tn For Subsidy In Supplementary Budget Proposal To NASS",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has submitted the 2022 Appropriation amendment proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nIn the amendment proposal, the President earmarked the sum of N2.557 trillion for fuel subsidy.\n\nThe amendment proposal is contained in a six-page letter sent to the House on Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter, President Buhari is asking the National Assembly to approve the sum of N2.557 trillion supplementary budget for petrol subsidy from July to December 2022.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila read the letter in their respective chambers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Northern Youths Kick Against Atiku\u2019s Presidential Ambition, Demand Power Shift To South\n\nIn the letter, President Muhammadu Buhari said the amendment is necessary to accommodate some issues in the country including Petroleum Subsidy which must be considered.\n\nHe is also asking the National Assembly to review the Finance Act 2021.\n\nAccordingly, President Muhammadu Buhari in the letter said it was imperative to remove all capital projects that were replicated on the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\nRead the full letter written by the President to the NASS below\u2026\n\nThe full text of the letter entitled, \u201cSUBMISSION OF THE 2022 APPROPRIATION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\u201d, reads:\n\n\u201cAs l indicated at the signing of the 2022 Appropriation Act, I forward herewith the Proposals for amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act (as detailed in Schedules I-V), for the kind consideration and approval by the Senate.\n\n\u201cLet me seize this opportunity to once again express my deep gratitude to the leadership and members of the Senate for the expeditious consideration and passage of the 2022 Appropriation Bill as well as the enabling 2021 Finance Bill.\n\n\u201cIt has become necessary to present this amendment proposal considering the impacts of the recent suspension of the Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy removal and the adverse implications that some changes made by the National\n\nAssembly in the 2022 Appropriation Act could have for the successful implementation of the budget.\n\n\u201cIt is important to restore the provisions made for various key capital projects in the 2022 Executive Proposal (see details in Schedule l) that were cut by the National Assembly. This is to ensure that critical ongoing projects that are cardinal to this administration, and those nearing completion, do not suffer a setback due to reduced funding.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to reinstate the N25.81 billion cut from the provision for the Power Sector Reform Programme in order to meet the Federal Government\u2019s commitment under the financing plan agreed with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it is necessary to reinstate the four (4) capital projects totaling N1.42 billion in the Executive Proposal for the Federal Ministry of Water Resources that were removed in the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to restore the N3 billion cut from the provision made for payment of mostly long outstanding Local Contractors\u2019 Debts and Other Liabilities as part of our strategy to reflate the economy and spur growth (see Schedule I).\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that the inclusion of National Assembly\u2019s expenditures in the Executive Budget negates the principles of separation of Powers and financial autonomy of the Legislature. It is therefore necessary to transfer the National Assembly\u2019s expenditures totaling N16.59 billion in the Service Wide Vote to the National Assembly Statutory Transfer provision (see Schedule l).\n\n\u201cIt is also imperative to reinstate the N22.0 billion cut from the provision for Sinking Fund to Retire Mature Loans to ensure that government can meet its obligations under already issued bonds as and when they mature.\n\n\u201cThe cuts made from provisions for the recurrent spending of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Missions, which are already constrained, are capable of causing serious embarrassment to the country as they mostly relate to office and residential rentals.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the reductions in provisions for allowances payable to personnel of the Nigerian Navy and Police Formations and Commands could create serious issues for government. It is therefore imperative that these provisions be restored as proposed (see Schedule II).\n\n\u201cIt is also absolutely necessary to remove all capital projects is that replicated in the 2022 Appropriation Act; 139 out of the 254 such projects totaling N13.24 billion have been identified to be deleted from the budget.\n\n\u201cSome significant and non-mandate projects were introduced in the budgets of the Ministry of Transportation, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (see Schedule III). There are several other projects that have been included by the National Assembly in the budgets of agencies that are outside their mandate areas. The Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning has been directed to work with your relevant Committees to comprehensively identify and realign all such misplaced projects.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to restore the title /descriptions of 32 projects in the Appropriation Act to the titles contained in the Executive Proposal for the Ministry of Water Resources (see Schedule IV) in furtherance of our efforts to complete and put to use critical agenda projects.\n\n\u201cThe Appropriation Amendment request is for a total sum of N106,161,499,052 (One hundred and six billion, one hundred and sixty-one million, four hundred and ninety-nine thousand, and fifty-two Naira only) for Capital Expenditures and N43,870,592,044 (Forty-three billion, eight hundred and seventy million, five hundred and ninety-two thousand, and forty-four Naira only) for Recurrent Expenditures. I, therefore, request the National Assembly to make the above amendments without increasing the budget deficit. I urge you to roll back some of the N887.99 billion of projects earlier inserted in the budget by the National Assembly to accommodate these amendments.\n\n\u201cHowever, following the suspension of the PMS subsidy removal, the 2022 Budget Framework has been revised to fully provide for PMS subsidy (see Schedule V). An additional provision of N2.557 trillion will be required to fund the petrol subsidy in 2022. Consequently, the Federation ACCOunt (Main Pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.00 trillion, while FGN\u2019s share from the Account is projected to reduce by N1.05 trillion. Therefore, the amount available to fund the FGN Budget is projected to decline by N969.09 billion.\n\n\u201cAggregate expenditure is projected to increase by N45.85 billion, due to additional domestic debt service provision of N102.5 billion net of the reductions in Statutory Transfers by N56.67 billion, as follows: NDDC, by N12.61 billion from N102.78 billion to N90.18 billion; NEDC, by N5.90 billion from N48.08 billion to N42.18 billion; UBEC, by N19.08 billion from N112.29 billion to N93.21 billion; Basic Health Care Fund, byN 9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion; and NASENI, by N9.54 billion from N56.14 billion to N46.60 billion.\n\n\u201cTotal budget deficit is projected to increase by N1.01 trillion to N7.40 trillion, representing 4.01% of GDP. The incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\n\u201cEqually, it is imperative that Clause 10 of the 2022 Appropriation Act which stipulates that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) are authorized to charge and defray from all money standing in credit to the units as revenues, penalties or sanctions at 10% for the technical setup and operational cost at the units in this financial year be repealed.\n\n\u201cThis clause is in conflict with the Act establishing these Agencies, as well as some other laws and financial regulations of the government. These are neither Revenue Generating Agencies nor Regulatory Bodies that generate revenue or charge penalty fees. They are fully funded (Personnel, Overhead, and Capital) by Government through Budgetary provisions.\n\n\u201cThe Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007, as well as the Finance Act 2021, require these Agencies to remit fully any recovered funds to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). This clause may lay dangerous precedence, and spark clamours for similar treatment by other anti-corruption agencies.\n\n\u201cAlso, Clause 11 stipulates that \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of any other law in force, Nigerian Embassies and Missions are authorised to expend funds allocated to them under the Capital components without having to seek approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u201d should likewise be repealed. It too is inconsistent with extant Financial Regulations and the Public Procurement Act, which set thresholds for approving officers and Parastatal / Ministerial Tenders Boards for awards of Contracts for the procurement of goods and Services. This also amounts to an intrusion of the Legislature into what is an executive function.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency of the request for amendments, I I seek the cooperation of the National Assembly for expeditious legislative action on the 2022 Appropriation Amendment Proposal in order to sustain the gains of an early passage of the budget.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Distinguished Senate President, the assurances of my highest consideration.\u201d",

          "title": "How Abba Kyari Proposed Sale Of 25kg Cocaine, Offered $61,400 To NDLEA Officers",
          "text": "A full briefing by the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has revealed how suspended police officer DCP Abba Kyari, proposed to sell about 25kg of cocaine and offered undercover NDLEA officers the sum of $61,400.\n\nBefore his suspension over links with convicted fraudster Hushpuppi, Mr Kyari was the Commander of tbe Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nSpokesman of the NDLEA, Femi Babafemi in a briefing on Monday revealed that the embattled cop is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, an accusation to which he needs to answer questions.\n\nREAD ALSO: Police Arrest Abba Kyari, Four Other Officers\n\nAccording to Babafemi, Kyari had initiated a call to one of its officers on Friday, January 21, 2022.\n\n\u201cWhen the officer returned the call two minutes later, Kyari informed him he was coming to see him, to discuss an operational matter after the Juma\u2019at service,\u201d Mr Babafemi explained.\n\n\u201cHe appeared at the agreed venue of the meeting with the officer and went straight to the crux of the matter. This was it: His team had intercepted and arrested some traffickers that came into the country from Ethiopia with, according to him, 25kg of cocaine. He proposed a drug deal whereby he and his team are to take 15kg of the cocaine and leave 10kg for the prosecution of the suspects arrested with the illicit drug in Enugu. In the meantime, the purloined cocaine will be replaced with a dummy worth 15kg. He asked the NDLEA officer to persuade men of the FCT Command, to play along as well.\n\n\u201cBy 11: 05 am on Monday, January 24, after the Agency gave the officer the green light to play along, he and Kyari began a WhatsApp call for the rest of the day. The officer conveyed \u201ctheir\u201d willingness to play the game.\n\n\u201cAt this point, Kyari disclosed that the 15kg (already taken out) was shared between the informants that provided information for the seizure and himself and his men of the IRT of the Nigerian Police. According to him, the informants were given 7kg while his team took 8kg which was already sold.\n\n\u201cHe then offered to pay the NDLEA team (that is the officer and the FCT commander) by selling, on their behalf, half of the remaining 10kg, thereby further reducing the original cocaine for the prosecution to just 5kg. At N7m per kilogram, the proceed from the 5kg would amount to N35m, at the exchange rate of N570 per dollar being the black market rate for the day, January 24, 2022. In effect, he would be delivering $61, 400 to the NDLEA team. He put pressure on our officer to wrap up the arrangement with the commander of the FCT Command to take custody of the drug and suspects from his men who were on ground in Abuja. At the time, he was speaking from Lagos, where he allegedly travelled for private business.\n\n\u201cThe next day January 25, Kyari offered to send his younger brother to deliver the payment while his men deliver the suspects, but our officer turned down the suggestion, insisting he would rather deal with him in person and was therefore prepared to wait for him to return from Lagos.\n\n\u201cAnd by 5: 23 pm, Kyari was in Abuja and met with the officer at the same rendezvous where they had the first meeting. In their discussion, he disclosed how his team received the information from a double-crosser who betrayed the traffickers to him, showing a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld; he narrated how acting on the tip-off, his team departed Abuja to Enugu and arrested the traffickers, removed part of the consignment on his instruction and replaced same with dummies. He also indicated how to identify the remnant of the original cocaine that would be delivered to NDLEA, five original packages marked with red dots. The reason for this was to avoid the dummies being subjected to test. He forwarded a picture of the marked original cocaine package. According to the plan, once the 5kg cocaine has been tested in the presence of the suspects and confirmed positive, there would be no need to test the remaining ones, being dummies.\n\n\u201cHe also brought with him the money from the sale of the 5kg share of the NDLEA team, a total of $61, 400. Our officer, however, preferred to take the money inside his car. Well, the car was wired with sound and video recorders.\u201d\n\nThe NDLEA spokesman explained that relevant channels of communication were duly followed in the demand for Kyari without any result and as such the NDLEA cannot continue to keep other suspects in the case indefinitely while the principal suspect fails to honour official invitation.\n\n\u201cNDLEA has the mandate to take custody of suspects and consignments of drugs seized by other arms of law enforcement and there is a standard protocol for such transfer.\n\n\u201cThis we duly followed. The suspects and drugs were delivered to us on February 8 but the last part of the process, yet to be completed, is the debriefing of Kyari,\u201d Mr Babafemi stated.\n\n\u201cDCP Abba Kyari was invited by NDLEA for debriefing on Thursday February 10 through two main channels because there is a whole lot of questions begging for answers. The invitation was legitimate and formal according to our protocol. But up till the close of office hours on Friday, February 11, he refused to respond. Up till this moment, he hasn\u2019t responded. We are a law-abiding agency of government. We follow due process. In that vein, we will not detain suspects beyond the stipulated period according to the law before we charge them to court. And Kyari must be debriefed before the suspects are arraigned in court.\n\n\u201cHaving failed to honour the official invitation, NDLEA has no option but to declare DCP Abba Kyari of the Nigerian Police WANTED, right from this very moment, the NDLEA spokesman declared.",

The operation which was intelligence-driven was undertaken by a unit of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nStrong Ties\n\nWhile the case and the two suspects were transferred to the NDLEA on January 25, Adejobi explained that the findings of the in-house investigation ordered by the police chief established \u201creasonable grounds for strong suspicion\u201d that the IRT officers involved in the operation could have been involved in some underhand and unprofessional dealings, as well as official corruption which compromised ethical standards in their dealings with the suspects and exhibits recovered.\n\nHe added that beyond this, the police investigation also established that the international narcotics cartel involved in the case had \u201cstrong ties\u201d with some officers of the NDLEA at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu who were said to be on their payroll.\n\nThe two arrested drug couriers, according to the police spokesman, confirmed that the modus is for the transnational drug barons to conspire with the NDLEA officers on duty and send them their pre-boarding photographs for identification, seamless clearance, and unhindered passage out of the airport with the narcotics being trafficked.\n\n\u201cThe two arrested drug couriers also confirmed that they have been enjoying this relationship with the NDLEA officers at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport since 2021 and had in this instant case of 19th January 2022, been identified and cleared by the NDLEA officers as customary, having received their pre-departure photographs and other details prior to their arrival in Enugu, and were on their way out with the narcotics when they were apprehended by the police,\u201d Adejobi recounted.\n\n\u201cThe police investigations report also indicted DCP Abba Kyari, who has been on suspension for his alleged involvement in a different fraud case being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), for complicity in the allegation of official corruption, tampering with narcotics exhibit and sundry unprofessional conducts that negate the standard administrative and investigative protocols of the force, as well as extant criminal laws.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s involvement in these allegations occurred while his suspension from service was subsisting. On the strength of the findings of the in-house Police Investigation Panel, the Inspector-General of Police ordered the immediate arrest and transfer of all the indicted police officers to the NDLEA authorities for conclusive investigation, while appropriate disciplinary actions are also being initiated against them by the Force leadership.\n\n\u201cThe concerned officers include DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday Ubuah, ASP Bawa James, ASP John Umoru (at large), Inspr.

          "text": "Strolling through the town of Maymana, the new mayor appears to inspire goodwill from war-weary constituents in the Afghan provincial capital.\n\nBut Damullah Mohibullah Mowaffaq has a reputation as one of the top snipers in the ranks of the Taliban, until last summer waging war to take control of the country.\n\nMowaffaq was made mayor of Maymana, capital of Faryab province in the far reaches of northwest Afghanistan, in November, three months after the Taliban ousted the Western-backed government and seized power.\n\nHe rose to prominence as a fighter, but now his schedule is packed with the daily tasks of local government \u2014 unblocking sewers, planning roads, and smoothing over neighbourhood quarrels.\n\nHis switch reflects the broader transformation that the Taliban are undergoing, as the insurgents grapple with administering the territory.\n\nREAD ALSO: Indonesia Teacher Sentenced To Life In Prison For Rape Of 13 Students\n\n\u201cWhen I was fighting my objectives were very specific: to end the foreign occupation, discrimination and injustice,\u201d the 25-year-old told AFP.\n\n\u201cNow my goals are also clear: to fight corruption and make the country prosper.\u201d\n\n\u2018Ups and downs\u2019\n\nOn a walk through the streets of Maymana, the new mayor talks with municipal workers clearing roadside gutters.\n\nResidents of the city of 100,000 approaches with complaints and suggestions, which are dutifully added to an ever-growing to-do list.\n\n\u201cThe new mayor is young, well-educated and, very importantly, from the city,\u201d says his non-Taliban deputy, Sayed Ahmad Shah Gheyasi.\n\n\u201cHe knows how to deal with people.\u201d\n\nUnlike the poor, madrassa-educated rural men who make up the Taliban rank and file, Mowaffaq comes from a family of wealthy traders and grew up in Maymana, where he excelled at school and in sport.\n\nMemorabilia from his youth decorates his office including a certificate from a martial arts competition as well as his high school diploma.\n\nAfter joining the insurgency at 19, he was promoted to command a small unit deployed in Faryab province.\n\nOthers describe him as one of the Taliban\u2019s most talented snipers, although he appears reluctant to be drawn into telling war stories.\n\nBut on walkabout with AFP he pauses in front of a house blemished with munition marks near the village of Doraye Khoija Qoshre, where his unit once held sway.\n\nHere he used to hide himself away, scoping American troops with his rifle and honing a reputation as a crack shot.\n\n\u201cHe killed an American with his rifle from this house, then a plane came and bombed him,\u201d said Saifaddin, a local farmer, who like many in Afghanistan goes by one name.\n\nAlthough it cannot be confirmed Mowaffaq was responsible, in mid-2019 the United States announced a member of their special forces had been killed in fighting in Faryab.\n\nA year earlier, the Afghan Analysts Network said Maymana was \u201cpractically under siege\u201d owing to \u201can astonishingly widespread Taliban presence\u201d.\n\nMowaffaq witnessed several comrades killed in the fighting but remains evasive about the horrors he both inflicted and suffered.\n\n\u201cI have had many ups and downs,\u201d he says.\n\nUnconventional totem\n\nThe United Nations and rights groups have accused the Taliban of gross human rights abuses since they seized power in August.\n\nThe deaths of more than 100 members of the former government or security forces have been blamed on the country\u2019s new rulers, while women activists have been detained and journalists were beaten for covering their protests.\n\nThe Taliban ideal of a thick beard and black turban may frame Mowaffaq\u2019s face, but in many ways he is an unconventional totem of their austere ideology.\n\nNationwide the Islamists have effectively evicted women from the public sphere, shutting older girls out of education and largely barring the opposite sex from the workplace.\n\nBut in Mowaffaq\u2019s office, female employees have been allowed to keep working, and a public garden in the city is reserved for them.\n\nUnder the first Taliban regime from 1996 to 2001, the all-covering burqa was mandatory for women.\n\nThis time religious police have stopped short of making the same diktat \u2014 although they have issued orders for women in the capital to cover their faces.\n\nIn the Maymana mayor\u2019s office, \u201cnobody tells us how to dress,\u201d said Qahera, his 26-year-old female director of human resources, who wears a hijab in line with current dress requirements.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s lightning takeover of Afghanistan took even the movement\u2019s members by surprise.\n\nTheir efforts to run the country are hamstrung by sheer inexperience, brain drain, a humanitarian crisis, and pressure from Western powers which have frozen assets.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "The Chief Executive Officer of Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), Mr. Bismarck Rewane, has advised Nigerians not to entertain the illusion that the Dangote Refinery would guarantee them cheaper supply of refined petroleum products.\n\nRewane said the most the Dangote refinery would guarantee was improved supply of petrol in Nigeria\u2019s domestic market, but would not affect the foreign exchange position of Nigeria significantly.\n\nHe said this on Monday, during the 2022 virtual economic outlook organised by the Stanbic IBTC Group, where he projected that the refinery would become operational in the Q1 2023.\n\nRewane said: \u201cNobody should expect that the Dangote Refinery is going to make petrol cheaper (in Nigeria). It is going to make it more available at any point in time. I doubt it whether he is going to collect his money in Naira because Dangote has costs.\n\n\u201cDangote Refinery technically and theoretically is outside Nigeria as it is situated at the export processing zone. We have a deep sea ports where the ships will take the refined products. But rather than buying from Amsterdam we will buy from Dangote and ship to Atlas Cove, Bonny and Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe saving (to Nigeria economy) is that rather than shipping a tanker from Amsterdam to Nigeria, we will be shipping it from Lekki. Another savings is because Dangote refinery is 45 percent more efficient than other refineries because of its cutting edge technology. This will further reduce the cost.\u201d\n\nHe said what would happen was that Nigeria would take 450,000 barrels and make it available to Dangote under a swap arrangement instead of giving it to refineries in Europe.\n\nThe CEO of the FDC said taking the crude to Dangote Refinery would be quicker than shipping it to, and bringing the refined products from Europe.\n\n\u201cI think that it is quite clear that it will not solve all our foreign exchange problems because it does not change things much. So, it is wrong notion to say that we spend all our money (FX) importing fuel.\n\n\u201cNo, it is our own fuel that is being refined for us abroad, which will now reside with Dangote. Apart from that I do not think that there is any much difference. The reason is that the price differential will probably be on transportation cost. It is not going to change dramatically our foreign exchange situation,\u201d he said.\n\nRewane also pointed out that that the Nigerian government was in a precarious financial position because, \u201cwe have a situation now where the government is desperate. There is a shortfall in government financing cannot be fixed through subsidy removal.\u201d\n\nHe said the unsung economic reality in 2022, was that Nigeria would be the poverty capital of the world as ordinary Nigerians on the bottom of economic ladder would spend 101 per cent (sic) of their official income on foods alone.\n\nRewane said food inflation could force many Nigerians to switch to substitutes to actually reducing the amount of food they are consuming.\n\n\u201cA study last year said that 25 per cent of Nigerians are consuming less in quantity than what they were consuming earlier while 50 per cent are consuming less quality than they are consuming previously. This will compromise their immune system and render them more fragile for other reasons.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, 63 million Nigerians were gainfully employed in Nigeria. In 2020 it dropped to 31 million people that were fully employed. That is why we are having kidnapping,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEO of StanbicIBTC Holdings, Mr. Demola Sogunle, said that the event was to discuss investment and planning as election period draws near.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPC) has withdrawn all the methanol blended petrol which was imported into the country about three weeks ago.\n\nThe NNPC also stated that cargoes of clean petrol are arriving daily into the country to bridge the gap created by the withdrawal of the methanol blended petrol.\n\nThe off-spec petrol, according to the NNPC, was imported into the country by four oil marketers through four cargoes under the company\u2019s Direct Sales Direct Purchase (DSDP) arrangement.\n\nThe four companies that were alleged to have supplied the methanol-blended petrol were: MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium through vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, and Duke Oil through MT Nord Gainer vessel. Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi, MRS and Oando have since denied this claim in press statements made available to the public.\n\nThe product was purchased from international trader, LITASCO and delivered with MT Nord Gainer loaded through the LITASCO loading port terminal in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThe NNPC moved to halt the situation by ensuring that the methanol blended petrol do not get to the filling stations.\n\nIn achieving this, the NNPC made sure that all the cargoes that were suspected to have methanol were quarantined, while all the trucks that have left the depots were tracked and intercepted.\n\nThe NNPC also restocked the depot with cleaner fuels and sent officials to inspect all the filling stations to ensure that they do not have the petrol that had excessive methanol.\n\nIn addition, the NNPC intensified efforts at increasing the supply of petrol into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\n\nA former Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Kayode Opeifa, said the action taken by the NNPC in mitigating the potential crisis that would have been caused if the entire contaminated fuel had entered the Nigerian market was timely.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is what you would expect in this kind of situation. You quarantine the quantity, withdraw those in circulation and then begin investigation and that is the stage that I believe that we should be concerned with so that we don\u2019t have damages beyond what we \u2018ve had.\n\n\u201cTo that effect, as someone in the transport sector with analytical chemistry background, I think so far for the public, that is adequate. The product is withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe need to be procedural in handling this matter. Vehicles are damaged but it\u2019s not a matter that should be handled based on emotions. We need to get answers to how it happened.\n\n\u201cWe have regulatory agencies and they have done the needful in terms of isolation, quarantine and restock. For the general public, what is important is that the product is no longer in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, different countries have different specs, however, there is a minimum standard and the minimum standard was what NNPC said the particular fuel failed to meet. He said that it is not unusual to miss the specs on chemical analysis.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual to have product defects. You have heard of car recalls, air bag recalls when they have gotten to the market. So, the best thing is to ensure that appropriate protocols are used to address this issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is the good news out of this whole thing that happened is that it was detected early enough, it was withdrawn within limited time and the fuel supply chain is gradually coming back to normal,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Uzoho",

          "title": "Nigeria: It\u2019s Buhari\u2019s Prerogative to Plan His Succession, Says Central Bank Chief Emefiele",
          "text": "In reaction to speculations around his purported interest in the 2023 presidential race which has seen a stampede by vested parties and interest, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele on Monday said it was the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession plan in line with global best practice, for good governance and continuing peace and progress of the country.\n\nEmefiele also stressed that he remained focused on his job, even as he has pledged to continue supporting the Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive.\n\nThese formed part of a statement titled; Who is Afraid of Emefiele? from the group known as \u2018FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE,\u2019 who disclosed that they met with the CBN governor to clarify his position on the 2023 presidential race.\n\nEmefiele, according to the group, also warned those that had resorted to all sorts of blackmail, sponsored articles and choreographed comments on social media targeted at tainting his image, impugning his character and legacy to desist from such act, stressing that it\u2019s God that anoints leaders and that he would leave his faith firmly in the hands of God.\n\nThe statement noted that in the past few weeks, there have been media reports on Emefiele\u2019s purported interest in the 2023 presidential race, leading to some interested parties and vested interests resorting to all sorts of blackmail, sponsored articles and choreographed comments on social media targeted at tainting Emefiele\u2019s image, impugning his character and legacy.\n\nIt pointed out that the negative attacks were being sponsored by those who see Emefiele as a major threat to their political ambition.\n\n\u201cTruth is Godwin Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone he is running for President even as he is constitutionally qualified to do so; he has been under pressure in the past few weeks as different groups have been putting up unsolicited campaign for his candidacy.\n\n\u201cOnly yesterday, as the speculation became widespread, a group of his friends under the aegis of FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE met with him to clarify his position. Here is what he told us:\n\n\u201cThat he remains focused on his job and will continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive; that in his career trajectory, right from his days as a young banker, he never asked, nor lobbied for a job, he was invited by the Board of Directors to be the Chief Executive Officer/Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank as he was an integral part of the team, led by founder Jim Ovia, that transformed Zenith Bank from a start-up to one of Africa\u2019s largest banks with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, South Africa, Dubai, China and the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nIt further pointed out that in 2014, President Goodluck Jonathan tapped him to be the CBN Governor, a job he didn\u2019t lobby for and in which his name was not among those being considered at that time and was not even from the geo-political zone that most people thought the job would go to as the president then was from same geopolitical zone with him.\n\nIt further quoted Emefiele to have said he, \u201cremains humbled by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant him an unprecedented second term as CBN Governor- again without lobbying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus he will continue to remain loyal to him and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Mr. Emefiele told us that he believes it\u2019s the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession in line with global best practices for good governance for the continuing peace and progress of the federal republic of Nigeria, as such he will play his part to stabilise the economy for an orderly transition.\n\n\u201cAnd given that it\u2019s God that anoints leaders, he will leave his faith firmly in the hands of God. With these fundamental questions settled, it is imperative to address some of the lies and utter falsehood being peddled by blackmailers and political jobbers who see Godwin Emefiele as a threat to their ambition,\u201d it stated.\n\nHighlighting his achievements since he assumed office in June 2014, they noted that then, his task was huge and the challenges seemed insurmountable, adding that today he has calmed the waters and put Nigeria back on the path of growth.\n\n\u201cAs you will recall there was a sharp fall in crude oil prices from 2015, which led to significant revenue shortfalls in Nigeria where crude oil represents about 95 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s export revenue. This created major shock for the Nigerian economy, leading to a 13-month recession in 2016.\n\n\u201cIn comparison to the previous years before Emefiele became the CBN governor, the average price of crude oil from 2010 to 2014 was over $100/barrel and this fell to some $30 / barrel with high production costs of some $25/barrel.\n\n\u201cDespite these challenges Emefiele\u2019s monetary policies supported the Buhari administration and all 36 State governments, ensuring salaries were paid and much more was done, with much less, in infrastructure, steering Nigeria away from much worse outcomes while many oil producers like Kuwait, Russia, Angola and Brunei had longer lasting recessions between of 20 \u2013 60 months,\u201d it stated.\n\nAdditionally, FRIENDS OF EMEFIELE urged critics to also understand that the second recession the country entered into in 2020 was as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThen, the global economy (Nigeria inclusive) was plunged into recession because of the pandemic which was unprecedented. It led to declines in economic activities and lockdown across the world.\n\nThey pointed out that countries such as the United States had their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) falling in 2020 by -31 per cent in the second quarter (Q2) of that year; the United Kingdom by -19.4 per cent in Q2; European Union by -14.1 per cent in Q2 and Nigeria, with deft response of the CBN had -6.1 per cent in Q2.\n\n\u201cAs we all know the CBN supported fiscal authorities in the following areas. N100 billion health sector credit facility for operators in the sector. Today, Nigeria boasts of two world-class cancer centres in Lagos and medical tourism has reduced.\n\n\u201cA one-year extension of a moratorium on principal repayments for CBN intervention facilities; the reduction of the interest rate on intervention loans from nine per cent to five per cent; strengthening of the loan-to-deposit ratio policy (i.e. stepped up enforcement of directive to extend more credit to the private sector),\u201d it stated.\n\nThe group listed other measures introduced by the Emefiele-led CBN to include the creation of N400 billion target credit facility for affected households and small and medium enterprises; granting regulatory forbearance to banks to restructure terms of facilities in affected sectors; improving FX supply to the CBN by directing oil companies and oil servicing companies to sell FX to the CBN rather than the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and additional N100 billion intervention fund in healthcare loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners intending to expand/build capacity.\n\nThe group added: \u201cDespite the challenges, the CBN under Emefiele has in the last seven years maintained a developmental-oriented approach in supporting the federal government to address challenges across various sectors of the economy and has initiated far-reaching reforms.\n\n\u201cOne issue the critics have continued to raise is the issue of the rice pyramid which was recently unveiled in Abuja. But these arm chair critics have failed to understand that through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), an initiative that was introduced by the Emefiele-led CBN, the lives of a lot of rural farmers have been transformed.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramid which had taken place previously in Minna, Kebbi, Gombe, Ekiti and Abuja, showed how Emefiele has used agriculture to support the federal government\u2019s wars on insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramids were build bag by bag in all the states the programme had been launched since December 2020, when it was first launched in Minna, Niger State. The programme held last month to unveil the world\u2019s largest rice pyramid in Abuja was also an initiative of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN).\u201d\n\nIt noted that from an average yield of 1.8 metric tonnes per hectare in the pre-ABP era, the initiative has increased the country\u2019s average yield per hectare for rice paddy and maize to about five metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant reduction in the country\u2019s rice import bill, from a monstrous $1.05 billion prior to November 2015, to the current figure of $18.50 million, annually, the group noted.\n\n\u201cEmefiele also spearheaded the creation of the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), an initiative that brought all the private sector business leaders under an umbrella in the fight against the spread of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis was why in its latest Article IV Consultation released in February 2022, the International Monetary Fund praised Nigeria\u2019s effort in fighting the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThere are many other measures announced by the CBN Governor which will be detailed in due course like the support to Technology, Digital innovation, the Creative Industries and the 15 Trillion Infrastructure corporation recently launched.\n\n\u201cApparently, those behind the sponsored negative reports are afraid of Emefiele\u2019s towering personality and service to Nigeria. But they must understand that he cannot be stampeded any way. He is focused on delivering the mandate of the Central Bank; he is rebuilding the economy of the country through import substitution policies and using agriculture to create a new rural middle class from ground up.\n\n\u201cThose who continue to criticise the rice pyramid are too ashamed of giving glory to whom it is due. Emefiele is focused on his unfinished job and should not be distracted,\u201d the statement added.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "text": "Novak Djokovic has said he would rather miss out on future tennis trophies than be forced to get a Covid vaccine.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to the BBC, he said he should not be associated with the anti-vax movement, but supported an individual\u2019s right to choose.\n\nDjokovic was asked if he would sacrifice taking part in competitions such as Wimbledon and the French Open over his stance on the vaccine\n\n\u201cYes, that is the price that I\u2019m willing to pay,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 20-times Grand Slam winner was deported from Australia last month after the government cancelled his visa in a row over his vaccine status.\n\nDjokovic, who is the world\u2019s number one men\u2019s tennis player, said he had obtained a medical exemption to enter the country to play in the Australian Open as he had recently recovered from Covid-19.\n\nHowever, the country\u2019s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, personally cancelled the 34-year-old\u2019s visa, on the grounds that his presence could incite \u201ccivil unrest\u201d and encourage anti-vaccine sentiment.\n\n\u201cI was never against vaccination,\u201d he told the BBC, confirming that he\u2019d had vaccines as a child, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always supported the freedom to choose what you put in your body.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, his first since he was detained in Melbourne in January, Djokovic addressed speculation about the timing of his positive Covid case in December and discussed his own attitude towards the vaccine.\n\nDjokovic said he hoped vaccination requirements in certain tournaments would change, adding that he was hoping that he \u201ccan play for many more years\u201d.\n\nBut he also confirmed he was willing to forego the chance to become statistically the greatest male tennis player of all time because he felt so strongly. Djokovic\u2019s rival, Rafael Nadal, has won 21 Grand Slam titles \u2013 the most of any competitor.\n\nAsked why, he replied: \u201cBecause the principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else. I\u2019m trying to be in tune with my body as much as I possibly can.\u201d\n\nDjokovic said he had \u201calways been a great student of wellness, wellbeing, health, nutrition,\u201d and that his decision had been partly influenced by the positive impact that factors such as changing his diet and his sleeping patterns, had had on his abilities as an athlete.\n\nHe said he was \u201ckeeping [his] mind open\u201d about the possibility of being vaccinated in the future, \u201cbecause we are all trying to find collectively, a best possible solution to end Covid\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was never against vaccination. I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus.\u201d\n\nDjokovic is, by any measure, a remarkable individual. Raised amidst two wars in the former Yugoslavia, by parents who sold the family gold and negotiated with loan sharks to fund his ambitions, he is fluent in six languages, arguably the greatest player ever to pick up a racket; and \u2013 most pertinently \u2013 a deeply committed libertarian who believes strongly in individual autonomy.\n\nHe has clearly thought deeply about the conflict between individual autonomy and the collective good \u2013 and he feels that, as an elite sportsman, his body is his business \u2013 in both senses of that word. He says he has an open mind, but as things stand, he will not get the jab.",
