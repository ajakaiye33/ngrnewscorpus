          "text": "The Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Dr Salihu Lukman, has asked the party\u2019s hierarchy to perish the thought of negotiating the emergence of a presidential candidate outside the party structure.\n\nHe noted that the speculations that party leaders are pushing this agenda is already doing a lot of damage to the unity among party members.\n\nLukman said this in a statement titled, \u201cAPC and Struggle for New Nigeria\u2019, made public in Abuja, on Sunday.\n\nHe said, \u201cPart of the challenge of excessive politicisation is that it also threatens internal unity of APC members and leaders. For instance, excessive politicisation in the country is influencing the decision of some APC leaders to push negotiation for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 elections outside the structures of the APC.\n\n\u201cThis is now threatening the unity of leaders of APC. Around the whole question of power shift, some leaders of the APC have gone outside the structures of the party to mobilise support for the party to zone its presidential candidate for 2023 to the southern part of the country. In a worrisome way, the loose partnership is being contracted with a section of leaders from other opposition political parties, notably the PDP.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cIt is important that all APC leaders are reminded that the campaign for power shift is about writing or respecting the rules of our party. This should be handled within the structures of the APC.\n\n\u201cIt is belittling for APC leaders who are statutory members of all the relevant structures of the party that are competent to take the final decision on the matter to go outside the structures of the party and forge a partnership with PDP leaders to compel a decision, one way or the other, on the matter. It simply means a loss of confidence in the structures of the party, which in this matter couldn\u2019t have been the case.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important that a strong appeal is made to all APC leaders to develop more confidence to negotiate every matter, including the issue of power shift, within the structures of APC.\u201c",

          "text": "\u2026.says he\u2019ll not be distracted by naysayers, myopic individuals\n\nBy James Ogunnaike\n\nOgun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun at the weekend declared that he would not allow \u2018naysayers\u2019, whose interest are myopic and self-serving distract him in conducting the business of governance of the state.\n\nThe governor equally reiterated that he would continue to discharge the mandate given to him by the people of the state with the fear of God, to ensure a free, fair, and just society that promotes equity, fairness, and justice to all.\n\nAbiodun, who said these while speaking at the \u20182021 Odun Omo Olowu\u2019, held in Abeokuta, the state capital, said the welfare and prosperity of the people of the state irrespective of age, gender, religious or political affiliations or their geographical location, will always be of topmost priority to his administration.\n\nThis, according to Abiodun, will be pursued and achieved through transparent public finance management which provides an atmosphere that guarantees a more prosperous life for the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe believe that people should not pull down the house simply on account of individual or group interest that may not be in alignment with general and overall interest of the state\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are amenable and receptive to robust engagement in order to ensure that the greater majority of our people and state prosper. That is why we have always have an inclusive approach to governance because what concerns one should concern all\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate that we shall continue to uphold all the tenets of good governance by being accountable, transparent, responsive, consensus-oriented, inclusive, participatory, just, fair and equitable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the fact that no government has all the necessary funds it requires for the development of the society and its people. For this reason, we will continue to welcome and appreciate sincere contributions and recommendations that will help develop our state and improve the socio-economic life of our dear people\u201d, the governor stated.\n\nWhile congratulating the Olowu of Owu Kingdom, Oba Olusanya Adegboyega Dosunmu, former President Olusegun Obasanjo who is the Balogun of Owu, Council of Chiefs; and, sons and daughters of Owu Kingdom on the celebration \u2018Odun Omo Olowu\u2019, Abiodun assured that his administration will continue to support all genuine efforts by individuals and groups that are directed at improving the cultural heritage and the lives of the people in general.\n\nThe governor, who described the annual festival as an attestation to the economic, historical and spiritual antecedents of the Owu people, said the festival has projected the rich cultural values and norms of the Owu people and by extension, Ogun State as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt is a festival that helps to remind Owu people of their origin, as an essential component for stimulating communal understanding, love and unity and for augmenting steady progress, peace and development of the larger Community\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis edition is particularly important because of the theme \u2018Prosperity\u2019; this fits very well into Our Building Our Future Together Agenda. The clear vision of our government is to give Ogun State focused and qualitative governance and to create the enabling environment for a public private sector partnership, which we consider fundamental to the creation of an enduring economic development and individual prosperity of the people of Ogun state\u201d.\n\nAbiodun further thanked the Owu people for standing up for truth and for the mandate freely given to him in 2019, stressing that the mandate will not be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cThe Owu people are known for their industrious, courage, valour and candour. We have to thank our Owu brothers and sisters for the support and solidarity given to us on our way to office and since our assumption in office. Yes, the Owu people are reputed never to mince words. We appreciate those who out of genuine desire for the economic growth and their people have offered plausible policy options, encouragement and candid advice to us like the Balogun Owu, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. He has been with us through thick and thin. This is the only way we can make progress and make amends where there are gaps\u201d, the governor said.\n\n\u201cOwu has always made us proud, we shall not let the people down. The recent appointment as African Union High Representative for the Horn of Africa of the Balogun and Alugbua Owu, Chief Obasanjo speaks of his profound experience and widespread network across the continent and the world. That is the essence of being a proud Owu man. It\u2019s congratulations to the whole of Owu, Egbaland and our dear state\u201d, the governor submitted.",

          "title": "Hard times: Nigerians gnashing their teeth",
          "text": "By Cosmas Omegoh, Christy Anyanwu and Agatha Emeadi\n\nBad times are here, hitting hard on a greater number of Nigerians. Many are feeling the pinch in ways difficult to explain; things are changing for everyone fast and quickly; it gets no better.\n\nGoing by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 (NBS) report, in 2020, 40 per cent of Nigerians representing 83 million people live in poverty. The agency also attested that the \u201ccost of food in Nigeria increased by 20.30 per cent in August, 2021 over the same month in the previous year.\u201d\n\nRecall that on June 27, 2021, it emerged that if \u201cthe World Bank\u2019s income poverty threshold of $3.20 per day is used, Nigeria\u2019s poverty rate is 71 per cent.\n\nSadly, recent astronomical increases in prices of goods and services in the country, coupled with the falling value of the naira, are making a lot more people poorer than they used to be. Poverty level in the country itself is being pushed to unprecedented new heights and the indicators are there for everyone to see.\n\nFrom Warri to Wurno and Oyo to Uyo, for instance, poverty, want stares everyone in the face. The story is the same, a greater majority are getting increasingly poorer, whacked daily by the hunger that is prowling all over on all fours. For a fact, many do not have food to eat to stay alive. Much worse, they don\u2019t have money to spend and to meet their daily average needs; even the value of the naira they have is growing worthless as the hours roll by, raising fears that in days ahead, a N1,000 bill may only be able to fetch a roll of tissue paper.\n\nAs it were, prices of goods \u2013 both imported and local \u2013 are shooting through the roof, hitting dizzying heights in a hard-to-understand manner. Things continue to head South amid daunting health challenges brought by COVID-19 pandemic, cholera outbreaks, malaria fever menace, doctors\u2019 strike, among others. Added to this myriad is decreasing access to healthcare, drugs and education amid schools closing down in some areas. Access to potable water supply even in some urbane urban areas still remains herculean. Then entered the big monster: insecurity which has seen armed gangs regularly on the rampage everywhere. Bandits and kidnappers at every turn, are camped, busy entrenching their act as a thriving trade, taking people for ransom, and driving away farmers from their fields, straight into Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. Misery is being spread everywhere like a wet blanket. And the result out there is that people\u2019s standard of living is dipping every day.\n\nThe aggregate result of the current spate of challenges is poverty; many more folks are increasingly getting mired in it. The reality check reveals that helplessness and hopelessness are on the rise. People are suffering, languishing unbelievably, indescribably. That is the undeniable truth at the moment which many cannot tell how it all began.\n\nOur correspondents gathered that the dwindling value of the naira is at the heart of the country\u2019s deepening woes. That alone is massively affecting the prices of everything: food, goods \u2013 both imported and local as well as services. The indicators are showing that this swing of the naira is hugely affecting lives and livelihoods.\n\nHow naira value is falling\n\nNot long ago, only few Nigerians gave a damn about the naira and what weighed on the scale, compared to other foreign currencies. But the people are now asking questions because the currency\u2019s dwindling fortune is altering their lives.\n\nRight now, it was learnt, the value of the naira is on every lip. Market women even know how far and fast the naira is failing \u2013 how its sustained plunge into the plains is dictating the price of everything money can buy.\n\nAbout 2015, it would be recalled, the naira exchanged for about N187 to the US dollar. Then dramatically its fortune changed, downward, it went without any let up. Nowadays, it is maintaining daily exchange regimes. Having exceeded the N550 mark to the US dollar, there is fear and anxiety that it might hit N1,000 threshold to the dollar before Christmas, a very bad omen that won\u2019t serve anyone any good.\n\nAt Shita, in Surulere, Lagos, where foreign currencies dealers operate, one Ibrahim told our correspondent that a dollar exchanged for N560; he resold the same dollar for N570, while he bought the UK pound for N780. The Euro he said exchanged for N650.\n\nAccording to Ibrahim, \u201clast year, things were not as bad. A dollar exchanged between N353 and N405.\u201d\n\nHis lamented that \u201cthe times are hard for our business. Things are not good at all; we are also suffering like every other Nigerian.\u201d\n\nAccording to a financial expert, Ben Kpaduwa, the fall of the value of the naira signifies a drastic reduction in the purchasing power of the people, a pointer to how poor the people are getting. \u201cThis fuels inflation. And what that means is that goods earlier purchased at N1 will no longer sell at N1.\n\n\u201cIf you bought a unit of Lexus jeep, for instance, for N5 million before, you might now buy the same car for as high as N6 million; that means the purchasing power of the prospective buyer has been greatly reduced,\u201d he said.\n\nKpaduwa is sad about this turn of events \u201cbecause since the purchasing power of the citizenry has been greatly reduced, many families can no longer meet their average needs because inflation is on the rise. The price regimes of every article in the market is no longer stable; they keep changing by the day all because the exchange rate priority keeps changing. This keeps weakening the local currency.\u201d\n\nHow inflation affects food\n\nIt was a certain TY Bello, a female artist, who sang the song \u201cThe land is green.\u201d But right now, the land is no longer green anywhere in Nigeria, but red because the people are hungry.\n\nTruly, there is hunger and danger in the land; food prices soaring away far beyond the reach of the people; they are escalating dangerously.\n\nSunday Sun investigations at major markets in Lagos revealed that if care is not taken, the country might be returning to the dark ages when uncertainty ruled; and food was scarce.\n\nDuring an encounter, Chuks Ibezimako, a major food stuff dealer, said: \u201cThere is no brand of beans that is cheap in the market now. Various species earlier considered bad have become king of the market.\n\n\u201cThe brown Olotu and Oloyin beans which come in 75 Derica measure per full jute bag now cost as much as N100, 000. That is the reason a Derica cup now costs N800 against N400 it sold early this year.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that a bag of foreign rice now costs N29,000; the same bag sold for N21,000 between January and March this year. He noted that a Derica measure of foreign rice now costs N600 against N400 previously.\n\nTo underline the gravity of the challenge, a groundnut oil seller, Mrs Chinwe Emmanuel in a chat, warned our correspondent to \u201cbuy your Christmas food now, tomorrow, you will buy it at double the price.\u201d\n\nShe said that the price of 75cl container of frying oil that previously sold for N450, now costs N850 while the 1.5litres of the same oil now sells for N1, 600\n\nNow what about eggs? A crate of 30 which earlier sold for N850, now costs N1,450; at the retail kiosk, one egg now sells for N70.\n\nWhen our correspondent visited Mushin Market in Lagos, similar astronomical increases in other food stuff prices were also noticed. Various cartons of fish which sold between N12,000 and N14,000 earlier in the year, now cost above N29,000 per carton.\n\nAccording to Sukurat Hassan, frozen chicken is also experiencing sharp increases in price. Her colleague, Hajia Hanatu, testified that chicken products which previously sold for N18,000 per carton, recently saw a sharp increase in price. It now sells for N28,000. That brings a kilo of chicken to N2,000 while a kilo of turkey sells for N2,300.00.\n\nAt Ikotun Market also in Lagos, the average basket of fresh tomatoes or pepper which earlier sold for N25,000, now sells for N32,000.\n\nInvestigations by Sunday Sun also revealed that master bakers, bread sellers and consumers are also taking the heat. Right now, a big loaf of bread that can serve a family of four which sold for N450 earlier now costs N750.\n\nA bread seller, Osai Okhia said: \u201cLong before now, bread used to be food for the common man. But now, it is longer so.\n\n\u201cThe loaves of bread we sold for N250 a few months ago now sell for N350. Those we sold for N450 then now cost N600.\n\n\u201cNow, speculations that master bakers will soon increase their prices, citing high cost of production is not good at all. I don\u2019t know where this country is headed.\u201d\n\nThat aside, sachet water producers some months ago, increased the price of their products from N500 for five bags to N750 for the same quantity. Before then, they had reduced the number of sachets per bag from 25 to 20. Consequently, the retail price of a sachet of water now is N20 up from N10.\n\nImported goods\u2019 prices also rising\n\nAs it stands, every Nigerian \u2013 the poor and the rich alike \u2013 is facing realistic arbitrary increases in prices of imported and locally-manufactured goods.\n\n\u201cSee this rechargeable touch made in China,\u201d a roadside trader, Mama Iyabo, explained to our correspondent in Oshodi, Lagos, \u201cin April this year, we sold it for N400. But right now, the price has more than doubled itself. We are selling a unit for N850. The same for every other stuff here.\u201d\n\nDrive home that sentiment of looming uncertainty, she added: \u201cI will advise you to buy more than one for yourself and keep in case you care.\n\n\u201cBy the time you come back here next time, who knows the price would have risen to N1,000.\u201d\n\nAt Yaba Market also in Lagos, the story was not different. A curtain seller identified as Emeka Ijeoma described price instability as the bane of every trader right now.\n\n\u201cThis very material,\u201d he said, pointing at a particular one, \u201cmonths ago we sold a yard for N800. But now, a yard goes for N1,600.\u201d\n\nNext, he said: \u201cWhen we sell off our stock, we are not sure of getting them at the same prices when we return to buy more.\u201d\n\nAnother trader, Martin Chiagozie, who deals in imported used cars in Apapa, Lagos, echoed similar sentiments, recalling that \u201cprices of cars have been on a steady rise because the naira is on a free fall.\n\n\u201cCars we hitherto sold for N2.5 million now go for N3.5 million. Funny enough, most people no longer have the money to buy cars unlike before. What that tells us is that there is a big problem.\n\n\u201cIt is horrible for a businessman to sell off his stock and won\u2019t be able to restock. It signals downfall.\u201d\n\nHe was afraid things might get worse as \u201cwhat we are hearing now that Customs will henceforth impose N1.5 million on every container arriving in the country is bad news. It is a calculated attempt to further impose hardship on the people. Who pays for that levy if not the final consumer?\u201d\n\nNow, those who think the dwindling value of the naira does not affect locally- manufactured goods are mistaken.\n\nA building-block moulder in Isheri, a part of Lagos, who did not want his name mentioned drew our correspondent\u2019s attention to the unstable prices of cement and other building materials in the market.\n\n\u201cEverything building materials is now very expensive. Look at the cost of cement, for instance.\n\n\u201cA bag of (a certain popular brand) now sells for between N3,700 and N4,500. Sometimes we don\u2019t even see it to buy.\n\n\u201cHitherto, we bought a 30-ton truck load of sharp sand for our business for N70,000. Now it goes for as high as N90,000.\n\n\u201cThat too has affected the price, and quality of building blocks in the market. For instance, a 9\u201d block right now costs N270 per a unit in some places. That alone is stopping people from building houses.\n\n\u201cAlready, some people have begun cutting corners by moulding 50 blocks per bag of cement. As for the quality of houses built with such material, your guess is as good as mine.\u201d\n\nThe cost of school uniforms is not exempted from the burden most families now have to bear.\n\nIt was gathered that not long ago, a yard of check material that makes a shirt for a student costs N400. But now, it sells at N700, the same for the trouser and skirt materials for both boys and girls.\n\nBad times too for service industry\n\nOther sub-sectors in the services industry have continued to experience increases in prices as inflation worsens.\n\nInvestigations at Mazamaza bus terminal in Lagos revealed that the transport sector had witnessed marginal increases in fares, a development an operator described as \u201cborne out of caution.\u201d\n\nHe informed our correspondent that his company still charges N5,000 for a bus ride from Lagos to the East, stating that the price had remained stable for a while.\n\n\u201cWe are careful not to drive away our customers. Of course, there are other competitors waiting to snatch them. Besides, this is off season,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother operator, Okechukwu, disclosed that a ride on Toyota Siena car depending on the destination in the East costs between N7,500 and N8,500. He also revealed that operators of 14-passenger sprinter buses charge N5,500 depending on the company and destination in the East.\n\nBut a fruit seller, Mama Bose, argued that high transport fares affect prices of food stuff mostly sourced from the North, Edo and other states in the Southwest.\n\n\u201cFruits, tomatoes and other food items like yam are brought mostly from the North.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of fares reflect on the items we sell,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, a load carrier, Mr Adam, who specialises in hauling household items for relocating families, maintained that because of the rising cost of maintenance of vehicles, he now charges between N25,000 and N35,000 for loads in a three-bedroom apartment depending on the destination within Lagos.\n\nWhile the marginal increment might appear a reprieve, there is the fear that when the Federal Government eventually removes the subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) someday, the prices of transportation will rise astronomically and worsen the already bad situation.\n\nTraders, artisans lament\n\nWhile bemoaning the situation, Mr Jimoh Bamishe, a motor mechanic maintained that things are no longer the same in the country.\n\nHe said that due to the high cost of maintenance of vehicles, many people had parked their cars at home and now have rest of mind.\n\n\u201cThey prefer to go on BRT or Uber instead of maintaining their cars. Once you tell them the cost of repairs, they tell you they would do that when it is convenient. Therefore, many of our customers are no longer coming forward.\n\n\u201cIt is 9:00a.m, yet I\u2019m still at home. Before now, I used to leave home at 7:00a.m because there were lots of works to do at the workshop,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lamented that \u201cmotor parts are becoming very expensive everyday; Toyota Corolla pedal that sold for N10,000 last year, now goes for 18,000.\n\n\u201cI bought a Toyota Camry door this week for N30,000; it hitherto sold for N22,000.\u201d\n\nMayokun Ibikunle, a fashion designer also in Lagos complained bitterly that her customers no longer come to pick their wears after she had finished sewing them.\n\n\u201cSince COVID-19, we have been experiencing low patronage. People don\u2019t buy or sew clothes like before. The ones that brought their materials for sewing have practically abandoned them with us. You call them severally they don\u2019t even bother to take their calls.\u201d\n\nJoining in the lamentations, Joyce, who owns a boutique in Balogun market, Lagos, said now they simply go to market to mark time.\n\nShe said her customers are no longer coming; their attention is focused more on their feeding.\n\n\u201cI have done sales slash since last month, yet customers are not coming forth.\u201d\n\nAlso Mrs Ope Tejuoso who runs Opindos Cakes and Pastries lamented the high cost of baking materials, adding: \u201cFor those preparing to wed, we now discuss the imperative of reducing the cake to accommodate their finances.\u201d\n\nCooking gas prices rise arbitrarily\n\nCooking gas has also witnessed the mother of all increases.\n\nKinsley Maduka, a dealer in cooking gas in Surulere, Lagos, said that 12.5 kg cylinder of gas now goes for N7,200. As at last month, he said the price remained at N5,000. Last year while COVID-19 raged badly, it sold for N3,000. The price, he said, rises every day.\n\n\u201cAs of today, September 30, 2021, 12.5kg cylinder of gas costs N7,200; I don\u2019t know about tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThese prices vary depending on location; some of my colleagues on the Island are selling at higher prices.\u201d\n\nOur correspondent observed that as the cost of gas rises, the poor cannot even afford the cost of kerosene as alternative source of cooking energy.\n\nA litre, it was learnt, now costs N350 at the filling stations and much higher elsewhere, way above the price of PMS.\n\nDescribed the rapidly escalating prices of everything in the market and the poverty in tow as \u201ctiring,\u201d Ibikunle captured the fear of the people, saying: \u201cWe no longer know what is happening in this country nowadays. \u201cPeople are now only looking for money for food \u2013 just food and nothing else.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "What Buhari should do to win the insurgency war \u2013 Senator Ndume",
          "text": "By Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenator Mohammed Ali Ndume heads the Senate Committee on Army. He is a former leader of the Senate and represents Borno South in the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nIn this interview with our correspondent, he spoke on military operations and other security issues in the country, suggesting what President Muhammadu Buhari should do that can help him to win the Boko Haram war.\n\nWhat is your take attack on military formations?\n\nThey now even have the audacity to attack the military. In the Northeast, Boko Haram terrorists took the fight to military formations. They attacked barracks and dislodged military formations. The military had to withdraw from those areas. As I speak, the Bama Barracks has not been rebuilt. The situation in Mongonu is still the same. There are so many formations that were dislodged. There are countless times that the military formations have been attacked. In the Southeast too, many police formations were attacked and burnt down. In some cases, their arms were taken away. Remember a military general who was killed in Kogi. There are several cases. But this is the first time the bandits will have the audacity to take the fight to a military training institution, that was very daring. I think this is the time for the Armed Forces to act. I must admit that they\u2019re overwhelmed. They\u2019re facing so many challenges. In every geopolitical zone, there are security challenges. The only difference is the magnitude. Some are higher than others. This is the peak of it and these bandits want to send a message that they\u2019re still there. What I\u2019m expecting is that the military will go after these bandits. If someone challenges you and they want to embarrass you, it will be time for you to respond immediately.\n\nThere are claims that insiders are giving information to these bandits\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) There will always be insiders. The only thing is that, if they can\u2019t go outside, you keep them inside. You\u2019ve to take measures. It is the responsibility of the military to expose them.\n\nPeople are alleging that some of the sponsors of these bandits and criminals are in government. What do you think the government should do?\n\nLet those alleging come out. The institutions are there. They\u2019re ready to listen. If you\u2019ve intelligence, why not bring it out? I can\u2019t dispute the fact that insiders will be there. I was a victim of being called a sponsor of Boko Haram. Once you\u2019re innocent, in a matter of time, your innocence will be proven. I was convicted by the press as a sponsor of Boko Haram. As at the time they\u2019re accusing me of being a sponsor of Boko Haram, the government was already reaching out to their leaders. Jonathan even went to Tchad to talk to the late president about one character who was a Boko Haram leader. They spent a lot of money. If you\u2019ve information, share it with the right people.\n\nWhat should the president do?\n\nThe only thing the president isn\u2019t doing is that, he is not talking to Nigerians. He should be talking more. You can see what is happening in other countries, their presidents are talking to the people. We can\u2019t rely on Garba Shehu or Femi Adesina. The president should create a situation room where everyday, he can brief or maybe weekly. That will encourage Nigerians. The president should take charge. From the briefings he gets, he can share some with Nigerians. That may not change the situation, but it will help. We are not asking him to lead the fight, but he needs to do more.\n\nWhat is your take on the reintegration of repentant Boko Haram fighters into the society?\n\nWhat people are saying isn\u2019t true. They\u2019re taking them in and the process is long. Each and everyone who has surrendered is being interrogated. Once someone surrenders in a war situation, you don\u2019t go ahead and shot the person again. You take him and he becomes a prisoner of war. You now have to prosecute him. But you can\u2019t do that without interrogation or some evidence. It is not true that they\u2019re taking them in and allowing them to go freely. In my village, hundreds are surrendering. A facility somewhere is available. Boko Haram fighters are being kept there. There are judges assigned. Some of these people have been tried and sentenced already. Some of them who were innocent and forcefully conscripted, are set free. What we are saying is that, those of us directly affected should be involved. We know some of them. Those from my area, I may know their level of involvement. We can explain to them and give them information that can help. It is only through investigation and interrogation that we can get the right results. There are many of them who are victims. In my village, so many innocent people were captured. Terrorists have been using them as human shields. Our people know them. When they come out, you can\u2019t just tag them terrorists. The government is coming out with a programme that will strengthen this process. The media should be on the positive side. The government should pursue the Boko Haram war and bring it to an end. They should start thinking of resettlement and other issues surrounding those displaced. We have thousands of IDPs across Nigeria.\n\nHave they recruited any of those surrendered into the military?\n\nDo you recruit people like that? It is not possible to do that. The best they can get from repentant Boko Haram fighters is information. The army can\u2019t even do that. There is a process. It is not also not true that commanders of Boko Haram are being resettled. They can\u2019t grant a blanket amnesty to these terrorists. There is a process. Not even the president can do that.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

Ibrahim Babangida (rtd); a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Aliyu Gusau, and some other elders.\n\nOne of the northern elders privy to the intrigues told THISDAY last night that zoning the party\u2019s chairmanship position to the North-central would ensure the emergence of the vice-presidential candidate from the North-west.\n\n\u201cNorthern elders in the party want the chairmanship zoned to the North-central to enable a vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate come from the North-west, given the power bloc.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, some are looking at David Mark and or Ibrahim Shema. Sule Lamido is also being considered. But most of the elders are saying that if Shema or Lamido runs, it could stop the North-west from bringing the vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate because the southern governors in the party are determined that the presidency should go to the South, in line with the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and they are looking at one of their own as a candidate, despite all the blackmail,\u201d the source explained.\n\nHowever, the source added that the loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki are moving to use the court to return Secondus.\n\n\u201cIf they return Secondus, they can take control of the party, and retain the presidency in the North in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nNEC Meets Thursday to Consider Zoning Report\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has summoned an emergency NEC meeting for Thursday, October 7, at its national headquarters, to consider the report of the zoning of the offices of the NWC.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Umaru Ibrahim Tsauri, all members of the National Executive Committee are invited to the emergency NEC meeting.\n\nZamfara Deputy Governor Clarifies Zoning of Offices\n\nIn a related development, the Secretary of the NCZC and Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mr. Mahdi Aliyu Gusau has clarified the zoning of offices in the party.\n\nIn an interview with journalists in Abuja on Friday, he debunked speculations that the presidential ambition of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State; Atiku; Saraki, and a former Governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, had been foreclosed.\n\n\u201cAfter our meeting, some mischief makers started spreading false stories that our committee has zoned the Presidency to the South.\n\n\u201cThis is not true. Our committee was mandated to decide on those that would seek party positions. This does not include those who want to seek the positions of president, vice president, governors, and the like.\n\n\u201cAb initio, it was made clear that our committee does not have the mandate on any other matter regarding zoning or otherwise, except that which regards the party at the federal level.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nNiger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, has raised the alarm that bandits and terrorists have now formed an alliance to wreak havoc on innocent people in communities in the state.\n\nThis is coming as suspected bandits operating in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto State have allegedly written a letter to a monarch in Burkusuma demanding ransom to secure the release of 20 persons kidnapped from two communities in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSpeaking in Minna at the weekend after commiserating with injured soldiers at the IBB Specialist hospital, Bello who just returned from an official trip to Turkey also confirmed the killing of two soldiers and the injuring of 12 others in the last attack by bandits on Kagara town, headquarters of the Rafi Local Government Area of the state.\n\nAfter commiserating with injured soldiers at the IBB Specialist Hospital in Minna, the governor said more soldiers were injured in the Kagara incident.\n\nWhile revealing that some of the injured soldiers had been moved to Kaduna for treatment, he added that the other 12 were hospitalised at the IBB Specialist Hospital in Minna.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have an alliance with terrorists considering their increasing number and the way they plan and carry out their attacks,\u201d Bello said.\n\nBello said the bandits however suffered losses during the operation but could not say how many of them were neutralised or injured.\n\nHe lamented that: \u201cWe have lost quite a number of them (security operatives) since the operation started and we don\u2019t intend to lose more. What we are calling for is a safe environment and for everyone to support the ongoing operation by the security agents\u201d.\n\nHe accused some communities of harbouring bandits because of fear that they could be attacked, warning that \u201cvery soon we will tag those communities as same elements as bandits. If you are harbouring any bandits and you know, you are one even if you don\u2019t carry a gun because you are risking the lives of our security agents\u201d.\n\nIn a related development, suspected bandits operating in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto State have allegedly written a letter to a monarch in Burkusuma demanding ransom to secure the release of 20 persons kidnapped from two communities in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe letter was allegedly written in the Hausa language by one of the victims kidnapped by the bandits and addressed to Sarkin Rafin Burkusuma, the district head of the area.\n\nThe bandits informed the monarch that the victims kidnapped from Gatawa and Burkusuma are all in good health.\n\nThey thereafter demanded the sum of N20 million to be paid for the release of their victims.\n\nThe kidnapped victims, whose names were all written in the letter, consist of nine males, eight females and two children.\n\nOne of the victims was released to deliver the letter to Gatawa through the Sarkin Rakin Burkusuma.\n\nChannels TV reported that the bandits have resorted to sending letters to families of kidnapped victims since the shutdown of telecommunication services in the area.\n\nAn effort by the TV station to reach the Sokoto State Police Command for confirmation was unsuccessful as the mobile line of the Police Public Relations Officer, Sanusi Abubakar, could not be reached at the time of filing this report.\n\nIn another development, the Zamfara State Police Command has said it has arrested one of the notorious commanders of bandits, Bello Ruga.\n\nThe Commissioner for Police in Zamfara, Ayuba Elkana, who disclosed this to reporters, said Bello, also known as Bello Dan Malankara, was apprehended at a bandits\u2019 camp in Gummi Local Government Area of the state.\n\n\u201cOn October 1, 2021, police tactical operatives on anti-banditry operations around Gummi axis acted on intelligence report and stormed Gidan Bita, Malankare, and Kagara forest in search of one notorious bandit known as Bello Rugga,\u201d he said during a briefing on Friday at the Police Headquarters in Gusau.\n\n\u201cThe bandit who happens to be one of the Turji\u2019s commanders was the one in charge of Gummi, Gidan Bita, Malankare, and Kagara forest in Gummi LGA.\n\n\u201cHe has been commanding a series of attacks and kidnaps in Gummi that led to the unwarranted killing of innocent people, and the kidnapping of many persons where ransoms were paid. The suspect who has many bandits under him also is in possession of AK-47 rifles.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Elkana announced that all vehicles with unauthorised tinted glass should be immediately removed.\n\nHe also directed the police to arrest and prosecute owners of vehicles without plate numbers on all roads in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 OPEC mulls oil quota hike as supply tightens\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAs the world moves to tackle climate change, the International Oil Companies (IOCs), which insist on ramping up production of fossil fuels in Africa may face the risk of regulatory action from the United States, the country\u2019s Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, Jonathan Pershing, has said.\n\nIf the US makes good its threat, it will be a major blow to Nigeria, Angola, Congo and other oil-producing countries in Africa, which have intensified efforts to attract foreign investors to fund major hydrocarbons projects on the continent.\n\nThis is coming as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, are considering going beyond the existing deal to boost production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets tomorrow (Monday).\n\nIn August, President Muhammadu Buhari finally signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to spur competition in the sector as well as attract foreign investments.\n\nBut with the position of the US, many of the expected funding for Nigeria\u2019s fossil fuels may be stranded since oil companies would be circumspect about putting their dollars in the upcoming projects.\n\nWestern fossil fuel companies planning to develop new projects in Africa would then need to consider the significant risk of regulatory action vis-\u00e0-vis the returns on investment in Africa.\n\nSpeaking from South Africa, the US envoy urged western investors to consider whether fossil fuels were a good commercial opportunity anymore in Africa or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of regulatory \u2026 and financial activities, and I believe that\u2019s getting more and more explicit. If you are a company looking to invest in oil and gas, you have to ask yourself\u2026\u2018am I going to be left with a stranded asset?\u2019 I would not bet very strongly on a fossil fuel future,\u201d he said.\n\nPershing, who was speaking at a virtual media briefing, after being asked about the current rush by western oil and gas companies to develop deposits in Africa, noted that even China had committed to stop building overseas coal plants.\n\nAfrica accounts for just 3.8 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project, but Pershing noted it was the fastest-growing continent.\n\nIt could, he said: \u201cleapfrog\u201d older carbon-based technologies and embrace renewables, just as it skipped wired telecoms in many places and went straight for wireless.\n\n\u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t need to move in the direction of the West\u2019s high-carbon intensity. It can move directly beyond that,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments came despite the United States itself being a major producer and exporter of oil and gas, with recent growth driven by output from shale fields, a Reuters report said.\n\nThe US envoy is visiting several African countries as part of efforts to raise global climate ambition ahead of the United Nations COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland next month.\n\nAfrican nations are seeking financial assistance from the West to switch to renewables.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa, the continent\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter and the world\u2019s 12th largest, owing to its reliance on coal-fired power, told the envoy that it needed major support for its energy transition.\n\nIn the new PIA, Nigeria is devoting as much as 30 per cent of the proposed Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit gas, to crude exploration in the frontier basins.\n\nSpeaking recently on why Nigeria continued to focus on a seemingly irrelevant resource, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva as well as the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, had noted that the idea was to get as much oil as possible from beneath the ground before it becomes useless.\n\nMost of the big IOCs like Royal Dutch Shell, Mobil, Chevron which operates in the United States also have major investments in Nigeria and could withdraw funding for Nigerian hydrocarbons if threatened in that country.\n\nOPEC Mulls Oil Quota Hike as Supply Tightens\n\nMeanwhile, OPEC and its allies OPEC+ are considering going beyond its existing deal to boost production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets tomorrow (Monday).\n\nAt a time oil prices are near a three-year high and consumers are pressing for more supply, OPEC and its allies led by Russia will seek to review the output policy of the alliance.\n\nIn July, the group agreed to boost output by 400,000 bpd a month to phase out 5.8 million bpd in cuts, which were embarked upon in April last year after prices collapsed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nReuters quoted four OPEC+ sources as saying that producers were considering adding more than that deal envisaged, with one source suggesting that an increase of 800,000 bpd for one month was possible, with zero the next month.\n\nThe nearest month any increase could occur is November since the producers\u2019 last meeting decided the October volumes.\n\n\u201cWe cannot exclude any option,\u201d one of the OPEC+ sources said.\n\nThe idea that the oil market might need more oil than the existing deal planned for was \u201cone of the possible scenarios,\u201d said another source.\n\nAlthough there had been insinuations that the cartel will most likely stick to the existing plan, it was not immediately clear what prompted the change of tone, but it followed a meeting of the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee (JTC) which reviewed the market outlook and reduced the size of an expected supply surplus in 2022.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brent oil rose to a three-year high above $80 a barrel, boosted by unplanned outages in the United States and a strong recovery in global economic activity and energy demand as many countries emerge from the pandemic, but fell on Friday to $79.28.\n\nRising oil, gas, coal, and power prices are feeding inflationary pressures worldwide and slowing the recovery.\n\nEnergy ministers from OPEC members Iraq, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates said in recent weeks the group saw no need to take extraordinary measures to change the existing agreement, but that could be altered tomorrow with the latest change of tone.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "As the 2023 polls draw near, the wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has perfected a strategy to impose her younger brother, Mr Mohammed Halilu Modi, as the next Governor of Adamawa State, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the First Lady's machination which has torn the Adamawa chapter of the All Progressives Congress apart enjoys the full support of the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Malam Mai Mala Buni, who is also the Yobe State Governor.\n\nAisha Buhari\n\nThe former Vice-Chairman, North-East Zone, Comrade Mustapha Salihu, and the Financial Secretary of the party, Mr Saidu Naira, were identified as the foot soldiers manipulating the congresses in Adamawa State to facilitate the emergence of the First Lady's brother as the governorship candidate of the APC in the state.\n\nA source noted that the First Lady's brother has not held any known public office, neither has he worked as a civil servant his entire life.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that as part of the preparation to ensure that her brother was tutored for the job of a governor, Aisha recently sent Modi to the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, near Jos, Plateau State, to study, while the President's wife perfected the taking over of the APC's structure in Adamawa.\n\nThere are concerns that the first lady's desperation to assume full control of the party's structure in Adamawa State is not going down well with aggrieved stakeholders.\n\nAt the just-concluded Local Government Congresses of the APC in the state, the First Lady used her influence to intimidate perceived political opponents of her brother such as Senator Dahiru Binani, Senator Mohammed Jibrilla Bindow (former Governor of the state) and Senator Ishaku Abbo (who represents Adamawa North Senatorial zone) in the Senate to hijack the party structure in the state.\n\nA source conversant with the development, explained further, \u201cThere is a serious problem brewing at the Adamawa APC, which if not resolved quickly, may cost the party the seat of governor again like it did in 2019.\n\n\"Recall that in 2019, the party lost the governorship contest to the incumbent and member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Ahmadu Fintiri, over this same power tussle between Mrs Buhari, Bindow, Binani and other opponents in the quest to make her brother become the governor.\n\n\"In the same vein, security chiefs in the state were threatened with sack if they did not cooperate by facilitating Modi\u2019s aspiration.\"\n\nIt was also revealed that the first casualty of the threat was the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Aliyu Adamu Alhaji, who was said to have insisted on fully supervising the congresses in Yola South.\n\nAs a result, the First Lady's candidate lost to Senator Binani\u2019s candidate.\n\nAisha, who was enraged over the turn of events, was said to have immediately seen to the transfer of the CP out of Adamawa.\n\nHe had since been replaced by a new CP, Mr Mohammed Ahmed Barde.\n\n\"As things stand today, all the heads of federal agencies in the state, whose line of duty relate to supervising party congresses, are living in fear of the unknown, should they attempt to work against the interest of the First Lady's brother\", another party official said.\n\nSources further revealed that most of the names from the ward and local government congresses sent to the national secretariat of the APC were altered by the quartet in Abuja, which led to aeries of litigations challenging the alterations.\n\nAisha, who is not hiding the fact of her deep involvement in the ongoing manipulation, was quoted to have said, \u201cI will not repeat the mistake of 2019 where we allowed Governor Bindow to have total control of the party to the disadvantage of many of us.\u201d\n\nSources said Aisha had vowed that she could not afford to leave office with her husband in 2023 without any of her family members taking over Adamawa State in a bid to sustain their political relevance in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cExcept something is done urgently to amicably resolve the grievances from the ward and local government congresses, especially that the state congress is close by, many stakeholders may defect to the PDP.\n\n\"If this is allowed to happen, it is the APC that will be the big loser again in 2023, just like it happened in 2019. The way they are going, they can only help the PDP and governor Fintiri to win re-election in 2023\", a top party official stated.\n\nIncidentally, the current manipulation in Adamawa is going on at a time the general feeling in the state is that the governorship seat should rotate to another zone outside Adamawa Central in order to engender fairness and give a sense of belonging to all the geopolitical zones in the former Gongola State.\n\nAlthough the First Lady is rooting that the Central Zone has yet to produce a governor and believes it is the turn of the zone to do so in 2023, APC stakeholders are opposing her position on the grounds that her zone produced the post of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation since 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the fact that Aisha being the First Lady of the Federation and coming from the Central Zone as well, the zone has had its own fair share of the power equation and should hands off the governorship seat for another zone in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nSimilarly, the Northern Senatorial Zone had produced a governor for a record six times and the feeling is that the zone had benefitted adequately.\n\n\"Such fairness can never be achieved if the congresses are manipulated against the wishes and aspirations of the people\", another party source added.\n\n\"Now, during the local government congresses, this was what happened.

Her case is not the first of its kind but this one caused widespread rage among the students. Most times, patients are not being taken care of,\u201d the student said.\n\n\u201cOther times, you are given substandard drugs. We can no longer tolerate it. What caused her death was that she was given drugs we feel weren\u2019t correct. Her friend recommended that she be admitted but she wasn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was sad when we heard she had passed away. She had an ulcer and some other issues, not that she died at the health centre. We\u2019ve been protesting since Thursday night, into Friday. We\u2019ll be having a candle night procession.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Abiodun Olarewaju, OAU\u2019s spokesperson, did not respond to the allegations of negligence.\n\nBut in a statement, the PRO instead appealed to the students to remain calm while commiserating with the family of the deceased.\n\n\u201cThe management of OAU, Ile Ife, regrets to announce the death of one of our students, Adesina Omowumi Aisat, a 24-year-old, female student of the department of foreign languages,\u201d the statement read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe student reported to the Health Centre on Tuesday, 28th September 2021 with signs and symptoms of a severe infection. She was promptly treated with some drugs prescribed and asked to report back as an outpatient.\n\n\u201cAdesina reported back to the health centre on the morning of Thursday, September 30, 2021. Upon examination, she was referred to the Seventh Day Adventist Hospital for further management where she regrettably died.\n\n\u201cThe management sympathises with the parents, friends, colleagues and the entire students of the university.\n\n\u201cThe management will like to appeal to all students of the university to remain calm and kindly refrain from any act that can jeopardise the peace on campus and truncate the ongoing rain semester examinations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee photos of the protesting students below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nAccording to the president, a committee constituted to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria had successfully addressed a number of key issues, including \u201cnational security and cohesion; registration of physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee, which was set up in July, is led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who revealed in August that the ban would be lifted in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will soon be lifted as we are getting close to reaching full agreement,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe have agreed on some areas, hopefully in the next few days or weeks, we will conclude.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.

Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling. Our passion, commitment, and experiences will stand us in good stead as we embark on this journey.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "The website of Nigeria\u2019s official digital currency, eNaira, went live on Monday, four days before its planned launch on October 1, as disclosed by Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nDeveloped by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the apex bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria.\n\nA welcome note on the website describes the eNaira as a \u201cCentral Bank of Nigeria-issued digital currency that provides a unique form of money denominated in Naira.\u201d\n\nThe website is a central repository where users can find comprehensive information about the official digital currency, but it offers much more than just details of the eNaira. TechCabal reviewed the website and here are at least five other things Nigerians can do on the platform.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n1. Download the eNaira application\n\nThe eNaira app (termed \u201cSpeed\u201d) can be downloaded from either the Google PlayStore, Apple App Store, or by scanning a QR code on the website. The app is expected to be available for download from October 1, 2021, and will serve as the official wallet for smartphone users.\n\n2. Manage your wallet\n\neNaira users will be able to fund and manage funds in their wallets on the website once the digital currency is officially rolled out on October 1. According to information on the platform, the wallet offers a \u201cgreat way of making purchases with retailers on-site, transferring or sending money\u201d. The e-wallet can also be linked to bank accounts and used for pay-as-you-go services.\n\n3. Join the eNaira community\n\nThe community is a social hub where, according to a note on the website, eNaira users across the globe can connect with one another, share their experiences using the digital currency, offer as well as request help.\n\nThere are four community rooms, each designed to host conversations about eNaira regulations, merchants, wallet, and registrations. Nigerians who are interested in joining the community can sign up using their email addresses.\n\n4. Stay up to date with news on CBDCs\n\nThe news hub on the website curates content relating to the eNaira and other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) across the world for users to stay updated with relevant developments on official digital currencies.\n\n\u201cCBDCs are being developed all over the world for differing national objectives. Being an eNaira user naturally transports you to the world of CBDCs and this space is your guide to that world,\u201d a note on the website reads.\n\n5. Read and share eNaira insights and experiences\n\nNigerians who choose to put their experiences with the eNaira in writing or want to share important insights can reach out to the authorities and have their feedback published on the Insights/Users Speak page of the website.\n\nThe eNaira website is loaded with very important information and instructions as well as answers to potential questions in the FAQ section. It\u2019s generally a good foundation to build on, ahead of the official launch of the digital currency on Friday.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "#TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Nigerians have been promised the lifting of the four-month-long Twitter ban. After the last promise in August of \u2018a few days\u2019 given by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, President Muhammadu Buhari, in his Independence Day speech, today mentioned that the ban would be lifted conditionally based on the fulfilment of some obligations by the social media giant.\n\nRecall that in early June 2021, the Nigerian government indefinitely suspended Twitter after the platform removed a Tweet by the president for violating its rules. An infringement on citizens\u2019 right to free speech, this move has drawn reactions from human rights advocacy groups across the country.\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), for instance, filed an appeal at the ECOWAS court in Abuja asking the court to order the president to lift the ban. However, recent developments show that the case has been adjourned for final judgement on January 20, 2022.\n\nSo far, the government claims that the global tech company is only partially cooperating and hasn\u2019t fully met its demands. To that end, it is awaiting a response on three final requests made to the social media platform, which are registration, physical presence in Nigeria, and fair taxation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all these, Twitter hasn\u2019t given any official comment on the negotiations. In the meantime, the economic impact of the ban on the country keeps piling. As of August 2021, the country had lost over $360 million to the ban.\n\nIt goes without saying that citizens have found ways to circumvent the situation using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), an act the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, considers a crime and has threatened to prosecute defaulters.\n\nNot ignoring the contention that came with this move, it is essential to explore how possible it may be for Twitter to meet these requirements.\n\nAre these demands hard to meet?\n\nOn the surface, these demands are pretty simple. After all, it appears to be what the social media company would have agreed to before establishing an office in any country. Case in point, its entrance into Africa in April 2021 and the surprising choice of Ghana.\n\nBased on Twitter\u2019s comment, the decision was based on shared values \u2014 Ghana supports free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet.\n\nTrue to this, the country is one of the African countries without any case of Internet censorship or government-influenced social media censorship. Besides, Ghana currently ranks 30th on the World Press Freedom Index compared to Nigeria\u2019s 120th and Ethiopia\u2019s 101st.\n\nOn closer inspection, these aren\u2019t traits that the Nigerian government has exhibited in the past. There have been reported cases of the government slamming fines on media houses for using user-generated content (UGC) obtained from citizens\u2019 social media accounts in their reportage and tagging verified news reports from online media platforms as \u2018fake news.\u2019\n\nAlso, there is the issue of trust. And this can\u2019t be forced; it has to be earned. This Forbes article helps express the thoughts about opening an office overseas better. One of them is clearly understanding the law of the land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it appears Twitter\u2019s delay in reaching a compromise with the Nigerian government might be more in consideration of the government\u2019s motive and possible implications on the citizens and other global tech companies.\n\nWith a physical office, any move the government isn\u2019t comfortable with may cause closure or worse.\n\nIn January 2019, the Nigerian military raided the Daily Trust office and detained some staff on the allegation that it published an article that divulged classified military information related to planned attacks against Boko Haram and thus undermined national security.\n\nStill, Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, told Techpoint Africa that the decision is up to Twitter to make. However, he believes such a move isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nShould you worry?\n\n\u201cThis is one of the government\u2019s ways of doubling down. The truth is, this is not just about Twitter; it is clearly an agenda to retain and expand control,\u201d Sesan commented when asked about what the motive behind the ban is.\n\nHe also opined that the move to categorise Over-the-Top (OTT) services as broadcasters and make them liable under the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) Act is uncalled for. This means that WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix would have to apply to the Corporation to request a licence to operate in the country.\n\nBut what is surprising, according to Sesan, is that the government didn\u2019t reveal the details of the licence. In his defence, these platforms are only intermediaries.\n\nApparently, this is not the first time this move has been made in Nigeria. The first two times \u2014 2017 and 2019 \u2014 it was the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC)\u2019s call. Major players kicked against it, although telecommunication operators supported the government in this instance.\n\nAs clearly stated in a previous article, taking these licences will set the modalities for the provision of these services in Nigeria and would allow NCC to exercise some control over OTT services which is not currently in place.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation\u2026\n\nAll over the world, the OTT services marketplace is still nascent. But that does not change the fact that there is a need for some regulation. While some nations already have regulatory oversight in place \u2014 the United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya \u2014 others are seriously considering putting relevant laws in place. And interestingly, these platforms are often categorised as broadcasters.\n\nProtests against these types of regulatory regimes often happen when the government does not have clearly defined rules to guide them in enforcing the laws or when the government has displayed strongarm tactics in similar circumstances in the past.\n\nIt is important to note that there are either two motives for regulations, to increase government control and to enforce strict censorship or to create a level playing ground for both online and offline players. Sadly, this is common in African and Asian countries.\n\nFor instance, when Netflix launched in Kenya in 2018, it was banned for two weeks by the government, after which the on-demand video streaming platform was told to get a filming license. At the moment, the country already has a digital tax in place.\n\nCurrently, not only are global companies obliged to abide by laws and taxed by the countries they are registered in, but they might also be subject to foreign laws whether they are present physically or not.\n\nIn Sesan\u2019s opinion, although the Nigerian judiciary is not entirely independent, he trusts activist judges to do their work to give sound judgement on the current state of trampling on citizens\u2019 right to information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are purchased and sold online \u2014 usually using cryptocurrency \u2014 and are typically encoded with the same software as many cryptos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough they have been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining popularity as a popular way to buy and sell digital artwork.\n\nI know you\u2019re curious about NFTs, and our Reporter, Joy, has got you covered. She addressed three critical NFT questions that you might have.\n\nCheck them out here: 3 crucial questions about NFTs answered\n\nYou may also want to take a look at this: From designing album covers for Adekunle Gold and Blaqbonez, Anthony Azekwoh took a chance on NFTs and made a killing\n\nMIT to test 3D-printing for prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Moininah Sengeh working on prostheses\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s (MIT) new bionics centre \u2014 K.

The population of people with amputated limbs in Sierra Leone grows each year, with less than 10% currently benefiting from functional prostheses, according to MIT.\n\nHow will this be done? According to a statement by MIT, researchers will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customised prosthetics to disabled people.\n\nThe project, which aims to provide patients in medically underserved communities with access to prostheses, is one of four priorities for the research centre, established with $24 million in funding from philanthropist, Lisa Yang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2Africa Cable to connect 3 billion people to a faster Internet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, September 28th, 2021, Facebook announced that its 2Africa Cable, one of the world\u2019s largest subsea projects, would connect three continents \u2014 Africa, Europe, and Asia \u2014 with the addition of nine landings labelled the \u201c2Africa Pearls,\u201d allowing more people to connect to faster Internet.\n\nAccording to Facebook, when they are completed, the extension will make 2Africa the world\u2019s longest subsea cable system. It will break the current record of 39,000 kilometres set by the SEA-ME-WE 3 line, which connects 33 countries in South East Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe.\n\nThe 2Africa Pearls branch now includes new terrestrial connections via Egypt, Bahrain, India, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nPer the social media giant, with the addition of the Pearls extension, the system aims to connect an additional 1.8 billion people, bringing the total to 3 billion people spread across 33 countries, accounting for 36% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook announced plans to build a $1 billion undersea Internet cable for faster Internet access in Africa.\n\nAnd in August 2021, 2Africa extended the cable\u2019s connectivity to Seychelles, Angola, the Comoro Islands, and a new landing in South-East Nigeria.\n\nFor context on Subsea Internet Cables in Africa, please, read: Subsea Internet cables and the race to connect Africa to the Internet\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nGoogle Maps is making it easier to see wildfires and tree coverage.

          "text": "The insecurity across Nigeria got worse last week (September 24 \u2013 October 2) as at least 123 people including security personnel and civilians were killed in various attacks by non-state actors.\n\nThe figures, collated manually from media reports, do not contain unreported cases.\n\nOut of the 123 persons killed, four were security personnel while the other 119 were civilians.\n\nMost of the killings of security personnel which were mostly carried out by bandits occurred in the North-west and North-central zones, the epicentre of banditry activities.\n\nThe figures for the security personnel consist of two policemen and two soldiers.\n\nThe figure for last week is the highest weekly toll in the past month. There were less than 40 cases per week in the last three weeks.\n\nThe causes of the killings last week were similar to those of the previous weeks. They include terrorist attacks, banditry, and attacks by suspected separatists.\n\nBelow are the cases compiled from media reports last week.\n\nNorth-west\n\nAt least one person was killed and many others injured after gunmen attacked the ECWA Church at Gabaciwa village in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Sunday morning. According to a report by security agencies, the gunmen invaded the church during the Sunday morning service, and immediately attacked the worshipers, which led to the death, while some others were seriously injured.\n\nNo fewer than 34 people were killed following a fresh attack by gunmen on Madami village in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Seven other persons sustained injuries in the attack while some houses were also set ablaze during the operation which occurred on Sunday night.\n\nAlso in Kaduna State, at least eight persons were killed in what looked like a reprisal attack in Kacecere Village in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of the state on Monday. Seven persons were said to have sustained injuries in the attacks.\n\nIn Sokoto State, bandits on Tuesday night killed at least 20 people and abducted several others in Gatawa, a village in Sabon Birni Local Government Area. The agrarian community was considered to be one of the few secure villages in the eastern part of the state where bandits have been very active.\n\nAlso in Sokoto State, a resident was burnt alive while many policemen were unaccounted for in an attack that occurred in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of the state, on Wednesday.\n\nSouth-east\n\nGunmen went on rampage on two locations in Anambra State, killing two persons and wounding many at an APC rally. Armed persons also set ablaze a car belonging to a leader of the Chukwuma Soludo group. While the attack on APC took place during the party\u2019s rally at Uruagu, Nnewi, the attack on the leader of one of the Soludo support groups, Nelson Omenugha, took place at Nnobi in Idemili South Local Government Area of the state. Mr Soludo is the governorship candidate of APGA in the November 6 election in the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a separate incident, Chike Akunyili, the widower of the late former Minister of Information and Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dora Akunyili, was gruesomely murdered in Anambra state. The deceased was shot dead on Tuesday evening alongside seven others at Nkpor in the Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State.\n\nThe convoy of Emeka Azubogu, the lawmaker representing Nnewi North/Nnewi South/Ekwusigo Constituency in the House of Representatives, came under gun attack in Anambra State on Thursday. The lawmaker\u2019s driver was shot dead in the incident.\n\nThere was panic in Owerri, the Imo State capital, on Thursday, when officials of the Owerri Capital Development Authority and members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in the state clashed. While gunshots rent the air, a passer-by, who was later identified as Amaechi Udogaranya, was hit and killed by a stray bullet.\n\nSouth-west\n\nTwo police officers were feared dead as suspected armed robbers on Tuesday attacked a first generation bank in Iragbiji, Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State. Reports said that some people also sustained various degrees of injuries while the operation lasted.\n\nNorth-central\n\nThe Niger State Government said that over 30 people were killed by gunmen suspected to be bandits in Kachiwe and adjourning villages in Sarkin Pawa, headquarters of Munya Local Government Area of the state. The people were said to have been killed on Tuesday by the bandits who sneaked into the villages from their hideout in Kaduna State to execute the heinous act.\n\nAlso in Niger State, the police command confirmed the killing of three people by gunmen who attacked the palace of the Emir of Kagara in Rafi Local Government Area of the state.\n\nAlso in Niger State, 10 people were reportedly burnt alive, several others killed while seven women were said to have been kidnapped by bandits during an attack in the Kachiwe community in Sarkin Pawa Ward of Munya Local Government Area of the state during the week.\n\nThe state governor, Abubakar Bello, also confirmed the killing of two soldiers while 12 others were injured in a recent attack by suspected bandits in Kagara, the council headquarters of Rafi Local Government Area of the state.\n\nBuhari Speaks\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari last week acknowledged the worsening security situation across the country saying his administration was making efforts to reverse the trend.\n\nIn a speech to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Anniversary, Mr Buhari said his administration was recruiting more security personnel to address the shortage of manpower.\n\n\u201cTo support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years,\u201d the president said.",

It immediately announced its masterful presence as the nation charged to lead the rest of Africa away from the bondage of the ages.\n\nNigeria crafted a comprehensive Foreign Policy objective that has Africa as its centre piece and then deployed its vast human and material resources to pursue these objectives with vigour.\n\nNigerian diplomacy transcends its national interests because it captures the essence of the African renaissance with its immense contributions to the political and economic emancipation of the rest of Africa still under colonial rule and other forms of oppression around the world.\n\nNigeria\u2019s quest for global peace has seen unprecedented contributions it has made in peace keeping operations around the world. Nigerian troops were in the UN peace keeping role in the Congo in the 1960s. Nigerian contingent was in Burma, now Myanmar and many more countries on peace keeping missions.\n\nNigeria was regarded as the frontline state following its immense contributions to the liberation struggles in Southern Africa especially against the Apartheid regime in South Africa. The freedom of South Africa from Apartheid in 1994, the Independence of Zimbabwe in 1980 and the independence of Namibia in 1990, all had the footprints of Nigeria.\n\nNearer home in West Africa, Nigeria through the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) carried the burden of peace keeping and restoration of democratic order in Liberia, in Sierra Leone after both nations suffered brutal civil wars in the 1990s.\n\nAlthough Nigeria has made great diplomatic exploits in championing the political emancipation and peace of Africa and the rest of the third world, even to the current times, the world has changed so much in recent times such that the freedom which other nations obtained from Nigeria\u2019s sweat and blood may not have benefited Nigeria as events in recent times have proven.\n\nFor instance, South Africa, which enjoyed a large chunk of Nigeria\u2019s contributions to her freedom from Apartheid, appears to be at incessant loggerheads with Nigeria over the treatment some of its misguided citizens meted out to Nigerians living in the former Apartheid enclave. 2019 was the climax of the sustained xenophobic attacks against Nigerians in South Africa, where businesses belonging to Nigerians were attacked and looted with the South African government looking helpless.\n\nIn Ghana, the Nigerian government is currently battling to protect Nigerian citizens that have been subjected to sever discriminatory business policies and ceaseless attacks and closures of their businesses in the former Gold Coast.\n\nRecently in Indonesia, a Nigerian diplomatic, Abdulrahman Ibrahim, was molested by the country\u2019s immigration officials even when they knew his status. Before the controversy generated by this ugly incident could die down, a similar incident occurred in DR. Congo, where Nigerian diplomatic officials were subjected to very humiliating and harrowing experience allegedly by officials of that country.\n\nOrdinary innocent Nigerians, who have gone to seek greener pastures abroad have been killed or illegally detained in many countries of the world even though it must be acknowledged that some Nigerian citizens have engaged in criminal activities abroad.\n\nBut why would Nigeria, the giant, which made significant contributions to world peace and order be looking helpless while it fortunes dwindle around the world and its citizens disrespected, molested, jailed and in extreme cases killed?\n\nFormer Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bulus Lolo, in a recent interview with LEADERSHIP, blamed it on the current economic situation in the country in successive years, which has forced many of the country\u2019s citizens to look for greener pastures abroad and greatly affected the image of the country negatively.\n\nHe also called for a comprehensive review of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policy to reflect the national interest of the country in any foreign engagements.\n\nToday Nigeria is regarded as the poverty capital of the world according to Brookings Institute and World Poverty Clock, which suggests that nearly half of the nation\u2019s population of 200 million languishes in extreme poverty.\n\nIn the interview Ambassador Lolo said \u201cforeign policy is essentially a reflection of domestic policy, where what happens at home influences your action abroad. A stable, peaceful, prosperous Nigeria will project a Nigeria that is strong, a Nigeria that is vocal and a Nigeria that is active at the global level. And by so doing you will be able to extend your reach beyond your borders.\n\n\u201cBut for Nigeria to be referred to as the poverty capital of the world, I think is a challenge to our leaders because the issue of governance contributes to this undeserving description of Nigeria as the headquarters of poverty. Nigerians must demand from the leaders why they plunged the nation into poverty when we are so well endowed.\u201d\n\nHe called for foreign policy review saying, \u201cin the 60s, 70s, 80s and into the 90s, Apartheid for instance drove our Foreign Policy, but we are no longer dealing with a country under colonial domination, but today we have terrorism, climate change, globalization, COVID- 19, small arms and light weapons.\n\n\u201cThe content of our foreign policy should respond to our development agenda in the UN and other international organizations.\u201d",

Of course, Pere who has been tagged \u2018The General \u2018\u2019 by his fans has shown how much of a big force he is in the last voting broadcast which saw him rising shoulder high ahead of most of his mates, with exception to Whitemoney and Liquorose.\n\nMassive campaigns have been going on in the days preceding the finale, and the busiest camps have been in the Liquorose and Whitemoney camps. While the majority of the South-east people are rooting for Whitemoney, the South-south states have pulled their weight behind Liquorose.\n\nOther four Housemates have been enjoying fringe interests without any particular base. In Lagos which is a hotbed of activities, it has been a tough tussle between Liquorose and Whitemoney. While Whitemoney seems to have his stronghold in the Computer Village of Ikeja, Liquorose is reigning supreme in the Surulere suburb with various groups championing the cause.\n\nIn the opinion of Potpourri, it is too close to call between Liquorose and Whitemoney. But they are sure to come first and second in no particular order. Pere, seems to have the third spot all cut out for him unless Biggie decides to play his wild card. Push or shove, Whitemoney looks better for the money but then Liquorose may just follow in the footsteps of Mercy Eke as the second woman to have won the reality TV show.

Of course, Pere who has been tagged \u2018The General \u2018\u2019 by his fans has shown how much of a big force he is in the last voting broadcast which saw him rising shoulder high ahead of most of his mates, with exception to Whitemoney and Liquorose.\n\nMassive campaigns have been going on in the days preceding the finale, and the busiest camps have been in the Liquorose and Whitemoney camps. While the majority of the South-east people are rooting for Whitemoney, the South-south states have pulled their weight behind Liquorose.\n\nOther four Housemates have been enjoying fringe interests without any particular base. In Lagos which is a hotbed of activities, it has been a tough tussle between Liquorose and Whitemoney. While Whitemoney seems to have his stronghold in the Computer Village of Ikeja, Liquorose is reigning supreme in the Surulere suburb with various groups championing the cause.\n\nIn the opinion of Potpourri, it is too close to call between Liquorose and Whitemoney. But they are sure to come first and second in no particular order. Pere, seems to have the third spot all cut out for him unless Biggie decides to play his wild card. Push or shove, Whitemoney looks better for the money but then Liquorose may just follow in the footsteps of Mercy Eke as the second woman to have won the reality TV show.

          "text": "Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah of Catholic Diocese of Sokoto has drawn attention once again to the perilous state of Nigeria, declaring that the nation is decomposing from within.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a broken country. It is decomposing from within. Our heart is broken and lives are hemorrhaging by the day\u201d, he said.\n\nKukah spoke in a sermon on 23 September at the Priestly Ordination of Five Deacons at the Holy Family Cathedral.\n\nThe church made available the text of the sermon to coincide with Nigeria\u2019s 61st anniversary as an independent country.\n\nKukah wondered why the Buhari government has refused to release the names of Boko Haram sponsors.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go on like this\u201d, he said.\n\nThe priest, who is known for always telling truth to power noted that\n\nthe country and people have become so traumatised and sedated by horrible news, that have now become comfortable in \u201cthis swamp of evil\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo number of horrific deaths, murders, sexual violence and kidnapping of children or adults can make us stop our life of debauchery. Life goes in Nigeria! We become experts at burying the dead, but refuse to ask why the killings continue.\n\n\u201cMorally, we cannot tell what time it is. We cannot overstate the reality. It is clear that neither politics nor economic models can fix the country.\n\n\u201cThe political class is in the state of inebriation with the drug of power and loot.\n\n\u201cWe neither know what is wrong nor who is wrong. We are hiding under the belief that the proponents or the apostles of this culture of death that has turned our country into an inferno have neither name or address.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has told us it is not ready to publicise the names of those funding Boko Haram. We cannot go on like this.\n\n\u201cInterrogating, questioning these existential threats to our common humanity is the apostolate that we Priests are called to.\n\n\u201cWe know that this road is dangerous, it is rocky, it is treacherous, it takes lives, but it is all too familiar.\n\n\u201cWe Christians know its name: it is metaphorically called Golgotha. If Golgotha was a footpath, the resurrection blasted a high way to redemption on it\u201d.\n\nJust as he declared Nigeria broken, Kukah said the people are also broken.\n\nEverywhere we turn, the bodies and the emotions of men and women are irretrievably broken.\n\n\u201cOur people, fleeing their homes after over ten years have now turned Refugee camps into their habitats.\n\n\u201cOur identity as citizens is being traded for the status of migrants and refugees.\n\n\u201cThe civic space is slowly closing as citizens are losing ordinary freedoms to the crippling hands of totalitarianism.\n\nKukah urged priests to offer a clearer path for the nation, ensuring that even when the Lord sleeps, He is awake and that the boat will not sink. We only need to banish our fears and trust in Him.\n\n\u201cLet us reaffirm our commitment to the fact that, as the holy book says, There is a time for everything under the sun. A time for corona and a time for ending corona.\n\n\u201cA time for kidnapping and a time for stopping kidnapping. A time for living and a time for dying. It is for a time like this that the priesthood was instituted.\n\n\u201cTimes like these compel us to rethink why the Lord instituted the priesthood. We then pause and thank Him for this wonderful gift.\n\n\u201cWe must encourage our people to return to the silent sacredness of the Blessed Sacrament and avoid the BetNaija mentality that believes that everything simply depends on magic and luck.\n\n\u201cFaith is not based on luck. It is, as the Catechism says, \u201ca gift of God which enables us to believe\u201d.\n\nREAD the full sermon here",

So, we felt that if the northern caucus of the National Assembly \u2013 in the House of Reps \u2013 would come to see how he is recuperating, we thought that it would mean so much.\n\n\u201cHe really appreciated our coming because he said he rated our coming second after the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari. He mentioned that governors and others came but this is a mini Nigeria in the House of Reps, for the entire northern caucus to find time to come and see how he is faring.\n\n\u201cHe stood up and walked. I\u2019m sure you have seen the video. I think he has recovered; he is not doing badly at all \u2013 this is not politics. I think because of his age, he has to still go for physiotherapy and things like that. These are things that will take time for him to fully do some politicking. He will soon come back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in one of the videos from the visit, which has gone viral on the Internet, the lawmaker representing Guevara/Suleja/Tafa Federal Constituency in Niger State, Lado Suleja, called Tinubu \u201cMr President.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers were seen accompanying Tinubu to a waiting car, during which Suleja said, \u201cMr President, see you soon,\u201d and the ex-governor replied, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the visit, the source added, \u201cI will not say he is speaking for the caucus. Lado is his loyalist. He has been Tinubu\u2019s loyalist for a long time, we know that. It was Lado that made that statement. All of us \u2013 even me \u2013 wish he is our President.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to confirm Asiwaju\u2019s endorsement, Ado-Doguwa stated that it was a \u2018get-well visit.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u201cI am neither the leader of the delegation nor come as the Northern Caucus, perhaps not the right person to answer your question. But on a personal note, I can tell you that I was on this mission to simply pay a \u2018get-well visit\u2019 to the National Leader of our party, the APC, like many other Nigerians have done, including Mr President. My religion and tradition allow for such visits to the sick.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, stand bold to say that I wish Bola Ahmed Tinubu well and pray for his fast recovery. I am further glad to say that I met him in an improved and very encouraging health Condition.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in another video, the former governor said he was healthy but only undergoing physiotherapy in London. He said this while addressing the northern caucus.\n\nTinubu, who was dressed in Kaftan and a red cap, has been in the United Kingdom for about three months after undergoing knee surgery. He however described the physiotherapy as gruesome. \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome,\u201d he added.\n\nTinubu\u2019s health had become a subject of controversy of late but in a statement on July 31, 2021, his Media Adviser, Tunde Rahman, said though the former governor was out of Nigeria, he was not hospitalised as claimed by some persons.\n\n\u201cHe (Tinubu) is out of the country at the moment. He will be back shortly,\u201d he said, adding that his boss was \u201chale and hearty\u201d.\n\nSince he arrived in London, Tinubu\u2019s London home has somewhat become a Mecca. He had been visited by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nOthers who visited Tinubu include a former governor of Ogun State and incumbent Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun; former Governor of Borno State and Senator representing Borno Central, Kashim Shettima; and member representing Gubio, Kaga and Magumeri Federal Constituency of Borno State, Usman Zanna.\n\nAlso on the list are Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat; Chief of Staff to Lagos State Governor, Tayo Ayinde; Deputy Chief of Staff to Lagos State Governor, Gboyega Soyannwo; Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Education, Tokunbo Wahab; former APC National Legal Adviser, Muiz Banire.\n\nThe Senator representing Lagos East Senatorial District, Adetokunbo Abiru; Senator Adeola Solomon from Lagos West; Senator Opeyemi Bamidele from Ekiti Central; Senator Adelere Oriolowo from Osun West; and Senator Mohammed Sanni from Niger East also visited the ex-Lagos governor in London.\n\nOthers are Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa; Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation, Temitope Adewale; Chairman of the House Committee on Physical Planning and Urban Development, Nureni Akinsanya; as well as Chairman of the House Committee on Overseas Investments and Sustainable Development Goals, Sylvester Ogunkelu.\n\nThe Chairman of Isolo Local Council Development Area, Adebayo Olasoju; another politician, Adekunle Akanbi; and popular Fuji musician, Wasiu Ayinde, popularly called KWAM 1, also visited Tinubu in London.\n\nAkeredolu and Fayemi had said their visit was not about 2023 but to pay him a courtesy visit. Meanwhile, Akeredolu added, \u201cHe\u2019s the capo (di tutti) for us here. By the time he comes, we can make some important decisions.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when asked in an interview if Tinubu discussed his plans for 2023 with him, Gbajabiamila said his discussion with the APC leader \u201cwas privileged\u201d.\n\nHis long stay abroad Read has however drawn criticism from some Nigerians who argued that his prolonged medical trip was not a good signal if indeed he planned to become the president.\n\nReno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, had said should Tinubu become President in 2023, he would continue Buhari\u2019s tradition of seeking treatment abroad at the expense of taxpayers.\n\nIn recent years, the UK has become a choice destination for the Nigerian elite including Buhari, who frequent London for medical tourism while perpetual industrial actions, lack of modern equipment, inadequate personnel, failure of government to pay doctors\u2019 salaries, amongst others, mar Nigeria\u2019s health sector.\n\nIn a related development, the chairman, South-West Agenda for Ahmed Tinubu 2023, a group campaigning for Tinubu\u2019s candidacy, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, said Tinubu\u2019s health should not be a concern because, according to him, the health and life of men are in the hands of God.\n\nIn an interview with one of our correspondents, Adeyeye, while responding to a question on the health of their candidate, said, \u201cLet us not make his health a major concern. The health and the life of a man are in the hands of God Almighty. Even a person who seems healthy today might collapse and die tomorrow.\n\n\u201cSo, issues beyond the realm of human beings should be left in the hands of God. Some people thought Buhari would not survive his health challenge about four years ago but look at him today. I won\u2019t react to those who want to make the health of Asiwaju Tinubu a subject of politics.\n\n\u201cI was the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP when Buhari was sick but I never made issues out of his condition, despite being in the opposition party then because as a Christian, I know such a matter could only be determined by God Almighty.\n\n\u201cThose who travelled abroad to see him came back with a very good report. They said he is hale and hearty and that his health hasn\u2019t deteriorated in any way.\u201d\n\nGroup tackles Tinubu over godfatherism in Lagos Meanwhile, the intra-party disagreements in the Lagos chapter of APC seem to be festering as one of the groups in the party, Lagos4Lagos Movement, has continued to express its resolve to change the status quo. The group maintained that a situation where one man would decide who governs the state should be stopped.\n\nThe disagreement worsened during the ward and local government congresses as the APC had parallel congresses.\n\nA former Secretary to the Lagos State Government and apex chairperson of Lagos4Lagos, Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya, told Sunday PUNCH that it was unacceptable for one person to single-handedly decide who would occupy political positions in Lagos.\n\nHe added, \u201cEverybody knows that there is godfatherism in Lagos. Nobody can deny that. As a people, we must be able to make our choices; we must be able to vote for those who are capable of doing the job.\n\n\u201cLagos4Lagos means the money of Lagos should stay in Lagos and the benefits should not appear only in one man\u2019s pocket. Many are waiting for them to be called upon and say \u2018you are going to be the next governor.\u2019 This should not be so. We should have a governor we all choose and have confidence in.\n\n\u201cI think God allowed what has happened to us in order to teach us a lesson. This is the time we must use that lesson to make changes. I am not afraid of any human being. I respect older people and people generally, but definitely not afraid. I have no apology.\n\n\u201cAs of the time he (Tinubu) was trying to change (Babatunde) Fashola, we were successful in stopping them. I don\u2019t think anybody is high and mighty. I am afraid of God, definitely not any leader but I will have respect for that leader. Is he not a human being like me?\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that Lagos would be stronger and better when no godfather is allowed to choose for Lagosians. \u201cFor goodness sake, from 1999 till now, you have had the opportunity of taking us for a ride, you must know that there is a limit; it is only for some time,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, the Lead Visioner for Lagos4Lagos, Jide Adediran, urged the people to use their power to choose their leaders.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe often shy away from our responsibilities as followers. We habitually fail to use our powers to choose as enshrined in our constitution. It has always been \u2018My votes will not count\u2019, \u2018It is a waste of time\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t bother, they will rig it anyway\u2019, \u2018APC and PDP are the same, and I can\u2019t vote for either.\u2019\n\n\u201cThese are some of the reasons why the highest votes in Lagos was 1.8 million, barely 28 per cent of the 6.5 million eligible voters. This was in 2011. It has been on a steady decline since then up to the 2019 election that saw the current Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, getting elected by only 12 per cent of the eligible voters in Lagos. This was by far the poorest of all outings.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking to Sunday PUNCH, a member of the movement, Sunday Ajayi, said godfatherism had caused a lot of problems in Nigeria\u2019s democracy. \u201cThe era of godfatherism is gone. That is why we are saying the ward and state executives must work with us,\u201d he added.\n\nBut the spokesperson for Lagos APC, Seyi Oladejo, challenged Lagos4Lagos members to test their polarity at the poll rather than giving excuses, adding that contrary to the claim by Lagos4Lagos, Tinubu had not been overbearing in his leadership style.\n\nHe said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t have the structure; you don\u2019t have the pedigree, you don\u2019t have the antecedent and acceptance, you only have yourself to blame; maybe you need to have a rethink and re-strategise.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing like Asiwaju being overbearing or that he lords it over others in Lagos APC or wherever. There is nothing wrong for them (Lagos4Lagos) to be ambitious; that is the beauty of democracy. But until they test their popularity at the poll, their only hope remains in the realm of conjecture. I can assure you that we have tested and experienced soldiers who have weathered many political challenges.\u201d",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201curgently withdraw the impermissible conditions imposed on Twitter pending the final determination of the suit at the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja challenging the legality\u201d of suspending the microblogging platform.\n\nAccording to a statement on Sunday by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP urged the president to withdraw the clauses in a bid to allow the court render a decision on the central issues in the case, and protect the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and interests.\n\nPresident Buhari had stated in his address to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61th independence anniversary, that the Federal Government would only lift the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria if certain conditions, including concerns around national security, are met.\n\nThe address also seems to suggest that even when the suspension is lifted, Nigerians will only be allowed to use Twitter \u201cfor business and positive engagements.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Abducted Zamfara Speaker\u2019s Father Reportedly Dies In Kidnappers\u2019 Den\n\nHowever, in an open letter dated 2 October 2021, SERAP said: \u201cThe conditions imposed on Twitter while the ECOWAS case is pending constitute an interference with the right of SERAP and other plaintiffs to fairly and effectively pursue a judicial challenge to the decision by your government to suspend Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe organization said: \u201cThe conditions make a mockery of the case pending before the ECOWAS court, and create a risk that the course of justice will be seriously impeded or prejudiced in this case. Protecting the right to a judicial recourse and due administration of justice is of utmost importance, being the cornerstone of an ordered society.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cImposing impermissible conditions on Twitter would undermine the rights and interests of the Plaintiffs in the ECOWAS Court case filed against your government, as the conditions directly touch on the central issues of freedom of expression and access to information, which the court is set to determine and rule upon.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cPushing conditions on Twitter while the ECOWAS case is pending would prejudice the interests of the Plaintiffs, undermine the ability of ECOWAS court to do justice in the case, damage public confidence in the court, and prejudice the outcome of the case.\n\n\u201cIt is in the public interest to keep the streams of justice clear and pure, and to maintain the authority of the ECOWAS court in the case. If not immediately withdrawn, the conditions would seriously undermine Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations including under ECOWAS treaties and protocols, and have serious consequences for the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that the only way in which SERAP and other plaintiffs can have a fair and effective access to justice is to allow the court to decide on the merits of the case before it, fairness and justice must, on the facts of the ECOWAS case, outweigh any stated national security conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour government should allow the ECOWAS Court to decide these issues, especially as the Federal Government has made the arguments on national security before the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe core of the principle of judicial independence is the complete liberty of the judge to hear and decide the cases before them on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any improper interference, direct or indirect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe principle of the independence of the judiciary has also been enshrined in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, endorsed by the General Assembly in 1985.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Principles provide, inter alia, that it is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary (principle 1); that judges shall decide matters before them impartially without any restrictions or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason (principle 2); and that there shall not be any inappropriate or unwarranted interference with the judicial process (principle 4).\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged the president to urgently withdraw the conditions imposed on Twitter, and to allow the ECOWAS court to decide on the suit brought by the organization and other plaintiffs challenging the legality of the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, as judgment in the suit is fixed for 20th, January 2022.",

He described the incident as evil and inhuman.\n\nHe also decried the recent terrible activities of bandits in Shiroro and Munya Local Government Areas, where many villagers were killed, burned, and others kidnapped, while the criminals also set houses and food bans ablaze.\n\nAccording to the governor, there is an urgent need for a total overhaul of the strategy and security apparatus following the fresh attacks carried out by the bandits.\n\nHe, however, stressed that the security operatives were capable of curtailing the situation and called for more support from residents with useful and timely information.\n\nGovernor Bello prayed for the repose of the souls of those killed, the quick recovery of those injured, and the safe return of all persons kidnapped by the bandits.\n\nHe assured the people of his administration\u2019s commitment to tackling banditry and other forms of security challenges in the state.\n\nReports had emerged that Boko Haram terrorists have captured many communities in eight wards of Shiroro LGA.\n\nThe Chairman of the lga, Suleiman Chukuba, who briefed reporters on Friday explained that the insurgents attempted to incorporate and recruit residents of the communities to become members.\n\nHe added that the insurgents were making efforts to equip the people to fight against the government, saying they proclaimed that they do not want conventional primary and secondary schools, but an Islamic school.\n\nThe lga boss, therefore, appealed to the Federal Government to deploy more security personnel in the area to help dislodge the criminals whom he said have made Shiroro their home.",

          "text": "Positive clinical trial results for Merck & Co\u2019s experimental antiviral COVID-19 pill reverberated through the healthcare sector on Friday, sending the drugmaker\u2019s stock price soaring while denting high-flying shares of vaccine companies and makers of other coronavirus therapies.\n\nMerck shares jumped as much as 12.3% and hit their highest level since February 2020 after data showed the company\u2019s pill molnupiravir could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe COVID-19. Experts hailed the news as potentially a huge advance in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nAt the same time, shares of vaccine makers such as Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE were hit, with some analysts saying the promise of an oral drug that can be taken at home could change the public perception of risks associated with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe see modest perceived headwind to vaccine stocks such as MRNA (Moderna) if the market thinks people will be less afraid of COVID-19 and less inclined to get vaccines, if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID-19,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a client note.\n\nModerna shares tumbled 13% in midday trading, while Pfizer, which is developing a COVID-19 pill of its own, fell 1.3%. U.S. shares of BioNTech dropped 11%.\n\nFor Moderna investors, the Merck news presented an opportunity to lock in gains after an already stunning run.\n\nShares of Moderna, which were added to the S&P 500 in mid July, remain up some 220% in 2021 despite Friday\u2019s declines. BioNTech\u2019s shares were also still up about 200% for the year, even with Friday\u2019s fall.\n\nThe Merck news is a \u201cgreat reason for folks to be taking profits off the table\u201d in Moderna and BioNTech shares, said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.\n\n\u201cThese moves can get exacerbated to the downside given the momentum they have had to the upside.\u201d\n\nShares of other companies with COVID-19 vaccines also fell, with AstraZeneca down 2% and Novavax falling 16%.\n\nCompanies with other COVID-19 therapies that are administered intravenously or through injection also traded lower, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals down nearly 5% and Gilead Sciences Inc off about 2%.\n\nHealthcare was the only one of the 11 S&P 500 sectors in negative territory in mid-day trading, falling 0.5%.\n\n\u201cWe see molnupiravir, with its oral format as a clear game changer that is likely to meaningfully impact not just the treatment paradigm for COVID-19 but also has potential utility in the prevention setting,\u201d Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said in a research note.\n\nMerck is conducting a late-stage trial to see if its antiviral pill can prevent COVID-19 infection, in addition to the study that showed it can significantly cut hospitalization and death in those already infected.\n\nMerck, whose shares were last up about 9%, leads the race in developing the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19. Rivals such as Pfizer and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG with partner Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc are running late-stage trials of their pills. Atea shares were up 19%.\n\nMerck, which discontinued its own COVID-19 vaccine program, had seen its shares fall about 4% for the year through Thursday, before they moved into positive territory for 2021 on Friday.\n\n\u201cMerck has kind of been dead in the water to investors for the past couple of quarters,\u201d said Kevin Gade, portfolio manager with Bahl & Gaynor, which owns Merck shares.\n\n\u201cThis shows their R&D engine is not dead and they were first \u2026 in what could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity.\u201d",

The measure, which went into effect last month, is the most restrictive in the country.\n\n\u201cNo matter where you live, no matter where you are, this moment is dark,\u201d Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood, told the crowd at the \u201cRally for Abortion Justice\u201d in Washington.\n\nIn the Texas capital of Austin, hundreds gathered in sweltering heat to denounce the so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d law signed by Governor Greg Abbott. It bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo, usually around six weeks. That is before most women know they are pregnant and earlier than 85% to 90% of all abortions are carried out, experts say.\n\nThe law relies on ordinary citizens to enforce the ban, which makes no exceptions for rape or incest, rewarding them at least $10,000 if they successfully sue anyone who helped provide an illegal abortion.\n\nSome of the demonstrators said the law would backfire on legislators. \u201cI think more people believe in the issue of providing safe abortions than our legislature realizes,\u201d said Andrea Roberts, 49, an Austin preschool director.",

          "text": "Globacom, the second-largest telecoms operator in Nigeria by subscriber number and market share, has signed a deal with Eutelsat of France for satellite deployment in the Nigerian market.\n\nThe business deal, which was signed between the two companies at the Elysee Palace in Paris recently, was witnessed by the French President, Mr. Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe Chairman of Globacom, Chief Mike Adenuga, signed on behalf of Globacom, while Eutelsat CEO, Rodolphe Belmer, signed on behalf of Eutelsat of France.\n\nThe partnership deal is coming at a time when the federal government has approved the rollout of the 5G network in Nigeria, which will boost internet connectivity in urban and rural communities.\n\nThe partnership between the two companies is expected to enhance the deployment of 500 Wi-Fi relay stations to far-flung rural areas, for connection to a Eutelsat satellite.\n\nLikewise, French group, Vocalcom, which already manages the software for Glo telecom\u2019s call centres in Nigeria, is hoping to open a new deal in the mobile-money sphere with Globacom.\n\nAccording to Adenuga, his franchise\u2019s relationship with the French telecoms giant has been a long and extremely beneficial one.\n\n\u201cThe genesis and bedrock of that relationship was the energy team at the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) Paris office, led by Guillaume Leenhardt. A great deal of our early success can be attributed to the professionalism, customer orientation, and creativity of that team,\u201d Adenuga said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe worked extremely hard and well together to meet some ridiculously tight deadlines \u2013 working through the night till 6 a.m. only to resume work again at 8 a.m. after a quick nap and shower. Those are days I remember with a lot of fondness.\n\n\u201cSoon after the award of our telecommunications licence in 2003, our relationship with another prominent French company, Alcatel, led at the time by Serge Tchuruk, enabled us to fast-track the roll-out of our infrastructure and close the gap on the competition, which had had a 15-month head start.\u201d\n\nBack in 2017, the French government, in homage to Adenuga\u2019s humanity and relentless strides at rewriting the African business narrative, invested him with a Knight of the Legion of Honour (Chevalier de la Legion d Honneur), the highest French decoration and one of the most famous in the world.\n\nAdenuga became the only Nigerian to have received the award since its inception.\n\nHe was honoured for his remarkable contribution to the development of French-Nigerian relations and his appreciation of French culture.\n\nFollowing the honour accorded him, Adenuga later relocated and rebuilt the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, which for several decades was located in Yaba, Lagos.\n\nThe Alliance Fran\u00e7aise is committed to promoting French culture and teaching French as a second language around the world and has been named Mike Adenuga Centre, immediately after the relocation. Since it was declared open to the public in 2019, the centre has been getting commendations from far and near.\n\nWhile inaugurating the centre during his visit to Lagos, President Macron said the centre was aimed at fostering friendship between Nigeria and France.\n\n\u201cLagos is one of the challenges of, not only Nigeria but Africa. This huge city is a tremendous challenge about how to make people live together in peace. I want France to be part of this story. I do want my country and its citizens to be part of this experience, which means sharing the same values, cultures, languages, literature, music, movies, and common economic projects, among others,\u201d Macron said during his visit to Nigeria.\n\nEmma Okonji",

          "text": "As the world moves to tackle climate change, the International Oil Companies (IOCs), which insist on ramping up production of fossil fuels in Africa may face the risk of regulatory action from the United States, the country\u2019s Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, Jonathan Pershing, has said.\n\nIf the US makes good its threat, it will be a major blow to Nigeria, Angola, Congo and other oil-producing countries in Africa, which have intensified efforts to attract foreign investors to fund major hydrocarbons projects on the continent.\n\nThis is coming as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, are considering going beyond the existing deal to boost production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) when it meets tomorrow (Monday).\n\nIn August, President Muhammadu Buhari finally signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to spur competition in the sector as well as attract foreign investments.\n\nBut with the position of the US, many of the expected funding for Nigeria\u2019s fossil fuels may be stranded since oil companies would be circumspect about putting their dollars in the upcoming projects.\n\nWestern fossil fuel companies planning to develop new projects in Africa would then need to consider the significant risk of regulatory action vis-\u00e0-vis the returns on investment in Africa.\n\nSpeaking from South Africa, the US envoy urged western investors to consider whether fossil fuels were a good commercial opportunity anymore in Africa or anywhere else.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of regulatory \u2026 and financial activities, and I believe that\u2019s getting more and more explicit. If you are a company looking to invest in oil and gas, you have to ask yourself\u2026\u2018am I going to be left with a stranded asset?\u2019 I would not bet very strongly on a fossil fuel future,\u201d he said.\n\nPershing, who was speaking at a virtual media briefing, after being asked about the current rush by western oil and gas companies to develop deposits in Africa, noted that even China had committed to stop building overseas coal plants.\n\nAfrica accounts for just 3.8 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the non-profit Carbon Disclosure Project, but Pershing noted it was the fastest-growing continent.\n\nIt could, he said: \u201cleapfrog\u201d older carbon-based technologies and embrace renewables, just as it skipped wired telecoms in many places and went straight for wireless.\n\n\u201cAfrica doesn\u2019t need to move in the direction of the West\u2019s high-carbon intensity. It can move directly beyond that,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments came despite the United States itself being a major producer and exporter of oil and gas, with recent growth driven by output from shale fields, a Reuters report said.\n\nThe US envoy is visiting several African countries as part of efforts to raise global climate ambition ahead of the United Nations COP26 Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland next month.\n\nAfrican nations are seeking financial assistance from the West to switch to renewables.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa, the continent\u2019s biggest greenhouse gas emitter and the world\u2019s 12th largest, owing to its reliance on coal-fired power, told the envoy that it needed major support for its energy transition.\n\nIn the new PIA, Nigeria is devoting as much as 30 per cent of the proposed Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit gas, to crude exploration in the frontier basins.\n\nSpeaking recently on why Nigeria continued to focus on a seemingly irrelevant resource, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva as well as the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, had noted that the idea was to get as much oil as possible from beneath the ground before it becomes useless.\n\nMost of the big IOCs like Royal Dutch Shell, Mobil, Chevron which operates in the United States also have major investments in Nigeria and could withdraw funding for Nigerian hydrocarbons if threatened in that country.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

Sule Lamido is also being considered. But most of the elders are saying that if Shema or Lamido runs, it could stop the North-west from bringing the vice presidential candidate to a southern presidential candidate because the southern governors in the party are determined that the presidency should go to the South, in line with the resolutions of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, and they are looking at one of their own as a candidate, despite all the blackmail,\u201d the source explained.\n\nHowever, the source added that the loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki are moving to use the court to return Secondus.\n\n\u201cIf they return Secondus, they can take control of the party, and retain the presidency in the North in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has summoned an emergency NEC meeting for Thursday, October 7, at its national headquarters, to consider the report of the zoning of the offices of the NWC.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Umaru Ibrahim Tsauri, all members of the National Executive Committee are invited to the emergency NEC meeting.\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Chuks Okocha in Abuja",
