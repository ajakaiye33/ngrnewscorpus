          "title": "IYC wants Jonathan\u2019s convoy crash probed, Wike, UNIPORT mourn",
          "text": "The Ijaw Youths Council Worldwide on Thursday called on security agencies to thoroughly investigate the auto crash in the convoy of former President Goodluck Jonathan which left two policemen dead and two others injured in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nThe IYC\u2019s National President, Peter Igbifa, in a statement in Port Harcourt said the probe was necessary because of the council\u2019s suspicion that the crash was a premeditated attempt on Jonathan\u2019s life by some \u201cconspirators.\u201d\n\nIgbifa claimed that the orderlies used themselves as human shields for Jonathan and, in the process, paid the ultimate price, describing their action as the highest level of sacrifice.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is obvious that some people are after the former President. They want him dead and we believe it is not unconnected with the constant appearance of his name in the forthcoming 2023 election.\n\n\u201cTo such satanic agents, the only way to stop the rumoured plot to return Jonathan to Aso Rock in 2023 is to eliminate him.\n\n\u201cWe know in Nigeria, there is nothing desperate politicians, who see others as a threat to their ambitions, cannot do.\u201d\n\nIgbifa called on security agencies to beef up security around the former President.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on security agencies to rise up to their responsibilities and beef up security around the former President.\n\n\u201cThey should probe this accident and make public the circumstances that led to it. The blood of our hero cannot be used to settle political scores,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has expressed gratitude to God for making the former President Jonathan escape unhurt in the crash.\n\nWike, in a statement by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiris, said it was a thing of joy that Jonathan came out unscathed.\n\n\u201cI was so elated to hear that President Goodluck Jonathan escaped unhurt. I thank God Almighty for sparing his life and that of others in the convoy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said he was devastated to hear that two police aides of the former President lost their lives, while others sustained injuries in the accident.\n\nWike added, \u201cIt is very heartbreaking to hear that the accident claimed the lives of two police personnel. May God grant their families the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\n\u201cI pray to God to give President Jonathan all the strength to overcome the scars of this painful accident.\u201d\n\nAlso, the University of Port Harcourt Alumni Association has commiserated with Jonathan over the death of the two policemen.\n\nThe association\u2019s National President, Ule Williams, in a condolence message on Thursday, thanked God for saving the life of Jonathan.\n\nWilliams stated, \u201cWe give thanks to the Almighty God for saving the life of the former President, Dr Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\u201cWhile giving God praise for saving the life of our beloved grand patron, loving father and leader par excellence, we call on road users to apply caution while using the roads to forestall avoidable accidents.\n\n\u201cMay the good Lord continue to protect the life of our grand patron.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Banditry: How I slept in bush for 19 days to escape from bandits \u2014 Pastor Dauda Yosi Kwaki",
          "text": "fate of wife and children unknown 2 months after\n\nBy Wole Mosadomi, Minna\n\nFOR the past three months, bandits have shifted their onslaught to Shiroro and Munya local government areas of Niger State. In the past few years, 18 of the 25 local government areas have been under the siege of the bandits, but now full attention has been shifted to Shiroro and Munya. In these two local government areas, no fewer than 100 communities have been sacked and the natives taken to Gwada where they are being camped as refugees.\n\nLife is unbearable for them there because of the exploding population and without sufficient food, water and medicines to take care of them. In Shiroro Local Government Area, there are15 political wards with many communities, while there are 13 political wards in Munya with many other communities looking for means of sustenance. But virtually all the communities in these two local government areas have been sacked by bandits who raid them at will, kill, maim, raze their houses or food barns and abduct those they want at will.\n\nThose who were lucky to escape the onslaught have gory tales of what they passed and still passing through to tell. One of them is Pastor Dauda Yosi Kwaki of Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church in Mangorata Town in Munya Local Government Area of the state. Pastor Kwaki spoke with Arewa Voice after escaping massacre by the bandits along with his family of eight.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur community was invaded by the bandits on March 27 and they broke into my church and residence with the aim of killing me and my family, but God saved us. Out of annoyance, they destroyed the pulpit, chairs, drums and other musical instruments they met. They also forced the door of my house open and carted away all valuables they could lay their hands on. I was hiding by the river close to my church with others also in the bush and heard them banging on the doors of the church. I escaped into a nearby bush where I stayed for 19 days virtually with nothing to eat or drink before I finally escaped to Gurusu village where I am presently managing.\u201d\n\nPastor Kwaki said he has one wife and seven children, but that they are now forced to stay apart as a result of frequent bandit attacks on them. \u201cMy wife and five of our seven children have temporarily relocated to Nasarawa State, while the two other children are now in Gurusu in Niger State. Since January, I have not been able to see my wife and the other five children, while I have not also set eyes on the two others residing in Niger state,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile noting that residents in these two local government areas cannot specifically explain the cause of the frequent raid on them by the gunmen, he said: \u201cSince we have been residing in these communities, we have never witnessed the type of raid on us like it happened few weeks ago. The bandits rode on 300 motorcycles with each carrying no fewer than two passengers and fully armed. They divided themselves into three groups with some in Kapana and Dangunu from where they carried out their dastardly act on the people.\u201d\n\nThe pastor called on local, state and federal governments to join hands to fight the bandits whom he said have taken over the state, especially Munya and Shiroro local government areas. On the likelihood of the villagers returning to their ancestral homes to continue with their lives, he said the people have to choose between life and death. \u201cExcept there are strong indications by government to provide the fleeing villagers adequate security, going back to the communities may not be feasible for now because the bandits are still in their locations close to the two local government areas and still ravaging the people.\u201d\n\nThe man of God said that in the past few months, most churches in these two Christian dominated local government areas have not been able to worship freely as most members have fled the communities after having close shave with death on several occasions. The state Commissioner for Local Government and Internal Security, Emmanuel Umar, in an interview with Arewa Voice, said the state had taken steps to review the security architecture of Munya LGA following incessant attacks on some communities there.",

          "title": "Birnin Gwari: Seized by terrorists, avoided by natives, emirate risks extinction",
          "text": "File: Bandits\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo, Kaduna\n\nIT is a sad story that unnerves, but the natives are helpless and hapless as there is nothing they can do to avert what befell them. They are unhappy that their beloved community has been effortlessly taken over by criminals who first started as cattle rustlers, then morphed into bandits and finally as kidnappers and terrorists. They now boldly unleash terror on anyone and everyone with impunity. It is painful to the people of Birnin Gwari, a community richly endowed with fauna and flora by nature and situated within the corridor lying between Abuja and Kaduna. It is an endowment which naturally should fetch them fortunes, but is now avoided and dreaded, with the name easily associated with terrorists and evildoers any time it is mentioned.\n\nIt appears difficult for the natives to understand how the farming community which once boasted of the best that nature can provide, now bears the sobriquet of all that is evil: killing, maiming, destruction, weeping and mourning for anyone who strays into Birnin Gwari and those who are frequently taken captives and dragged into the deep and expansive forests located in the area. Birnin Gwari has come to denote a centre of terror, fear and agony; not the serenity that it was meant to provide for men and women.\n\nEven owners of the land are also not spared as they have become easy preys for the ravenous predators who swarm the community as bandits and terrorists, brandishing sophisticated weapons that even the military is worried about. But they continue to dominate the space and time in the area, unleashing repeated atrocities in the area while those saddled with the responsibility to rid the forests of these evil elements appear helpless or impotent. Like trees planted by the waterside, the bandits continue to flourish and spread their tentacles across the land to the detriment and discomfort of the real owners of the land. Farmers, who should be using the fertile ground for producing more food have since been forced out of their farms and prevented from exploiting and harnessing other natural resources that abound richly in the community.\n\nIt is the deprivation, exploitation and destruction that have come to define Birnin Gwari in recent years, removing its once celebrated name from the right side of history, giving the owners of the rich land headache and stripping them of their natural resources and displacing the landowners into the streets as refugees. They did not bargain for any of these atrocities that now characterise Birnin Gwari. They are victims! And, as the community continues to be identified with killings and destruction and dreaded as a graveyard by those who should patronise it, and as many see it as a barren land dominated by disaster, the risk of extinction arising from dejection and loathing rises higher by the day.\n\nJust this week, the terrorists descended on a military base at Pole Wire in Birnin-Gwari, killing 17 soldiers and many other civilians in the process and brought negative attention to Kaduna State. As a result of unrelenting assaults by terrorists and kidnappers along the ever-busy Kaduna-Abuja Road via Birnin-Gwari, motorists and commuters have been forced to abandon the route. Anyone who dares to ply that route is considered an informant or someone on a suicide mission. The link road from Birnin-Gwari to Funtua and Gusau is also a death trap and effectively avoided. The Emir of Birnin Gwari, Malam Jibril Zubairu Mai Gwari has not relented in calling attention to the worsening insecurity in his domain. In 2021, the Emir was targeted for elimination when bandits emerged in front of vehicles they believed were conveying the royal father and blocking them with trunks and brandishing weapons to stop his convoy. But the monarch was not to be found and the drivers were lucky to escape the assassination attempt.\n\nMai Gwari had since then been crying consistently over the plight of the people in his emirate. He insists that the federal authorities should come to their rescue and rid the area of gunmen and their likes who have made the area so difficult and scary to live. As the Emir had said, the Brinin Gwari road is very strategic to Nigeria\u2019s economy because finished goods and raw materials are being transported through the road to and from other parts of the country. Although the Federal Government has continued to pledge that it will flush out the bandits, nothing has been done significantly to deal with the evil men who continue to grow in strength and atrocity. Apart from the deployment of a military unit in the area, which many believed facilitated the killing of a top bandit, known as Buharin Daji, no serious gain has been made thereafter. Shortly after the terrorist was killed, many other attacks have been launched successfully by the terrorists despite the deployment of the 271 Nigerian Air Force Detachment in Birnin Gwari as part of measures to address the spate of kidnapping and armed banditry in the local government area and its environs.\n\nRight now, incessant cases of cattle rustling, kidnappings for ransom, forced marriages and imposition of tax, among others, in Birnin Gwari by bandits have led to mass exodus of the natives, leaving the communities and forests at the mercy of terrorists who determine how the place should be run and operate, who should live and who should be eliminated. Lamentations over deteriorating security situation in Birnin Gwari continue to grow. A few days ago, the troubled community under the aegis of Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressive Union, BEPU, raised the alarm over the deteriorating security situation in many rural communities and major roads of the Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area.\n\nThey said although efforts were being made by the local government administration to tackle insecurity and support the Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, the state government and the Federal Government had not done enough to assist them in their agony. According to Ishan Usman Kasai, the Chairman of BEPU, the security situation is becoming increasingly alarming, whereby a large swathe of Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area is now at the mercy of marauding bandits who usually roll into towns and villages in convoys of motorcycles mostly riding three on each, brandishing AK-47 rifles killing and abducting people, including women and children.\n\n\u201cWe note that the bandits usually spend hours operating with impunity and unleashing terror especially in rural communities. The bandits also placed taxes on various communities and keep coming back repeatedly to attack them because of the absence of law enforcement agents,\u201d Kasai said. \u201cThis situation is not only tragic but shameful that these bunch of ragtag bandits on motorcycles wielding AK-47 rifles can roam most communities in the area with impunity, killing and abducting innocent but helpless citizens in a nation that seems to have standing Armed Forces and the Police.\u201d For now, the locals said the eastern part of Birnin-Gwari is fast becoming the headquarters of terrorists where bandits operate and govern unrestrained.\n\nThe bandits have carried out about five series of attacks in Tabanni Ward alone within just this week whereby many people were killed and dozens abducted. It is frightening that many communities in Birnin-Gwari LGA are falling in to the governance of bandits. Arewa Voice reports that the first attack on Tabanni within the week took place on March 15, 2022 where two people were abducted and one was killed on Dogon Dawa \u2013 Zaria Road. Similarly, on March 27, 2022, Old Tabanni was attacked whereby one man was killed and seven women abducted. On the same date, one man was killed in Kamfanin Mamman Yarwa of same Tabbanni ward.\n\nAnsaru terrorists gaining ground:\n\nOf great concern to the people is the activities of Ansaru terrorist organisation, whose members are said to have freely continued to operate, preach and recruit people into the organisation in various communities in the eastern part of Birnin-Gwari LGA such as Old Kuyello, Unguwan Makera, Kwasa-Kwasa, Damari, Kuduru forest, Ingade Alha and Maidaro. According to Kasai, killings and kidnappings in Birnin-Gwari LGA have become a daily affair more especially along major roads (particularly the Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna and Birnin-Gwari to Funtua roads). Moreover, the road from Dogon Dawa to Rigachikun was completely taken over by bandits. Kasai noted: \u201cPresently, Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna road is a no-transit area unless with security escort. Even with the escort, travelers are usually ambushed, kidnapped and killed in many occasions. This usually happens because the terrorists are more in number than the security escorts. There are many notorious flashpoints, especially along Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna roads where permanent security checkpoints need to be mounted in order to minimise the level of kidnappings and killings of travellers. These notorious flashpoints include Kwanar Bola, Kwanar Ruwa, Unguwar Yako, Polewire, Zonkoro, Zirin Gaza, Gonar Mangoro, Hawan Kwantena, Kwanar Mahaukaciya, Kwanar Giginya, Rafin Kaura, around Labi, Kwanan Dutse/around Manini, Tashar Tsuntsaye, Pollwaya, and Yadin Boroni among others.\n\n\u201cCurrently the major den of the kidnappers that operate along Birnin-Gwari to Kaduna road is around Falale (Demba) of Buruku forest. For the past four months, most of the ransom that has been paid was at that particular place. It is no longer news that millions is being paid to the bandits as ransom for freedom of kidnapped persons and taxes for access to farmlands and for freedom to live in various communities within the LGA. There are hundreds of captives including women and children who have being in the den of the bandits for months and are yet to be released because their families could not afford to pay for their freedom.\u201d\n\nOne of the most disturbing incidents is that of the kidnapped three young ladies, namely: Nusaiba, Rabi\u2019atu and Firdausi Lawal Ado. These teenagers are students of a College of Health who were abducted on their way from Kaduna to Birnin-Gwari for Christmas break since December, 2021 and are still in the den of kidnappers/bandits despite many efforts by the family and some well-meaning members of the community to secure their freedom.\n\nNo one knows the health conditions of those teenagers at present except the kidnappers. There is need for government to come to the aid of this traumatized family for these girls to regain their freedom.\n\nWith the series of attacks on most communities in Birnin-Gwari LGA, thousands of people are rendered internally displaced persons (IDPs) without proper organization and other necessary care from the Government. The entire Birnin-Gwari Emirate will continue to face existential threat unless something drastic and urgent is done by the military to counter the current state of affairs in Birnin Gwari, the once flourishing community with animals, food and passengers.",

The well-orchestrated incident remains highly condemnable, reprehensible and upsetting to every rational mind.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us, either within communities and/or on the roads we ply, have automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it. The humanity in us is slowly being eroded, thereby making us to adapt to the new normal within which we have unfortunately found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that in Islam, and by all global standards, the essence of government and governance is solely to protect the five principal cardinal rights of the human race, the most important of which is life! Any government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place; this is enunciated in Section 33(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have, however, carefully studied and followed up the unfortunate train blast, especially that another train attack was reported to have occurred on the Lagos-Kano-bound train, near Jaji, Kaduna State, on Thursday, March 31, 2022, which inevitably led to the death of the locomotive operator.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this press release is premised on the fact that Nigeria is more or less heading to an unknown destination of multiple cum well-coordinated serial chaos attributable to lack of coordination and synergy from security personnel, if the news making the rounds is to be believed\u2026\u201d\n\nIt expressed dismay that bandits have taken over some areas in the country where they collect taxes from their victims while government cannot take action.",

          "text": "The 2023 political process began in earnest on Friday, 25 February 2022 with the signing into law of the amended Electoral Act by President Muhammadu Buhari. The newly amended act is revolutionary because it allows for more independence by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). For instance, on the issue of electronic transmission of results, the Act leaves that to the discretion of INEC. Section 50 (2) prescribes that: \u201cSubject to Section 63 of this Act, voting at an election and transmission of results under this Act shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the commission.\u201d\n\nThe body language of the commission indicates that such transmission shall by electronic means. In a position paper it issued on the matter, INEC said: \u201cThe answer to the question of the desirability of electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria today may be summed up in three words \u2013 trust, efficiency and safety.\u201d The reason for this is not far-fetched. Results even though well carried out at the polling stage have been known to have been manipulated at the collation stage even when there is adequate documentation of the electoral process.\n\nBut most worthy of note in the new electoral act is a section which President Buhari had contended with, which had caused him to return a previous version of the electoral act for further deliberation. That section is Section 84 (2) which previously restricted the selection of aspirants by political parties to direct primaries. As is evident with the colour of the recently concluded All Progressives Congress (APC) convention, the president\u2019s predisposition is toward selecting aspirants by parties through consensus. This bias was now written into the clause which now read: \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or consensus.\u201d While consensus is arguably the most peaceful way of running party selections in such a volatile clime as ours, it removes the democratic element where each person\u2019s vote matters. But then, it can be argued that true democracy cannot be attained in one fell swoop.\n\nAgain, while consensus may work in the APC, where, because of the element of incumbency, might is right, such an arrangement is bound to fall flat within the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which is more prone to a rigorous, more free-for-all style of selection; more so, in Cross River State, which is anybody\u2019s game going forward. Or is it?\n\nCross River State\u2019s situation is interesting. There has been a laborious debate about which zone should produce the next governor. This debate is across both parties. The incumbent, Senator Benedict Ayade, is rounding off his administration, having almost completed his two terms. He belongs to the APC and is a strong advocate for power to go to the south. Because of his firm grip on the party, this may just be the way that things may go for APC, even though it has been gathered that some stalwarts in the Central Senatorial District want to tip the apple cart by coming out to declare. Only time would tell.\n\nIn the Cross River State PDP, there is a freer disposition of aspirators. Long before the official bell was sounded, candidates from Central Senatorial District had declared their intention to vie for the gubernatorial seat. This produced some discomfort within the southern caucus of the party, which, citing a previous agreement, averred that the next governor should indeed come from the south. Many meetings had been held to resolve this imbroglio to no end. In the end, it has been implicitly accepted that the race is open to any aspirant, no matter the geographical base.\n\nThe race within the APC seems to be a three-way race. From a dipstick poll, it is evident that the front-runners are Senator Bassey Otu, Arc. Bassey Ndem and Asuquo Ekpenyong, present Commissioner for Finance. There is Ben Akak, a dark horse who may spring some surprise. It is possible that given the national flavour of the APC, the eventual CRS gubernatorial candidate from the party will be thrown up by a consensus arrangement.\n\nThe race in the PDP is more rigorous with Senator Gershom Bassey leading the pack, closely marked by Senator Sandy Onor, and Dan Asuquo (popularly known as DanSuki) coming as a third option. The selection is bound to be Indirect Primaries. Here, delegates to the State Congress of the party where the primaries will be carried out would be selected at the Ward Congress level. The selection process is rigorous but democratic.\n\nWhat are the permutations for the election of the eventual Cross River State governor in 2023? Let us bear in mind that despite his defection to the APC, Cross River State is still a PDP state, the events of the last by-elections in the north, notwithstanding. So, it can be surmised that the race is clearly between Ayade and the PDP. On their own, the APC aspirants lack the individual clout to upset the juggernauts in the PDP. That is a fact.\n\nSenator Bassey Otu was defeated twice in 2015 and 2019 by Senator Gershom Bassey, who is the current senator representing the Southern Senatorial District. It is doubtful if Otu can overturn the series of defeats now that he has weakened his southern base by going to APC. In a two-way race, Gershom Bassey will take Central Senatorial District. Because of the Ayade factor in the North, Otu will be fortunate there. Gershom Bassey of PDP will ultimately be the winner.\n\nBut against, Sandy Onor, Otu will be luckier. He will take the South and the North and lose the Central. It will be an electoral skirmish, but Otu does have the chance to be the next Cross River State governor here.\n\nA two-way race between Otu and DanSuki will see a dog fight in the South \u2013 a possible 50-50. Otu may take Central and the North. Otu will be the winner against a DanSuki.\n\nBassey Ndem, a brilliant architect and entrepreneur, is new to the political field. But against the candidates from the PDP, he will lose in all the senatorial districts except, perhaps, the North. In a two-way race against the PDP candidates, he does not stand a chance.\n\nAnother neophyte, Asuquo Ekpenyong is the current Commissioner for Finance. He is touted as Ayade\u2019s preferred candidate. He has yet to declare his aspirations but may emerge by consensus. By just like Ndem, he is bound to lose all the zones, except, perhaps, the North.\n\nThe permutations against the APC candidates may cause Ayade to run a very aggressive political rally against the PDP. He has so much at stake. This is a battle for survival for him in a very personal way. A loss by APC will be a very great loss for him. It is only left to conjecture as to why he must fight the fight of his life. His situation is even more precarious, given the legal battle that he is embroiled in concerning his defection from the PDP.\n\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that Senator Gershom Bassey is PDP\u2019s best foot forward. A Bassey win is vital for the PDP to regain control of the affairs of Cross River State. But he faces a determined adversary, Senator Benedict Ayade. The election is Senator Gershom Bassey\u2019s to lose.",

          "text": "I\u2019m waiting for anyone to sue over Omisore, says Soyinka\n\nNobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has insisted that the National Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Otunba Iyiola Omisore, is not fit for the position for disgracing former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, the late Chief Bola Ige.\n\nSoyinka spoke at a media parley with the theme: Forget the Past, Forfeit the Future: A Nation Seceding from Humanity, yesterday in Lagos.\n\nThe literary icon said he was ready for anyone who might want to challenge him on his position concerning Omisore.\n\n\u201cThose who want to go to court should proceed. I am waiting. There is a lot more to be unearthed,\u201d he said.\n\nSounding figurative, Soyinka said: \u201cIf the ruling party wants Omisore, they should make him an ambassador, probably to Ukraine. Don\u2019t make him the National Secretary of ruling party. That\u2019s our concern.\n\n\u201cSomeone who was guilty of attacking the Minister of Justice in the palace of a spiritual head of a group of people is not fit to be seen as National Secretary of a ruling party.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt about Omisore being erudite. He is knowledgeable about certain things. When you remove the cap of a man, in Yoruba culture, he knows the meaning.\n\n\u201cThat action of disgracing and humiliating Bola Ige, a respected chief, disqualifies him from that position. I ask APC leadership to have a rethink. This issue will not go away.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel laureate indicted the leadership of APC for giving such an exalted position to Omisore.\n\n\u201cIt is a collective guilt on the leadership of APC that you have to unleash scorpions on our memories. Wole Soyinka didn\u2019t provoke the situation, it is those who were so insensitive, callous and calculating to rub that on our faces,\u201d he said.\n\nSoyinka urged President Muhammadu Buhari to fulfill his electoral promise by reopening the files of unresolved assassinations in the country.\n\nHe said justice must be served, not only on the case of Ige, but also on Dele Giwa, Kudirat Abiola, Aminasoari Dikibo, Harry Marshall, among others.\n\nSoyinka noted that the enthronement of violence and impunity has led to the debasement of values and elevation of the atrocities committed by terrorists.\n\nThe Nobel laureate urged the government to seek international assistance on insecurity rather than go for mercenaries, as suggested by Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cWe are overqualified for international assistance. We have reached the end of our tether. Let\u2019s seek foreign assistance. Nigeria has become a slave depot. Let\u2019s stop relying on our empty pride and tell the international community we need help,\u201d he added.\n\nSoyinka, who also recalled how he was robbed in Lagos and his Abeokuta home, said despite police investigation into the matter, nothing was heard again on the matter.\n\nOn the Opon Imo issue, Soyinka said: \u201cI didn\u2019t invent it. I went there because I believe in localising technology. Some people complained to me it was their idea, and not that of Osun State.\u201d\n\nActivist-lawyer Femi Falana (SAN) urged the government to ensure that the killers of Bola Ige are brought to justice.\n\nThe eminent lawyer recalled that the Chukwudifu Oputa panel recommended that the cases of unresolved assassinations should be reopened, citing the case of Kudirat Abiola and others.\n\n\u201cOnce killers involved in murder have not been found, you don\u2019t close the case. It is called cold killings in the U.S. Cases are reopened regularly. There is nothing wrong in reminding Buhari of the murder cases,\u201d he",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nRevenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) has proposed a 3.33 per cent reduction in the statutory allocation to the Federal Government, while it increased those of states and local government councils by 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent respectively.\n\nThe new adjustments to the revenue allocation formula due to the federating units are contained in a report presented, yesterday, to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, by RMAFC Chairman, Elias Mbam.\n\nIn the new RMAFC proposal, the Federal Government, which previously received 52.68 per cent of the allocation, would now get 45.17 per cent, while states would take 29.79 per cent as against the previous 26.72 per cent. Councils will now be allocated 21.04 per cent as against their previous 20.60 per cent.\n\nWith regards to the Special Funds, RMAFC proposed an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for the development of natural resources.\n\nA statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, quoted Buhari as saying after receiving the report, he would await the outcome of the ongoing constitutional review process before presenting the report of the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, I would have gone ahead to table this report before the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment. However, since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula is a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, I will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe president said for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of government.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe listed some of the proposed amendments in the report to include, the establishment of local government as a tier of government and abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports, fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\n\nThe president assured members of the commission that the Federal Government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalisation of the efforts by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said this strategy, rather than issuing an executive modification order, as was done in 1992, was more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHe commended RMAFC for a job painstakingly done, pledging his unwavering commitment and support to them in carrying out their constitutional mandates.\n\nThe president also thanked Nigerians, especially states and local governments, for making their inputs through the broad stakeholder engagement processes that produced the report.\n\n\u201cI am aware the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992.\n\n\u201cConsidering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as privatisation, deregulation, funding arrangement of primary education, primary health care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our revenue sharing formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government. This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said, as an advocate of grassroots development, he has always remained committed to ensuring all tiers of government are treated fairly, equally and justly in the sharing of national resources.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said RMAFC followed due process in undertaking the exercise, and sought the opinion of the Federal Government before finalising the report.\n\nMbam said since the last review was conducted in 1992, about 29 years ago, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional states in 1996, which brought the number of states to 36.\n\nCorrespondingly, he said, the number of local governments also increased from 589 to 774.\n\nHe said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided \u201cby the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\u201d",

He said this would ensure speedy trial of culprits.\n\nThe GMD, who blamed the drop in the country\u2019s daily crude oil production on the activities of oil thieves and pipeline vandals, said they must be tackled seriously in view of the danger their activities are posing to the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom January till date, we lost an average of 250,000 barrel per day and at the current price of about 100 dollars to the barrel, even within this short period, we have lost close to 1.5 billion dollars. This led to decline in production from the Bonny terminal. In January 2021, we were producing 239,000 barrel from the line linking Bonny terminal and we only receive 190,000 barrel meaning that we lost about 19,000 barrel to thieves then per day.\n\n\u201cThis situation deteriorated to the extent that by March 7, 2022, it came to zero and so, we shut down the line and declared \u2018force Majeur\u2019.

          "title": "Zenith Shareholders Reap Bumper Harvest as Bank Pays N97.3bn Dividend",
          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\n\n\n\n\nShareholders of Zenith Bank Plc have unanimously approved the bank\u2019s proposed final dividend, expressing delight at the final dividend payment of N2.80 per share which brings the total payout for the 2021 financial year to N3.10 per share with a total value of N97.33 billion.\n\nThe shareholders gave the approval at the bank\u2019s 31st Annual General Meeting (AGM) held yesterday at Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nIn his statement, the Founder and Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr Jim Ovia, thanked the shareholders for their unflinching loyalty, which has enabled the bank to rise to the pinnacle of the nation\u2019s financial services industry, and assured them of the bank\u2019s commitment to consistently deliver superior value to them.\n\nSpeaking on the financial institution\u2019s performance, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said: \u201cif you look at the bank\u2019s history over the years, Zenith Bank has always grown, and even within the pandemic, we have maintained a reasonable positive growth trajectory. Growth is coming from the fact that we are deploying our digital capability to grow more businesses, simplify our service processes, make our processes more efficient, and deal with customers\u2019 complaints.\n\n\u201cApart from developing new products, we are discovering new business verticals, especially within the retail segment, which have significant revenue.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMeeting the expectation of shareholders means we have to work harder. The team is dodged, hardworking, resilient, and above all, we have a very supportive board that comes with superior guidance.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the dividend payout, the Chairman Emeritus of the Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Mr. Sunny Nwosu, expressed the delight of shareholders over the consistent payment of dividends by Zenith Bank, noting that the bank\u2019s shares remain the toast of investors because the bank has never failed to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\nAlso speaking on behalf of other shareholders, the President of the Association of the Rights of Nigerian Shareholders (AARNS), Dr. Faruk Umar, said: \u201cThe bank is doing very well. All the ratios and indices have gone up. And more importantly, while we were in the meeting, I got my alert of the credit of my dividend. This is very commendable.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the bank has been very effective; we thank Jim Ovia for the leadership he has been giving, he has increased the dividend in spite of the economic hardship in the country, and I believe the GMD is doing very well. I commend the management and staff of the bank, including the board, and I am very confident that this year would also be very good for the bank.\u201d\n\nUmar also commended the Group Managing Director over the numerous awards the bank received in 2021, especially the sustainability awards.\n\nIn spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Zenith Bank Group achieved year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings of 10 per cent from the N696.5 billion reported in the previous year to N765.6 billion. This was on the back of a 23 per cent YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7 billion to N309 billion and a two per cent YoY growth in interest income from N420.8 billion to N427.6 billion.\n\nIts profit before tax also grew by 10 per cent, from N255.9 billion to N280.4 billion in the current year. The increase was due to growth in the top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12 per cent from N121.1 billion in 2020, to N106.8 billion in the current year.\n\nThis further led to a seven per cent increase in net interest income of N320.8 billion in 2021, from N299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nThe bank\u2019s customer deposits also increased by 21 per cent, growing from N5.34 trillion in the previous year to N6.47 trillion in the current year.\n\nThe growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. Retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the current year. Although operating expenses grew by 13 per cent YoY, growth remains below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by six per cent from N7.34 to N7.78.\n\nTotal assets increased by 11 per cent, growing from N8.48 trillion in 2020 to N9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits. With the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group prudently grew its gross loans by 20 per cent, from N2.9 trillion in 2020 to N3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio from 4.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent YoY. The Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6 per cent and 21 per cent, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. Also, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Decision makes Oyo, Delta, Rivers, Cross River, Abia, Enugu, Akwa Ibom vulnerable in govship contest, Benue also susceptible\n\n\u2022Party unlikely to make appreciable impact in key northern states to compensate for loss in south\n\n\u2022Ortom: We\u2019re yet to throw our ticket open\n\n\u2022Ohanaeze, PANDEF condemn decision by opposition party, say it\u2019s suicidal, a betrayal\n\n\u2022Fayose: PDP must tread carefully over zoning\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu, Emameh Gabriel in Abuja, Emma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the decision by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to throw its 2023 presidential ticket open, has not been sealed yet by its National Executive Committee (NEC), there are clear indications the party might compromise its otherwise bright chances in next year\u2019s general election if it travelled that route.\n\nSome of the unintended consequences of such a critical, but sensitive decision, is that the PDP might render some of its key states vulnerable and further unable to make significant impact in a few other equally crucial states, in addition to frittering away the presidency.\n\nTherefore, while the decision could make the PDP lose such states like Oyo, Delta, Rivers, Abia, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Benue and Cross River (though currently controlled by the APC, however, a strong PDP state) in the governorship election.\n\nEven more interesting is that the action does not guarantee the PDP would make any major impact in key northern states to compensate for the expected loss in the south.\n\nFor example, the PDP has never won Yobe and Borno States, and it is unlikely to perform any magic in 2023, to change the voting pattern. So, the party would face an uphill task winning these states even with a northern presidential candidate and the APC fielding a southern candidate.\n\nThis, nonetheless, Chairman of the PDP Zoning Committee and Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, yesterday, denied the claim, stating that the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) would take a final decision on whether or not to throw the presidential ticket open.\n\nAlso, reactions to throwing the contest open to all came swiftly from several groups in the South, who have been clamouring for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the South.\n\nForemost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, condemned the decision by the PDP to throw its presidential ticket open, saying it was a suicidal move.\n\nA Pan-Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF), has also expressed its disappointment at the PDP decision, saying it was an awful decision that would have consequences.\n\nA preponderance of submissions by analysts contended that if the party eventually produced a northern presidential candidate, it stood the chance of losing those southern states to the All Progressives Congress (APC), especially, that it had already begun to make inroads into the southern states.\n\nUnfortunately, the possibility that PDP might pick its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election from the North is high, because the north, which has more delegates would ensure that a northerner emerged at its presidential primaries.\n\nYet, with a northern presidential candidate, the PDP might lose some of its controlled states in the South-south, Southeast and at the same time, unable to make serious impacts in some APC-controlled northern states, both at the governorship and presidential polls.\n\nA survey report sighted by THISDAY, which advised against throwing the ticket open, alluded to the agitation and position of the southern governors that the next president should come from their region.\n\nThe party would be going against the mood of its support zone, if it fields a northerner. According to analysts, \u201cthere is no way the party will escape the wrath of the of the South\u201d, if it goes ahead to pick a northerner as its candidate.\n\nAccording to the survey, the PDP states had already complained of the implications of being in opposition by 2023, and cited the frequent defections of some of their governors and members of the National Assembly to the APC, as a development that could not be glossed over.\n\nThe survey, therefore, warned that the PDP might lose governorship elections in Delta, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Oyo states, because it might lose grip of the attendant protests for a southern presidential candidate.\n\nWhile the survey report stated that the party might win in Adamawa state, it noted unequivocally that it would be unable to make any positive input in Borno and Yobe States, as it has never won elections in the two north east states\n\nImportantly, with the resignation of Rabiu Kwankwanso from the PDP and his membership of a relatively unknown New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP), the PDP might not make any positive impact in Kano State.\n\nThe survey further analysed that, should the APC also pick a southern presidential candidate, it would take advantage of the whirlwind protests against the PDP, which is determined to go north.\n\nThe report reiterated that only Adamawa State might be retained by the PDP in the north as 2023 would be a smooth-sail victory for the APC.\n\nWhereas the southern states of Delta, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Benue in the north central might be taken over by the APC, because of the solidarity of the ruling party picking a southern presidential candidate, in tune with the mood of the nation.\n\nA copy of the recommendation of the zoning committee obtained by THISDAY stated thus: \u201cZoning, as in our party constitution, is affirmed. Inspite of (1) above, ticket is thrown open, this time around due to exigency of time. Our party is encouraged to always make the issue of zoning very clear, at least, six months before sales of forms.\n\n\u201cOur party should commend the efforts of some our contestants on the issue of consensus candidacy; the efforts should be seen to a peaceful and logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nBut no date has been fixed for the National Executive Committee (NEC) the party, where it is expected to ratify the recommendation.\n\nTo that extent, the survey report sighted by THISDAY, stated that there would be a mark up in the 2015 and 2019 election figures for the APC in the South, due to the fact that the party would field a presidential candidate from South, giving value to the aspirations of the people of the South.\n\nVerified INEC Figures of 2019 Election\n\nA verified INEC figures of the 2019 election, put registered voters as follows: North West:20 million; South West: 15.8 million; North Central: 13.1 million; South-south: 12.6 million; North East: 11.3 million and South East: 9.5 million, put the total for northern Nigeria at 44.3 million and Southern Nigeria at 38 million.\n\nAlso, it stated that, 35 in every 100 Nigerian that registered to vote in 2019 presidential election, voted. Thus, in Northern Nigeria, the figure was 41, while the Southern Nigeria posted 27.\n\nThe figures for the turnout also broke down the election categories as follow: Presidential Election: North West, 44%; North East, 43%; North Central, 37%; South-south, 28%; South West, 28%, and South East, 25%. Over all, the Northern Nigeria had 41% while the Southern Nigeria had 27%.\n\nHighest Voting States\n\nA breakdown of the 2019 highest voting states listed the top 10. Kano: NW, 1.96; Kaduna: NW, 1.71m; Katsina: NW, 1.62m; Lagos: SW, 1.16m; Jigawa: NW, 1.15m; Plateau: NC,1.06m; Bauchi: NE, 1.06m; Borno, NE, 955K; Sokoto: NW, 926K and Niger: NC, 897K.\n\nYet, the 2019 least voting states, according to the survey, gave the breakdown. On the presidential election, Bayelsa: SS, 336K; Abia: SE, 344K; Ebonyi: SE, 379K; Ekiti: SW,394K; Cross River: SS, 446K; Enugu: SE, 451K; FCT: NC, 451K; Kwara: NC, 486K; Imo: SE, 543K; and Kogi: NC, 553K.\n\nFactors That Informed the THISDAY Projections\n\nClearly, these are not some armchair analyses but informed by existential factors, which point in plausible directions for the different categories of elections. However, in the presidential run, there are three critical factors that currently lent credence to the THISDAY projections.\n\nThe first factor is that the APC is still strong in the north despite insecurity and banditry. This is essentially, because they still have the support of three key religious groups in the north.\n\nThe groups include the one led by Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi. There\u2019s another led by Muhammad Sanusi II, former emir of Kano, the Tijaniyya Islamic sect, and of course, there is the Izala Muslim sect, formally Jama\u2019at Izalatul. They have continued to mobilise support for the APC and so, it is still very strong in the north.\n\nThe second factor is that, even if the PDP fielded a northern candidate, it still couldn\u2019t defeat the APC in the north and at the same time, it would lose in the south, because APC would still retain its northern hold, while the PDP would lose the south.\n\nHowever, the third factor is the mood of the country. In 1999, the mood of the country was for a South-west candidate, because of the June 12 crisis, which also explained why the two presidential candidates at the time \u2013 Olusegun Obasanjo and Oluyemisi Falae \u2013 were from the zone.\n\nIn 2011, the mood was for Niger Delta, albeit by providence, and former President Goodluck Jonathan, won. And now, the mood is for a southern candidate, however, from the Southeast zone.\n\nAbove all, the second term APC governors are also determined to ensure successors of choice, a development that would make the election stiff and clearly in their favour with the incumbency factor largely in force.\n\nOrtom: Ticket Not Open Yet, NEC Will Take Final Decision\n\nChairman of the PDP Zoning Committee and Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has denied claim that the party had thrown its ticket open, saying a final decision on the matter would be taken by the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nOrtom said members of the committee met, and unanimously adopted a position, but concluded not to make the decision public until NEC makes a final pronouncement on it.\n\nOrtom, who spoke on the ARISE NEWS Channel, stressed that what was decided at the meeting would be subject to NEC\u2019s approval, adding that NEC could either decide in agreement with what they did, or decide to subtract or add to it.\n\n\u201cAll that we did was a recommendation and that was why we felt that it was premature for us to let the cat out of the bag. PDP has not brought out a report, and that will be done by NEC, so don\u2019t crucify us.\n\n\u201cThey will soon invite us to a meeting, a decision will be taken and then, we can move on from there. NEC has the final authority to decide the zoning. So, when that decision is made, then, the party will give a directive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, however, said the committee\u2019s work at their own level had been concluded and the report submitted to NEC to decide on what they thought was best for the party at the material time.\n\n\u201cWe are just 37 members selected from each state and the Federal Capital Territory. But I want to tell you, that PDP is very mindful. We listen to the people, because we are a grassroots party; we are people-oriented and will make sure that whatever we do reflects the interests of our people in the PDP and for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTwo heads are better than one and we have been able to send a recommendation to NEC. They will make a final decision and I think we will soon be invited for a meeting, because in any case, most of the members of the committee happen to be members of NEC. So, there will be a robust discussion on what will help Nigeria and our party to win in 2023,\u201d Ortom further said.\n\nInterestingly, he made his position known to all on the zoning, when he said the presidency should be zoned to the south, adding that zoning was part of PDP\u2019s constitution and they were able to resolve what they thought was best for the party, adding that, this was his personal position right from the beginning.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am not talking as a zoning committee member or the chairman of zoning committee; I am talking as Samuel Ortom. Most importantly, what can we do to get back to where we stopped in 2015, because Nigerians were aware of how PDP was able to manage the economy, the security, the social life, and everything?\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have already gone from top to bottom and we\u2019re not just talking at the bottom, we are going beneath the bottom, if no drastic action is taken with someone with the capacity to deliver. It means all of us are going to be buried soon.\n\n\u201cFor some of us, we have made sacrifices. The unity of Nigeria cannot be compromised and I\u2019m ready to sacrifice anything to ensure justice, equity, and fairness, for our people,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nReacting to accusations that some aspirants were trying to use money to get the ticket, he said people are entitled to their opinions but encouraged Nigerians to always seek the truth, even as he urged everybody to team up in the fight for justice, equity and fairness in everything, knowing that this is a democratic rule.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are really looking at the larger picture of winning the election. It is not just about having a candidate, but it is about going ahead campaigning and winning the election so that we can rescue Nigeria and build it, which is our paramount interest as at now.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairman explained that PDP\u2019s NEC had always been represented by all members of the party in the entire country from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), adding that other people from outside, who were not members of NEC could still make input.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to get it right. PDP got it wrong in 2015 and they paid dearly for it. I am sure our people have learnt from the mistakes that were done in the past and that is why you can see we are not talking about imposition of candidates. We are talking about doing due process in ensuring that democracy gets to the grassroots and the people themselves, have a say, who becomes their representative.\n\n\u201cSo, the issue of money is not the focus. In 2015, there was money everywhere, but did PDP win? Today, we are focusing on assuring that we get the hearts of the people and I believe that in doing this, we must ensure justice, fairness, equity and truthfulness, in all that we do,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nThe Benue governor also accused the present administration of rigging in past elections, stating that from the information that they had been able to gather, the opposition has plans to still rig in futute elections, but said PDP would not allow such to happen again.\n\nHe reiterated that the reason he was banned from seeing President Muhammadu Buhari was because he was advising him to do the right thing.\n\n\u201cThe government does not have the interest of the people. They only have their own personal interest. If the federal government does not act fast, Nigeria will be buried and that is where we are headed,\u201d Ortom added.\n\nOhanaeze: Throwing Presidential Ticket Open is Political Betrayal\n\nA foremost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has condemned the decision by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to throw its presidential ticket open to aspirants from all parts of the country and described it as political betrayal.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the group, which urged all the Igbo presidential aspirants to remain focused and undounted, wondered why the party decided to jettison zoning now that it was the turn of the South, particularly, the South East.\n\n\u201cFor purpose of clarity, rotation and zoning principle was engrained into the PDP party\u2019s Constitution in 2009. Article 7 (2) (c) of the PDP Constitution states: \u2018In pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness, the party shall adhere to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices, and it shall be enforced by the appropriate executive committee at all levels,\u201d Ohanaeze explained.\n\nThe group noted that such \u201cunscrupulous violation of the zoning principle that has been well entrenched in the PDP constitution simply changes the rules of the game in order to deprive Ndigbo the opportunity to produce a president for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt claimed it was a political blunder and betrayal, given what Ndigbo had suffered in the country and most recently, for supporting the PDP.\n\n\u201cHistory has never been kind to betrayers and the treacherous,\u201d Ohanaeze said, stressing that, \u201cThe machinations and conspiracies to deny Ndigbo their due place in Nigeria is an ingratitude that daily cries to God.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze reiterated the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark, that any party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect the support of the Middle Belt and the entire South.\n\nThe organisation maintained that one of the roles of a political party in a democracy was nation building and that for the PDP to shirk its responsibilities, was an unfortunate path to Golgotha.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cLet it be known that it runs contrary to the indomitable Igbo spirit to swallow any form of indignity, disdain or condescension from anybody or group. It is, therefore, highly inconceivable that the Igbo will validate a party or group that runs roughshod over its sensibilities,\u201d Ohanaeze said.\n\nPANDEF: PDP\u2019s Decision is Awful, Will Have Consequences\n\nA Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), yesterday, expressed its disappointment in the decision of the PDP to throw its 2023 presidential ticket open, warning that such an awful decision would have consequences.\n\nThe Forum, in a release by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, stated that it was not utterly surprised at the development, as the outcome was predictable, because there were evident pointers that this would be the conclusion.\n\nPANDEF insisted that for fairness, equity, justice and in the nation\u2019s interest, the next President of Nigeria, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, should come from the South.\n\nIt reiterated the call by the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) on the people and all lovers of peace and equity in Nigeria to reject any political party that failed to zone its presidential ticket to the South.\n\nThe statement stated, although in parts, \u201cGovernor Ortom\u2019s Committee had a script and they have played it out, with due deference to some patriots that were in the Committee. The level of desperation and political debauchery being demonstrated by some political stakeholders is deplorable and quite disappointing.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we are in a society, where it seems anything goes. We will await the conduct of the presidential primaries by the parties to assess the choices that would be presented to us. Anything otherwise would be detrimental to national peace and cohesion. The basis of any viable democracy, especially, in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, is fairness and even sharing of power.\u201d\n\nFrom PDP\u2019s Zoning Committee, Some Inside Gist\n\nBefore the PDP zooming committee meeting commenced yesterday, it was observed that Professors ABC Nwosu and Jerry Gana, had in collaboration with like minds, drafted what they purported to represent the views of the committee at the previous meeting.\n\nThis was revealed to the meeting by the Deputy Chairman of the Committee and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon Ndudi Elumelu.\n\nHowever, to the rude shock of some members, Elumelu got up and wanted to present what he claimed was the draft resolution of the committee for adoption.\n\nHe was angrily shouted down by some committee members from the South. Someone would later query why Nwosu and Gana hijacked the duty and responsibility of the committee\u2019s secretariat to summarise their contributions and went ahead to draft resolutions for them.\n\nAt this juncture, Governor Samuel Ortom took the microphone from him and started pleading with the house for calm and understanding.\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, was obliged to make contributions and he spoke along the line of the decisions of his colleague, Ortom, on the challenges facing the PDP as opposition party as well as the expectations and opportunities for the party to seize.\n\nThereafter, the Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, who was visibly angry, made reference to the submission of Bode George on the need for equity, fairness and justice to be reflected in all that the PDP would come out with.\n\nBut it was Senator Jonah Jang, a former Governor of Plateau State, who took strong exceptions to the attitude of his colleagues and queried the justification and morality in what they were saying.\n\nHe bluntly told everyone that what they are about to do by denying the South East Zone their God-given opportunity at this time of national distress to step in and rescue Nigeria was an act of hatred, cruel and unjust.\n\nIbrahim Shema, former Governor of Katsina State, was unapologetic in his submission and quoted various sections of the PDP Constitution to support his position and insistence on Rotation and Zoning.\n\nAs a former Deputy Chairman of the PDP, he counselled the committee to adopt the strategies of the past in cases like this, rotate and zone as per the PDP Constitution. He claimed that would not preclude those opposed to it from contesting, because it was their constitutional right, and by so doing, the party would have upheld its constitution.\n\nIn the midst of grumbling, Nze Ozichukwu Chukwu, whose brilliant and explosive memorandum, had been earlier circulated took the microphone and made a very moving speech that provoked an outcry at the meeting.\n\nHe challenged their minds with incidences, facts and figures while buttressing and reinforcing the submission of Governor Shema. He equally reminded all of the need for justness and sincerity. He spoke of the need to reinterpret the paper of Professors ABC Nwosu and Jerry Gana into ordinary language for them to become effective instruments for action.\n\nHow efficient will they be? To whose benefits? He queried. He went further to caution the PDP not to take the \u201csensitivities and sensibilities of the masses\u201d for granted and insisted that rotation and zoning were the pillars on which the PDP was anchored and what would happen in the event that the PDP jettisoned it and APC dusted it and embraced it.\n\nAt this point, Ortom asked him, \u201cPlease, what do you want us to do?\u201d He responded and said, \u201cYour Excellency, please, let us do right things right and zone the presidency to the South.\u201d\n\nAt this juncture there was an uproar. Alhaji Sule Lamido spoke but the eruption that attended Nze Ozichukwu\u2019s bombshell drowned his voice. To those who became quite uncomfortable and apprehensive, he cited the \u201cneed to diligently and sincerely cultivate the civilisation of dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe overheard him telling the chairman that as a democrat, he will sign the draft resolution not as a consensus document, but as reflecting majority opinion though no voting by raising of hands took place but he heard the voice votes.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting, we wanted to seek audience with Nze Ozichukwu for more light but he disappeared. By the time we went out looking for him, we were told that he had driven out with his driver,\u201d a source who was at the meeting.\n\nFayose: PDP Must Tread Carefully over Zoning\n\nA former governor of Ekiti State and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, Ayodele Fayose, has advised the opposition party to tread with caution and respect the existing zoning arrangement between the South and the North.\n\nHe also maintained that he was not going to step down for aspirants from any zone, because the sentiment that only the north could win election for the party must be jettisoned.\n\nThe former governor, who was a host on a Channels TV programme, Politics Today, a few hours after purchasing his presidential nomination form, said he was ready for the onslaught.\n\nFayose said he intentionally bought his nomination form to challenge the status quo and fight some powerful forces in the party, who wanted to silence or shortchange the south in the scheme of things.\n\n\u201cNigeria as a country has a diversity. And for that reason, we (PDP) must tread carefully. We must be very careful. The peculiarities, including the minority, the south, the north the middle belt and sentiment of religion for us to coexist brought into the fore to create within our constitution that there should be time to the north and there should be a time to the south.\n\n\u201cIf you remember what happened in 1999, what brought President Obasanjo to power was the reason of grievances in the south, because they don\u2019t have good time during the military.\n\n\u201cThe agitation was so much and the killing of Abiola and all that, was what brought President Obasanjo. I remember in 1999, power was purposely zoned to the Southwest that gave Olu Falae and Obasanjo the opportunity. There was no other way.\n\nExplaining why qualified aspirants from the South were not allowed to contest at the party\u2019s last convention in Port Harcourt, he said they \u201cdidn\u2019t contest because they were told it was purely a Northern affair\u2019. I was told it was going to be a Northern affairs. And that was why you ad the Sarakis of this world, the Atiku, the Tambuwal and all of them. There was no southerner,\u201d he recounted.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf we don\u2019t begin to put things in perspective and rightfully, our children will ask questions. The unfortunate demise of former President Yar\u2019Adua is not enough an excuse for anybody to take away the letters of our constitution.\n\n\u201cDo we say if you contest an election and you lost, they (the north) must continue to produce you so that you win before zoning will count? No! The last election has given opportunity to the north. If they had won that election, they would be there today. I don\u2019t believe in not zoning this presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nHe said the zoning committee of the party, which he was a member made an error for failing to specially state where it would pick its next presidential flag bearer from.\n\n\u201cI believe it was an error. It was wrong. It was the more reason why I took my form today. I won\u2019t be blamed for that. They would come back and say to us one day.\n\n\u201cLook at it from this angle. Who tells you that it\u2019s the north that will give us the vote? Some people say it and I hear it: \u2018let the person that can win.\u2019 Who can win? Who tell you that I cannot win?\n\n\u201cEverybody on election day would hold his ward and his local government. We will all work together, even after primaries. We have to come together and work for whoever wins an election. Stop telling me it\u2019s this person that can win. We are all great politicians in our states. We all donate our votes.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Fayose said, \u201cLet me give you an example. Let me come from our respectable leader, His Excellency Atiku Abubakar. He won in Adamawa by less than 20,000 votes. Less than, with due respect to him, for reasons of analysis. Go to Sokoto, what is the voting difference?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s us go to Bukola Saraki in Kwara, we actually lost there. Let\u2019s us sit back and look at figures. When somebody is saying this is the person that can win. Who is the person that can win? Let\u2019s talk about the characters. If we don\u2019t agree, we go to the field. We are not like the APC, where somebody will be begging you in the field.\n\n\u201cI am not stepping down. I am a young man, only 62. I won\u2019t step down. The energy is there. The party cannot determine consensus. Let me tell you the truth, it\u2019s within my right to contest an election. Even if they choose Governor Wike, I will still contest.\n\n\u201cLet all of us go to the field. It\u2019s this issue of consensus, that you try to turn red to green and trying to silence some people. This one, I purposely went there to get this form and I will start to go to states to let them know I am prepared for the onslaught.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Global payments company Visa has opened a new Innovation Studio in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe studio was officially opened by the Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, Dr Patrick Njoroge on April 6, at an event attended by leading banks, financial technology companies and innovation specialists from across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThis facility will serve the sub-Saharan Africa region and joins a network of innovation centers operated by Visa since 2016, in cities including London, Dubai and Singapore. The Nairobi studio is the first in Africa and sixth globally.\n\nThe new facility supports Visa\u2019s commitment to promoting innovation and creating opportunities for clients and fintech partners to co-create market-relevant payment and commerce solutions throughout the region.\n\nAida Diarra, Senior vice president and head of Visa in Sub-Saharan Africa, said the studio will assist in increasing the Visa market in the region by issuing digital and physical Visa to its clients.\n\n\u201cSub-Saharan Africa is a fast-growing region with a tech-savvy population and as we continue to grow digital payments adoption in the region, our aspiration is to deepen our collaboration with clients and partners in developing solutions that are designed around the unique needs of Africa,\u201d said Diarra.\n\n\u201cAs a brand built on technology, Visa has driven the major technology advancements that make electronic payments what they are today. We are confident that the innovation studio will continue that legacy and cement Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s position as a leader in creating out-of-the-box solutions to deal with our most pressing challenges as a region.\u201d\n\nVisa has previously used its existing innovation hubs to design products for the African market, including a collaboration with Nigerian Fintech Paga to develop new merchant acceptance solutions involving QR codes and NFC technology.\n\nLast year, Visa partnered with Kenya\u2019s largest telco Safaricom to allow M-Pesa\u2019s 24 million users and 173,000 local merchants to be linked to Visa\u2019s 61 million merchants and its more than 3 billion cards.\n\nAcross Africa, local and multinational corporations, as well as governments, have been launching innovation centres as a means to develop new products through collaborations and to remain globally competitive.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 4, 2022, after nine deadline extensions, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government directed all telcos to block Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards that have not been linked National Identity Numbers (NIN) from making outgoing calls. A decision that seems to have spurred Nigerians into action.\n\nAt the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters, Alausa, Lagos State, today, April 7, 2022, a crowd gathered at the gate, with problems ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. However, it appears that a larger number were there to enrol for their NINs.\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) ordered all mobile subscribers to link their NINs to their SIM cards. People without NINs were to quickly register or risk being blocked by December 30, 2021.\n\nA decision that seemed questionable, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have your NIN, linking your SIM to your NIN is relatively seamless and can be done by dialling a code specific to your telecom provider or by calling customer care.\n\nHowever, going by the unhappy crowd at NIMC\u2019s office, the prospect of a NIN-SIM linkage could still be a long way off for some people.\n\nTechpoint Africa embarked on a little trip to confirm the situation but met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were on the ground to disperse the crowd. It took over 45 minutes to make it across the gate, even when we had an ID card with PRESS boldly written on it.\n\nUsing forceful methods for crowd control, the Civil Defence Corps flogged Nigerians in the crowd. Sadly, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, also received a few strokes and a shove on the chest from the trigger-happy corps member.\n\nWhips and batons are used in riots and other violent situations. However, for a civil action like registering for a national identity, we find it worrying that whips, and not more humane solutions, are the preferred method for crowd control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn NSCDC member using a whip on Techpoint journalist\n\nUnnecessary NIN-SIM linkage crowds\n\nA lady at the scene confirmed that her SIM had been banned from making calls. While she could receive calls and use the Internet, she has been unable to make any calls since Monday.\n\nAccording to another lady, she has been coming to the NIMC office since the directive was given on Monday and has not been able to move past the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince Monday, there has been a crowd here. I\u2019ve been coming since Monday.\u201d\n\nA glance at the NIMC website reveals that these crowds and the ensuing whipping by Civil Defense staff could have been significantly avoided.\n\nInterestingly, one of our reporters, who had two of his SIMs blocked was able to quickly remedy this after dialing the respective NIN-SIM linkage codes for both service providers. One of his network providers is yet to block him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the NIMC compound. Some of these people have been here since Monday\n\nFrom the lady\u2019s explanation, she went to an agent enterprise to enrol for her NIN, had received her NIN, and linked it to her SIM. However, she has not been able to make calls since Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use money and to do it in another place, when you bring it, they will say that one is fake,\u201d she said.\n\nNIMC licenses these agents to serve as registration centres for enrolment and retrieval, among other things.\n\nHowever, going by the lady\u2019s story, even people who have registered and gotten their NIN are also affected.\n\nWe also noticed that people who lost their SIMs and had to retrieve them also faced the same predicament. Even though they had valid NINs already linked to the lost line.\n\nHow to validate your NIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section of the crowd at the NIMC office\n\nPeople in the lady\u2019s predicament and those in the latter situation have to go through a separate process called validation.\n\nSpeaking to staff within the compound concerning validation, we could not glean much.\n\n\u201cYou come here and validate,\u201d the staff said.\n\nWhen asked if it was a new process, she answered in the affirmative. \u201cIt\u2019s better to validate immediately you register.\u201d\n\nApparently, the validation process is usually done along with enrolment, which some people might have skipped for some reasons (including going through backdoors?); having your NIN might not be enough as it may be inactive.\n\nYou can solve this problem using the NIMC app, but you have to make sure to use the number connected to your NIN as you would receive a one-time password.\n\nDear Applicants,\n\n\n\nFor NIN Validation:\n\n\n\n1. Download the NIMC Mobile App\n\n2. Insert your NIN on the App\n\n3. The mobile number tied to you would be shown on the screen pic.twitter.com/ha1gPJYTQZ \u2014 NIMC (@nimc_ng) March 25, 2022\n\nIntriguingly, even though telecom companies can enrol people for their NINs, people on the scene complained that their network providers had redirected them to NIMC.\n\nMeanwhile, we hope you can make do with the information provided above and in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

However, the demise of online checkout company Fast, still caught me by surprise.\n\nAfter raising a whopping $102 million in 2021, the startup valued at $580 million is bowing out of the startup race, unable to increase its revenue and burning through $10 million monthly.\n\nFounded by Domm Holland and Allison Barr Allen, the American startup described as a trailblazer has raised $124 million since 2019.\n\nSadly, some Nigerians were caught up in Fast\u2019s journey from grace to grass. According to media organisation, NPR, Fast hired some Nigerian developers to build out an early version of its technology that was used to pitch to investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, they were laid off abruptly; they told NPR that their work was taken for granted.\n\nThe issue surrounding Nigerian developers and what they\u2019re worth has been in question for several years now. In 2017, we wrote an article based on an anonymous survey conducted in the same year.\n\nNevertheless, an update is needed.

Apparently, some crypto-related transactions slipped through without the banks detecting it.\n\nStanbic IBTC CEO, Wole Adeniyi, said the bank adhered to CBN\u2019s directive. However, the CBN could detect the transaction with technology banks do not have.\n\nDespite CBN\u2019s circular in 2020, crypto transactions reached an all-time high. In 2021, Paxful recorded all-time $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin p2p transactions in Nigeria.\n\nWith this fine, CBN has shown keen interest in keeping crypto off Nigerian streets, but will it work?\n\neNaira ranks best among retail CBDCs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom virtual currencies to central bank digital currencies (CBDC), Nigeria\u2019s eNaira has been ranked the most developed retail CBDC globally by PwC Global CBDC Index and Stablecoin Overview 2022.\n\nRetail CBDC? A retail CBDC is used for daily transactions like paying for items in the market. Wholesale CBDC, on the other hand, is used by financial institutions to buy and sell financial assets.\n\nAccording to the PwC Index, the eNaira had done more than 35,000 transactions as of December 2021.\n\nOther critical statistics presented by the report include 666,000 wallets created and 700,000 downloads from 160 countries.\n\nThe index composition was based on the current stage of the CBDC project, what the central bank says about CBDCs and public interest like Google trends.\n\nInterestingly, Nairametrics reported on Tuesday, April 5, 2022, that interest in eNaira had declined over time while cryptocurrencies have gotten increasingly popular in the country.\n\nHowever, the index also says that 75% of the points are awarded based on the stage of the CBDC. While Nigeria\u2019s eNaira is at the pilot stage, it has been deployed, and its wallet \u2014 Speed Wallet \u2014 has a significant amount of downloads.\n\nChina\u2019s CBDC \u2014 eCNY \u2014 ranked third but had higher stats than the eNaira. It had 261 million downloads and $13.7 billion in transactions.\n\nWhile the eNaira ranks first, people\u2019s interest in the CBDC has waned. However, only time will tell if the eNaira will become a preferred mode of transaction.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading.\n\nWhat was Zelenskyy doing at the Grammys?

          "title": "Nigeria fixing refineries while vandals break their pipelines",
          "text": "While the Nigerian National Petroleum Company has agreed terms with Afreximbank for a loan of $1 billion to rehabilitate the Port Harcourt refineries, the pipelines that would feed crude to the refinery are at the mercy of vandals \u2013 a development that could create fresh challenges for rehabilitated refineries.\n\nThe Federal Executive Council had in March last year approved the plan by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources to rehabilitate the Port Harcourt Refinery at the cost of $1.5 billion.\n\nTimipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, said in February this year that by the end of the year, all the refineries would be operating at reasonable capacity.\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you what capacity it will be operating by the time we leave but they will all be at least partially functional and we expect that since governance is a continuum, the next government will take up from wherever we stop and get it to the finishing line,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the minister\u2019s optimism has not been adjusted for sabotage on crude oil pipelines that will serve in the refineries.\n\nA recent report by analysts at Wood Mackenzie revealed in granular detail the extent of sabotage on crude oil pipelines resulting in an estimated loss of 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), which is twice Ghana\u2019s average daily oil production.\n\nTheft and vandalism hit Shell\u2019s Bonny pipeline system the hardest, leading to the declaration of force majeure at the Bonny terminal in March 2022 due to a drop in crude output.\n\nThe Bonny oil pipeline system, the largest pipeline network in the Niger Delta that transports oil, water, and associated gas from the eastern and central delta to the Bonny oil and gas terminal, was so badly affected that producers began to shun it.\n\nIts terminal, situated on Bonny Island, 48 kilometres southeast of Port Harcourt, is the biggest in Africa with a capacity to process and export 1.25 million bpd, but today it struggles to meet a quarter of its capacity.\n\nHeirs Oil & Gas averaged losses of 66 percent from OML 17 in 2021, peaking at 97 percent in December. The Nembe Creek Trunkline (operated by Aiteo) reported a downtime of up to 40 percent.\n\nSimilarly, Eni\u2019s Brass oil pipeline in the northern Niger Delta was heavily impacted, with local security contractors scrambling to deal with an unprecedented number of incidents.\n\nRead also: Reps order probe into $12bn trans-saharan gas pipeline project\n\nDue to pipeline sabotage, Eni declared force majeure at the Brass River oil terminal in March 2022, though the sabotage is concentrated at the Obiafu-Obrikom and Ebocha facilities.\n\n\u201cPipeline users upstream of these points will face losses of up to 50 percent,\u201d Wood Mackenzie analysts said.\n\nThe rampant crude theft in the Niger Delta is limiting Nigeria\u2019s ability to meet its OPEC+ quota as average production has hovered around 1.3 million bpd when it should be pumping up to 1.72 million bpd.\n\nAnalysts say unless sabotage of crude pipelines is stopped, splurging $1.5 billion in fixing the refineries would do little to advance Nigeria\u2019s desire to refine the petrol it uses.\n\n\u201cThis is why the government needs to do more to stem the tide of bunkering and other related issues such as oil theft,\u201d says Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield law firm.\n\nThe government has stepped up deployment of soldiers to troubled spots and has passed a Petroleum Industry Act that obligates oil companies to contribute 3 percent of their profits to a host community fund to foster development in the Niger Delta.\n\nBoth measures have done little to dent the problem as operators now report industrial-scale theft of crude oil sent into pipelines.\n\nSome local operators are adapting, exploring options that will significantly raise their cost of production and the eventual cost of the feedstock for the refineries if they become operational.\n\nSome are moving crude oil in smaller vessels known as barges. which tacks on an extra $15 to $20 per barrel cost.\n\nAnalysts at Wood Mackenzie noted that barging becomes cost-effective when losses exceed 20 percent, provided that oil prices are high enough to cover the additional cost. But logistics can limit barging volumes to a maximum of 20,000 bpd.\n\nHeirs Oil & Gas will start trucking and barging crude in 2022 and it also plans to build its own export pipeline to avoid the Trans-Niger trunk line.\n\nOther solutions employed by local operators include increased pipeline inspections using drones, installation of steel cages and closed-circuit television at wellheads and manifolds, and water separation at the export terminal so that lower-value wet crude flows down the pipeline.\n\nNigeria\u2019s refineries have a combined refining capacity of 445,000 bpd, located in Warri, Port Harcourt and Kaduna. It is unclear how much capacity would be restored after the rehabilitation. In addition to the $1.5 billion earmarked to be spent on the Port Harcourt Refinery repair, $897.6 million will go to the repair of Warri refinery and $586.9 million on the Kaduna refinery repair.\n\nThe net effect of these solutions is that Nigeria\u2019s cost of production, already some of the highest in the world, will worsen. Refineries may require subsidies to buy the crude cheaper.\n\nCrude oil is sold at international benchmark prices (Brent for Nigeria), if all the refineries come on stream, Nigeria supplies all the crude they require, it can expect to see savings on shipping, which analysts say may come down to less than 20 percent of the current value of petrol without subsidy.\n\nHence, without efficient production, even that value can be lost to thieves and sabotage.",

          "title": "Buhari gets new revenue formula",
          "text": "The Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) on Thursday submitted the new formula to President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nPresident Buhari, while receiving the new revenue report from the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), led by its Chairman Elias Mbam, said he will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process before presenting the report of the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nUnder the proposed vertical revenue allocation formula, the RMAFC advised 45.17 per cent for the Federal Government, 29.79 per cent for State Governments and 21.04 percent for Local Governments.\n\nUnder Special Funds, the Report by the Commission recommended 1.0 per cent for Ecology, 0.5 per cent for Stabilisation, 1.3 per cent for Development of Natural Resources and 1.2 per cent for the FCT.\n\nThe proposal seeks a 3.33% reduction in the current Federal Government allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07% and .44% for the States and Local Governments on the other hand.\n\nWith regards to Special Funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of .2% for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of .38% for Development of Natural Resources.\n\nPresident Buhari however, recounted that the Federal Government also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\n\nThe existing revenue formula indicates a vertical Revenue Allocation Formula of Federal Government 52.68%; State Governments 26.72%; Local Governments 20.60% and Derivation Formula 13%.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ordinarily, I would have gone ahead to table this report before the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula is a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, I will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nRead also: Reps probe crude production, revenue generated by NUPRC\n\nPresident Buhari listed some of the proposed amendments in the report as follows:\n\n\u2018\u2018Establishing local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President assured members of the Commission that the Federal Government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalization of the efforts by the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to the President, this strategy, rather than issuing an Executive Modification order, as was done in 1992, is more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\nHe commended the RMAFC for a job painstakingly done, pledging his unwavering commitment and support to them in carrying out their constitutional mandates.\n\nThe President also thanked Nigerians, especially the State and Local Governments, for making their inputs through the broad stake-holder engagement processes that produced the report.\n\nHis words:\n\n\u2018\u2018I am aware that the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as Privatisation, Deregulation, funding arrangement of Primary Education, Primary Health Care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our Revenue Sharing Formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari said as an advocate for grassroots development, he has always remained committed to ensuring that all tiers of Government are treated fairly, equally and justly in the sharing of national resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to let you all know that I have keenly followed most of the discussions held in the geo-political consultative process and one thing that struck me clearly was the agreement that a review of our vertical revenue formula cannot and should not be an emotional or sentimental discussion and it cannot be done arbitrarily.\n\n\u2018\u2018All over the world, revenue and resource allocation have always been a function of the level of responsibilities attached to the different components or tiers of government.\n\nRead also: States\u2019 huge debts, low revenues raise concerns\n\n\u2018\u2018I am, therefore, happy to note that the discussions were held along these lines and rested squarely on roles and responsibilities as spelt out in the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I also note that in reaching the final decisions at most of these engagements, not much emphasis was placed on the fact that the Second Schedule of the Nigerian constitution contains Sixty Eight (68) items on the Exclusive Legislative List and the remaining Thirty (30) items on the Concurrent List requiring both the Federal and State Government to address\u2019\u2019.\n\nPresident Buhari, therefore, declared that for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of Government.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level, for example: Primary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15% and the States and Local Government share 50% and 35% respectively,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the RMAFC followed due process in undertaking the exercise, and sought the opinion of the Federal Government before finalizing the report.\n\nGiving a synopsis of the report, Mustapha said that it was in four volumes, including a summary in the main report.\n\n\u2018\u2018Volume 1 contains the various memoranda submitted by the Federal and State Governments as well as the FCT. Volume 2 details the presentation from the academia, civil society, professional bodies, traditional rulers, individuals, as well as women and youth council.\n\n\u2018\u2018To complete the inclusiveness of the stakeholder participatory processes adopted, Volume 3 is a research that captures the body of knowledge that supported the review while Volume 4 is a further distillation of submissions by the State and Local Governments as well as NGOs and Area Councils of the FCT,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Mbam said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided \u2018\u2018by the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that the principles took into cognizance the indivisibility of the country, public opinion and weighted Constitutional responsibilities and functions of the three levels of Government.\n\nIn arriving at the new vertical revenue allocation formula, Mbam told the President the commission had wide consultation with major stakeholders, public hearing in all the geo-political zones, administered questionnaires and studied some other Federations with similar fiscal arrangements like Nigeria to draw useful lessons from their experiences.\n\nAccording to the RMAFC chairman, the Commission also visited all the 36 States and the FCT, the 774 Local Government Areas to sensitize and obtain inputs from stakeholders.\n\nHe added that literature reviews were conducted on revenue allocation formula in Nigeria dating back to the pre-independence period while the Commission received memoranda from the public sectors, individuals and private institutions across the country.\n\nExplaining the major reasons for the exercise, Mbam noted that since the last review was conducted in 1992, 29 years ago, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional States in 1996, which brought the number of States to 36.\n\nCorrespondingly, he said, the number of local governments councils also increased from 589 to 774.\n\n\u2018\u2018There have been considerable changes arising from the policy reforms that altered the relative share of responsibilities of the various tiers of Government such as deregulation, privatization and the lingering controversies over funding of primary education, primary healthcare,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe RMAFC chairman noted that while Section 32(b), Part 1 of Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution 9 (as amended) empowers the Commission to review from time to time the revenue allocation formulae; the inadequate and decaying infrastructure, as well as heightened widespread internal security challenges across the country also necessitated the exercise, among others.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRecently, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Phillip Shaibu flagged-off Lassa fever eradication campaign at Auchi. He called for total neatness and cleanliness within our environments and complete adherence to all preventive measures.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are here again to deal with the disease which is a major concern to government at the moment. Today, we decided to flag off Lassa fever eradication campaign. In 2018, we did a similar thing when Auchi was almost becoming an epidemic centre. With the cooperation of all major stakeholders at all levels, we were able to reduce the impact to a single digit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time, it is not to eliminate Lassa fever but to sustain the process to arrive at a zero digit. This time, we decided that our Royal father, the Otaru of Auchi should host us to quicken the message down to the various communities.\u201d\n\nLassa fever has caused Edo State more harm than any other diseases that has affected this state. Over twenty one persons have died of Lassa fever this year. This disease is preventable because it is transmitted to humans via rats even when it has ravaged our communities.\n\nLassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease. It was first discovered in Nigeria, when two missionary nurses became ill with the virus in 1969. Its name is derived from the village of Lassa, where it was first documented. Lassa fever is a viral infection carried by a type of rat that is common in West Africa. This is one of the most common rodents in equatorial Africa, found across much of sub-Saharan Africa. Lassa fever mainly occurs in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria. However, the Mastomys rat is common in neighboring countries, so these areas are also at risk.\n\nOnce a Mastomys rat is infected with the virus, it can excrete the virus in its faeces and urine, potentially for the rest of its life. As a result, the virus can spread easily, especially as the rats breed rapidly and can inhabit human homes. The most common method of transmission is by consuming or inhaling rat urine or faeces. It can also be spread through cuts and open sores.\n\nThe rats live in and around human habitation, and they often come into contact with foodstuffs. Sometimes people eat the rats, and the disease can be spread during their preparation. Person-to-person contact is possible via blood, tissue, secretions or excretions, but not through touch. Sharing needles may spread the virus, and there are some reports of sexual transmission. Lassa fever can also be passed between patients and staff at poorly equipped hospitals where sterilization and protective clothing is not standard.\n\nSymptoms include: Malaria, sore throat, bleeding in the gums, nose, eyes, or elsewhere, difficulty in breathing, a cough, vomiting and diarrhea, both with blood, difficulty swallowing, hepatitis, swollen face, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, shock, hearing loss, which may be permanent, high or low blood pressure etc.\n\nDeath can occur within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms due to multiple organ failure. However, health organizations hope that current work on vaccine development will be successful. Rehydration and treatment of symptoms can improve the chances of survival if there is an early diagnosis.\n\nThe main focus of prevention is \u201ccommunity hygiene,\u201d to control the rat population. These include: regular hand-washing, storing foods in rodent-proof containers, keeping garbage away from the home, keeping pet cats, avoiding blood and other bodily fluids when caring for sick relatives, following safe burial procedures, using protective equipment in a healthcare setting, including masks and eyewear. There is a test centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Irrua, Edo State University, Uzarue and the Edo State Government is presently planning a healthy to establish a centre at Auchi Central Hospital. .\n\nThe Mastomys rat is so widespread that it cannot realistically be eradicated. As a result, the main aim is to avoid these rodents and prevent them from sharing human habitation.\n\nComrade Shaibu said: \u201cIf we have a clean environment, then we are sure of having a healthy living.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, has received a proposal for new revenue sharing formula from the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\nThe report proposes a sharing formula of 45.17 percent for the federal government, 29.79 percent for state governments and 21.04 percent for the local governments.\n\nUnder the current sharing arrangement, the federal government takes 52.68 percent of the revenue shared, states get 26.72 percent while local governments get 20.60 percent.\n\nThe proposal comes on the heels of the review of the current revenue sharing formula by RMAFC, which commenced in June, last year.\n\nA statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson on Thursday, noted that Buhari said he will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process before presenting the report to the national assembly.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ordinarily, I would have gone ahead to table this report before the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula is a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, I will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Buhari outlined some of the recommendations in the report.\n\n\u2018\u2018Establishing local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president assured members of the commission that the federal government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalisation of the efforts by the national assembly.\n\nAccording to the president, this strategy, rather than issuing an Executive Modification order, as was done in 1992, is more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\n\u201cI am aware that the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as Privatisation, Deregulation, funding arrangement of Primary Education, Primary Health Care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our Revenue Sharing Formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, equitable distribution has always been observed in the sharing of national resources.\n\n\u201cI want to let you all know that I have keenly followed most of the discussions held in the geo-political consultative process and one thing that struck me clearly was the agreement that a review of our vertical revenue formula cannot and should not be an emotional or sentimental discussion and it cannot be done arbitrarily,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u2018\u2018All over the world, revenue and resource allocation have always been a function of the level of responsibilities attached to the different components or tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am, therefore, happy to note that the discussions were held along these lines and rested squarely on roles and responsibilities as spelt out in the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I also note that in reaching the final decisions at most of these engagements, not much emphasis was placed on the fact that the Second Schedule of the Nigerian constitution contains Sixty Eight (68) items on the Exclusive Legislative List and the remaining Thirty (30) items on the Concurrent List requiring both the Federal and State Government to address.\u201d\n\nBuhari, therefore, said for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of Government.\n\nHe noted that the proposal seeks a 3.33 percent reduction in the current federal government allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07 percent and 4.4 percent for the states and local governments.\n\nHe added that with regards special funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of 2 percent for the federal capital territory (FCT) and a decrease of 38 percent for development of natural resources.\n\nThe president said the FG also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula.\n\nAccording to him, this was based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\n\n\u201cWe must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level, for example: Primary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15% and the States and Local Government share 50% and 35% respectively,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nSpeaking, Elias Mbam, chairman of RMAFC, said the proposed vertical revenue allocation formula advised 45.17 percent for the FG, 29.79 percent for state governments and 21.04 per cent for the local governments.\n\nUnder special funds, he said, the report by the commission recommended 1.0 percent for ecology, 0.5 percent for stabilisation, 1.3 percent for development of natural resources and 1.2 percent for the FCT.\n\nIn arriving at the new vertical revenue allocation formula, Mbam said there was wide consultation with major stakeholders, public hearing in all the geo-political zones, administering of questionnaires and studying of some other federations with similar fiscal arrangements like Nigeria to draw useful lessons from their experiences.\n\nAccording to the RMAFC chairman, the commission also visited all the 36 states and the FCT, the 774 local government areas to sensitize and obtain inputs from stakeholders.\n\nHe added that literature reviews were conducted on revenue allocation formula in Nigeria dating back to the pre-independence period.\n\nHe added the commission received memoranda from the public sectors, individuals and private institutions across the country.\n\nMbam noted that since the last review was conducted in 1992, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional states in 1996, which brought the number of states to 36.\n\nCorrespondingly, he said, the number of local governments councils also increased from 589 to 774.",

          "text": "Pneumococcal disease is a worldwide disease and it is caused by an organism called the streptococcal pneumonia. In the developing world, young children and the elderly are most affected. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions from patients and healthy carriers. Serious pneumococcal infections include pneumonia, meningitis and febrile bacteraemia.\n\nA professor of medicine and consultant at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Prof. Olufunke Adeyeye, said the disease is very severe in adult population due to the fact that immunity wanes off with age.\n\nWhile citing WHO report, Adeyeye said about five per cent of all total cases of pneumococcal disease worldwide is said to occur in Nigeria. \u201cFive per cent is a lot. Africa and Asia contribute about two third of all the cases in the world and Nigeria just came third, after India and China. This is a major health problem that is not having enough attention,\u201d she added.\n\nOn economic impact, Adeyeye said the organism is a frequent cause of hospitalisation, adding that when people come down with community acquired pneumonia, particularly the elderly, they are usually very ill, and when they are hospitalised, they spend reasonable days in the hospital and money in paying for investigation, treatment/drugs.\n\n\u201cIt has a significant economic impact on patients. It can lead to blood borne infection and meningitis. Several local studies have showed that eight out of nine persons with meningitis due to this organism, die. This is a disease that can impact negatively on morbidity and mortality. Another study also showed that the mortality from pneumococcal infection in Nigeria, can be as high as 39 to 51 per cent,\u201c she said.\n\nOn the risk factors, Adeyeye said people who live in extreme poverty; people living in over-crowded places; people living with HIV and underlying conditions like pulmonary infection, asthma, chronic renal failure, liver problem and diabetes are predisposed to the disease.\n\nTo halt the high prevalence of the organism in Nigeria, the consultant said immunisation is an important strategy to prevent streptococcal pneumonia infection in whatever age one might be.\n\n\u201cStreptococcal pneumonia infection is a vaccine preventable disease for children and adult respectively. There is a recommendation that every adult between the age of 19 to 64, that have underlying chronic conditions that could reduce immunity in the body like diabetes, sickle cell disease and HIV, should receive a streptococcus pneumonia vaccine. Also, healthy adults (65 years and above) are advised to get streptococcus pneumonia vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe however tasked the media and relevant stakeholders to increase awareness and proffer ways of preventing pneumococcal disease, thereby reducing the burden in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Wole Soyinka has lamented the rising level of insecurity in the country, saying many Nigerians go out unsure they would return home safely. He believes the country needs help to tame insecurity.\n\nThe Nobel laureate spoke on the sidelines of a media briefing held in Lagos on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis government needs help, it no longer can cope,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt has been going on for years and I don\u2019t know if the citizens of this country should live under such a cloud, such uncertainty: get up in the morning and you don\u2019t know if you would get back at night.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: [Elections] Nigerian Youths Not Ready To Take Their Destinies In Their Hands \u2013 Soyinka\n\nSoyinka, who noted that the problem has been lingering for a while, blamed the judiciary, impunity, and others issues for contributing to the problem.\n\n\u201cThere has been laxity; there has been the encouragement of impunity; there has been compromise even within the judicial so that cases are not solved in time and seem to be solved very objectively,\u201d the literary giant explained.\n\n\u201cThere has been, of course, the sieving of money intended for the military to combat insurgency whether of the religious or the secular kind known as banditry.\n\n\u201cSo, it is a multi-level situation and it did not begin just now. If we don\u2019t keep stressing that, we would never get to the root of the problem.\u201d\n\nHe also berated the main political parties in Nigeria \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the wave of defections.\n\nAccording to him, such development does not augur well for the country\u2019s democracy. Soyinka equally lamented the youths\u2019 inability to take up leadership positions in the political space.\n\n\u201cThe youths of this nation don\u2019t seem to want to take their destiny into their own hands,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile recalling that he was part of the move for youths to present a consensus candidate during the 2019 election, he lamented that such did not materialise.\n\n\u201cWell, they failed to do that and I have a fear that this same thing will happen this year,\u201d the revered poet explained.",

          "text": "Shell has announced that it will write off between $4 and $5 billion in the value of its assets after pulling out of Russia following the country\u2019s unprecedented invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement offers a first glimpse at the potential financial impact to Western oil majors of exiting Russia.\n\n\u201cFor the first quarter 2022 results, the post-tax impact from impairment of non-current assets and additional charges (e.g. write-downs of receivable, expected credit losses, and onerous contracts) relating to Russia activities are expected to be $4 to $5 billion,\u201d Shell said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cThese charges are expected to be identified and therefore will not impact Adjusted Earnings.\u201d\n\nShell had previously estimated that Russia write-downs would reach $3.4 billion.\n\nFurther details of the impact of ongoing developments in Ukraine will be set out in Shell\u2019s first-quarter earnings report on May 5, the company said.\n\nShell was forced to apologize on March 8 for buying a heavily discounted consignment of Russian oil two weeks after Russia\u2019s invasion. It subsequently announced that it was withdrawing from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons.\n\nThe company said it would no longer purchase Russian crude oil and would shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia. The company had already vowed to exit its joint ventures with Russian gas giant Gazprom and its related entities.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s update, Shell also said its cashflow is expected to be hit by \u201cvery significant working capital outflows as price increases impacting inventory have led to a cash outflow of around $7 billion.\u201d\n\nDivestment \u2018outweighs reputational damage\u2019\n\nShell\u2019s share price fell 1.8% in early trade, along with that of fellow oil giant BP.\n\n\u201cDespite the eye watering costs, the share price should continue to stay reasonably resilient given the divestment far outweighs the reputational damage which could be caused had it not pulled out,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at British digital stockbroker AJ Bell, said the modest fall for Shell \u201creflects the fact that the company is also pointing to a big benefit from surging energy prices.\u201d\n\nHe added that BP\u2019s fall came \u201clikely on a read-across as investors looked at what it might imply for its much larger Russian footprint.\u201d\n\nShortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, BP announced that it would offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-controlled oil company Rosneft, after 30 years of operations in the country.\n\nWestern oil companies have faced pressure from shareholders and governments to sever ties with Russia, but TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne told CNBC in late March that the French company would not write off its assets in Russia as it would effectively mean giving them to Putin \u201cfor free.\u201d",

          "title": "Turkey Suspends Trial of Saudi Suspects in Khashoggi Killing",
          "text": "A Turkish court ruled Thursday to suspend the trial in absentia of 26 Saudis accused in the gruesome killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and for the case to be transferred to Saudi Arabia.\n\nKaghoggi, a United States resident who wrote critically about Saudi Crown Prince Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed on Oct. 2, 2018, at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. He had gone into the consulate for an appointment to collect documents required for him to marry his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged from the building.\n\nTurkish officials alleged that Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate by a team of Saudi agents sent to Istanbul. The group included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince\u2019s office. His remains have not been found.\n\nThe Istanbul court\u2019s decision comes despite warnings from human rights groups that turning the case over to the kingdom would lead to a cover up of the killing, which has cast suspicion on the crown prince.\n\nIt also comes as Turkey, which is in the throes of a deep economic downturn, has been trying to repair its troubled relationship with Saudi Arabia and an array of other countries in its region. Some media reports have claimed that Riyadh has made improved relations conditional on Turkey dropping the case , which had inflamed tensions between two countries.\n\nThe move would pave the way to a resolution of disputes between the two regional heavyweights since the 2011 Arab Spring, including Turkey\u2019s support for Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood, which Riyadh considers a terrorist group. Turkey also sided with Qatar in a diplomatic dispute that saw Doha boycotted by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nLast week, the prosecutor in the case recommended that it be transferred to the kingdom, arguing that the trial in Turkey would remain inconclusive. Turkey\u2019s justice minister supported the recommendation, adding that the trial in Turkey would resume if the Turkish court is not satisfied with the outcome of proceedings in the kingdom. It was not clear , however, if Saudi Arabia, which has already put some of the defendants on trial behind closed doors, would open a new trial.\n\nThe court ruled to halt the trial in line with the Justice Ministry\u2019s \u201cpositive opinion,\u201d the private DHA news agency reported.\n\nHuman rights advocates had urged Turkey not to transfer the case to Saudi Arabia, arguing that justice for Khashoggi would not be delivered by Saudi courts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandalous decision,\u201d said Emma Sinclair-Webb, the Turkey director for the New York-based Human Rights Watch, asserting that the court had \u201crubber stamped\u201d a political decision that would allow the government to repair its ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of realpolitik, Turkey is ready to sacrifice justice for an egregious crime on its own soil,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201c(The decision) opens the way for other countries to commit assassinations on Turkish territory and get away with it.\u201d\n\nCengiz, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, said she would continue to seek justice.\n\n\u201cWe will continue this (judicial) process with all the power given to me, as a Turkish citizen,\u201d she told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\n\u201cThe two countries may be making an agreement, the two countries may be opening a new chapter \u2026 but the crime is still the same crime,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who committed the crime haven\u2019t changed. Governments and states must have a principled stance.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the crime, Turkey apparently had the Saudi Consulate bugged and shared audio of the killing with the CIA, among others.\n\nThe slaying sparked international outrage and condemnation. Western intelligence agencies, as well as the U.S. Congress, have said that an operation of such magnitude could not have happened without knowledge of the prince.\n\nTurkey, which had vowed to shed light on the brutal killing, began prosecuting the defendants in absentia in 2020 after Saudi Arabia rejected requests for their extradition. The defendants included two former aides of the prince.\n\nSome of the men were put on trial in Riyadh behind closed doors. A Saudi court issued a final verdict in 2020 that sentenced five mid-level officials and operatives to 20-year jail terms. The court had originally ordered the death penalty, but reduced the punishment after Khashoggi\u2019s son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, announced that he forgave the defendants. Three others were sentenced to lesser jail terms.",

          "title": "Ukraine Seeks Arms from NATO as Fight Looms on Eastern Front",
          "text": "Ukraine told residents of its industrial heartland to leave while they still can and urged Western nations to send \u201cweapons, weapons, weapons\u201d Thursday after Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup for an offensive in the country\u2019s east.\n\nRussia\u2019s six-week-old invasion failed to take Ukraine\u2019s capital quickly and achieve what Western countries say was President Vladimir Putin\u2019s initial aim to oust the Ukrainian government. Russia\u2019s focus is now on the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn Brussels, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged NATO to provide more weapons for his war-torn country to help prevent further atrocities like those reported in Kyiv\u2019s northern suburbs. Ukrainian authorities are working to identify hundreds of bodies they say were found in Bucha and other towns after Russian troops withdrew and to document what they say were war crimes.\n\n\u201cMy agenda is very simple\u2026 it\u2019s weapons, weapons and weapons,\u201d Kuleba said as he arrived at NATO headquarters for talks with the military organization\u2019s foreign ministers about Ukraine\u2019s fight to defend itself.\n\n\u201cThe more weapons we get and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved,\u201d he said.\n\nSome NATO nations worry they may be Russia\u2019s next target, but the alliance is striving to avoid actions that might pull any of its 30 members directly into the war. Still, he NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged member nations to send Ukraine more weapons, and not just defensive arms.\n\n\u201cUkraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn\u2019t actually have any real meaning,\u201d he said.\n\nWestern countries have provided Ukraine with portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, but they have been reluctant to supply aircraft or tanks plus any equipment that Ukrainian troops would have to be trained to use.\n\nAsked what more his country was seeking, Kuleba listed planes, land-based missiles, armored vehicles and air defense systems.\n\nA U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russia had pulled all of its estimated 24,000 or more troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas in the north, sending them into Belarus or Russia to resupply, reorganize and likely prepare to return to fight in the east.\n\nGrowing numbers of Putin\u2019s troops, along with mercenaries, have been reported moving into the Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years and control two areas.\n\nAhead of its Feb. 24 invasion, Moscow recognized the Luhansk and Donetsk areas as independent states. Military analysts have said Putin also could be seeking to expand into government-controlled parts of the Donbas.\n\nDonetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said at least five civilians were killed and another eight were wounded by Russian shelling on Wednesday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged civilians to evacuate to safer regions before it was too late.\n\n\u201cLater, people will come under fire, and we won\u2019t be able to do anything to help them,\u201d Vereshchuk said.\n\nAnother Western official, also speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence estimates, said it may take Russia\u2019s battle-damaged forces as much as a month to regroup for a major push on eastern Ukraine.\n\nOleksandr Shputun, spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, reported Thursday that near Donbas, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, remained blockaded. He said Russian forces also were carrying out \u201cbrutal measures\u201d in the southern Kherson region, which they hold.\n\nIn his nightly address to the nation late Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.\n\n\u201cWe will fight and we will not retreat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won\u2019t give them up.\u201d\n\nIn areas north of the capital, Ukrainian officials gathered evidence of Russian atrocities amid signs Moscow\u2019s troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating.\n\nUkrainian authorities said the bodies of least 410 civilians were found in towns around Kyiv, victims of what Zelenskyy has portrayed as a Russian campaign of murder, rape, dismemberment and torture. Some victims had apparently been shot at close range. Some were found with their hands bound.\n\nWestern officials warned that similar atrocities were likely to have taken place in other areas occupied by Russian troops. Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of trying to cover up war crimes in areas still under their control, \u201cafraid that the global anger over what was seen in Bucha would be repeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have information that the Russian troops have changed tactics and are trying to remove the dead people, the dead Ukrainians, from the streets and cellars of territory they occupied,\u201d he said in a nighttime video address. \u201cThis is only an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more.\u201d\n\nSwitching from speaking Ukrainian to Russian, Zelenskyy urged ordinary Russians \u201cto somehow confront the Russian repressive machine\u201d instead of being \u201cequated with the Nazis for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nHe called on Russians to demand an end to the war, \u201cif you have even a little shame about what the Russian military is doing in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn reaction to the alleged atrocities outside Kyiv, the U.S. announced sanctions against Putin\u2019s two adult daughters and said it is toughening penalties against Russian banks. Britain banned investment in Russia and pledged to end its dependence on Russian coal and oil by the end of the year.\n\nThe U.S. Senate planned to take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia, paving the way for higher tariffs on some imports, and to codify President Joe Biden\u2019s executive action banning imports of Russian oil.\n\nThe European Union is also expected to take additional punitive measures, including an embargo on coal.\n\nThe Kremlin has insisted its troops have committed no war crimes and alleged the images out of Bucha were staged by the Ukrainians.\n\nBodies were still being collected in the city. On Wednesday, The Associated Press saw two in a house in a silent neighborhood. From time to time, the muffled boom of workers clearing the town of mines and other unexploded ordnance interrupted the silence.\n\nWorkers at a cemetery began to load more than 60 bodies into a grocery shipping truck for transport to a facility for further investigation.\n\nPolice said they found at least 20 bodies in the Makariv area west of Kyiv. In the village of Andriivka, residents said the Russians arrived in early March, taking locals\u2019 phones and detaining and then releasing some people. Others met unknown fates. Some described sheltering for weeks in cellars normally used for storing vegetables.\n\n\u201cFirst we were scared, now we are hysterical,\u201d said Valentyna Klymenko, 64. She said she, her husband and two neighbors weathered the siege by sleeping on stacks of potatoes covered with a mattress and blankets. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cry at first. Now we are crying.\u201d\n\nIn the southern port city of Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that of the more than 5,000 civilians killed during weeks of Russian bombardment and street fighting, 210 were children. Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death, he said.\n\nBoichenko said more than 90% of the city\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed. The attacks on the strategic city on the Sea of Azov have cut off food, water, fuel and medicine and pulverized homes and businesses.\n\nBritish defense officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000. A humanitarian relief convoy accompanied by the Red Cross has tried to get into the city for days, without success.\n\nCapturing Mariupol would allow Russia to secure a continuous land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nAP",
