          "text": "Says geoscience information readily available\n\nGreenfields, Brownfields set to unveil investment opportunities\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nIn a bid to bounce the economy back, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nRead Also:\n\nAfrican Athletics Championship: Amusan anchors Nigeria 4x100m relay to gold\n\nUpdate on Enugu 3-man delegates lawsuit and need to avoid legal landmines posed by constitution of the Party\n\nWe\u2019ve hope for Nigeria\u2019s gemstones industry \u2014 Adegbite\n\nHe also added that the Nigerian Government is seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, is the reason Nigeria is seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme (NIMEP), designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements (PGEs), Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery (DGPMR) Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe (Adegbite) also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey (BGS) to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA).\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration.\n\n\u201cThis has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury\u201d, he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Biodun Busari\n\nFormer Governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni has said some masked people are unleashing terror and arrests on his supporters ahead of the governorship election in the state slated for Saturday.\n\nHe went further that the assailants abducted one of his supporters, Kayode Adelusi who has not been found as the time of filing this report. He disclosed that some people close to the Presidency are behind the dastardly act, using their influence to launch undeserved arrests and oppression on his supporters.\n\nOni who is contesting to be governor under the platform of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, revealed these in an interview with Arise TV Morning Show monitored by Vanguard on Thursday.\n\nThe ex-governor then made an appeal to the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Usman Alkali Baba to check the arrests and protect the people of Ekiti State who have a civic duty of voting on Saturday.\n\nOni further said: \u201cTwo nights ago, armed people with face masks went to one of my supporters\u2019 place, Kayode Adelusi, they broke his door, abducted him and as I speak to you we don\u2019t know where he is.\n\n\u201cWe accept the fact that the IGP said adequate measure are in place to safeguard people in the state, but he must address the issue of indiscriminate arrest. These people are bringing oppression to people who didn\u2019t belong to them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, recall IGP Baba, has ordered the immediate mobilization and deployment of adequate police personnel, Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs), technical capabilities of the Police Airwing, the Force Marine, Mounted Troops, K-9 Section, and other operational assets for the successful conduct of the Ekiti State gubernatorial elections scheduled for Saturday.\n\nThis was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja on Sunday by the Force Public Relations Officer, FPRO, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi. This includes the deployment of selected seasoned strategic commanders from the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police and above for effective supervision of security personnel and operations in the election.\n\nThe IGP noted that the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) who is the supervisory DIG for the South-West Geo-Political Zone, DIG Johnson Babatunde Kokumo, psc(+), mni, has been deployed to Ekiti State as the Coordinator of the security component for the election.\n\n\u201cDIG Kokumo is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Operation Order evolved from the Election Security Threat Assessment, to ensure a peaceful and conducive environment devoid of violence and to guarantee law abiding citizens freely perform their civic responsibilities without molestation or intimidation,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSpeaking further, the ex-governor of Ekiti State dismissed reports in the media that he withdrew from the governorship race, adding that he cannot be easily enticed with money to step down for any political party\u2019s candidate as claimed by some stalwarts of the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nThe former governor affirmed that he is the most popular politician in the state, so could not fathom why he would have stepped down for any party, stressing that his political opponents were scared of his popularity.\n\nOni said, \u201cAPC is afraid, they know I\u2019m popular hence the lies. I believe that it shows the spirit of panic on APC side, I\u2019m the number one candidate, I\u2019m topmost, I am not withdrawing. I never cut any deal with APC.\n\n\u201cThis game is up for them, maybe that\u2019s why they concocted that I withdrew from the race. They should allow the people of Ekiti to pass their judgment.\n\n\u201cWhat will Asiwaju (Bola Tinubu) give me to make me withdraw from the race? Is it money, I\u2019m the type that cannot be easily moved by money; Is it that he (Asiwaju) wants to make me his VP, which is not possible?\u201d",

But, what they kept showing us is only the disadvantages.\n\n\u201cThey are looking at the waste and how to manage waste but we have capacity and capability of managing waste. Even the hospitals are generating waste and we have what it takes to manage wastes.\n\n\u201cI tried to show them that from the centre where I came, we have the waste management facilities. We manage those facilities.\n\n\u201cPlease, I am begging you, there are challenges ahead but there are also prospects. So, when you go out in advocacy and public awareness, the communities that are going to propose these facilities need to understand the benefits associated with Nuclear.\n\n\u201cYou can generate electricity but at least the host community also has some benefits of those facilities around them. Don\u2019t forget, the danger can be across borders.\n\n\u201cIf I have a Nuclear power plant in Kogi state for instance, the people of Kogi state will say they don\u2019t want it but when there is an accident in the nuclear power plant, it is not only Kogi, it is not only Nigeria \u2014 the whole of Africa will be contaminated.\n\n\u201cIt is across borders. Either through the water or air. So, the issue of saying I don\u2019t want it in my community, even if we mount it in another community, it will affect you\u201d, he added.\n\nThe DG further assured the group of the total support of the agency to enable them to achieve their set goals.\n\nEarlier, the President of NYGN, Jeremiah Mbazor, while commending the DG on his efforts in Nuclear advocacy, pointed out that all ideas suggested by the DG would be implemented in due time.\n\nHe said: \u201cwe are going to carry forth the word that you have given to us. We are going to speak more. Our media person here would have a lot of content to fill the public in with some of the questions that usually come in the comment section.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the programme organiser, Nojeeb Adamoh, while stating that the NYGN is poised to educate Nigerians on the benefits of Nuclear, solicited for support from NAEC.\n\nHe further invited the commission to the group\u2019s nuclear walk that would be taking place in Abuja from June 17 to 18.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

When he was chased out of Government House, he knew the role I played to bring him back, but how did he pay me back?\n\n\u201cNight meetings we attended to bring him back, ask him, ask Eselu Uga, ask Archbishop Anikwenwa, they know where and how we did it and he was brought back.\n\n\u201cAsk Peter since then what he used to reward Adoration. If you like Peter Obi, tell him to come and ask for forgiveness. Let him come and redo what he did. There is an altar of God he blasphemed; he defiled an altar of God, the Holy Spirit\u201d.",

          "text": "Fiery Catholic priest and Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka has given reasons why Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, can never win the presidency in 2023.\n\nThe cleric who was speaking during one of his programmes in Enugu, described the former Anambra Governor as a stingy man, insisting that he would never become president.\n\nMbaka, who had in an earlier viral video apologised to Obi over scathing remarks he made about him during the 2019 elections, said he did that under duress because of his bishop.\n\nHe declared that Obi can only become the President when God ceases to exist.\n\nAccording to the priest, it was better to have an old man as President than a \u2018stingy young man\u2019.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cA stingy man, that cannot give people his money, with this hunger ravaging the land, and you are saying he is the one you want. You want to die of hunger? Are you people insane? Where is the Holy Spirit?\n\n\u201cIt is now that Atiku is seriously contesting for President; now that he is contesting without Peter Obi; it is now that he is serious.\n\n\u201cWe want somebody that is serious. Unless Peter comes here to kneel, if he becomes president, he will close down this ministry. What we are doing is spiritual.\n\n\u201cListen, a good old man is better than a young wicked man; Peter Obi is going nowhere as far as God lives. If Igbos want a representative, it is not someone like Peter Obi.\n\n\u201cI should not have talked but I saw my video going round everywhere as if Fr. Mbaka wholeheartedly came out and apologised.\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t apologise wholeheartedly, it was out of duress. I had to obey my Bishop. In obedience I had to; it is not of my volition. I did it because I am a Catholic priest, my Bishop said, do it, my own is \u2018Yes my Lord\u2019.\n\n\u201cI did not say he(Obi) is a bad man; I said he is a stingy man. A hungry man wants someone that is generous; the man has so much money, but he is \u2018I, me, myself\u2019. But that money will not be useful to him. I am very happy now that I have spoken out. That apology is a poisonous curse against Peter Obi.\n\n\u201cIf he is wise he should have come here after that apology to say he is sorry but he waited. Anybody supporting him is wasting his money, he is going nowhere.\n\n\u201cHe is my friend. When he was chased out of Government House, he knew the role I played to bring him back, but how did he pay me back? Night meetings we attended to bring him back, ask him, ask Eselu Uga, ask Archbishop Anikwenwa, they know where and how we did it and he was brought back.\n\n\u201cAsk Peter since then what he used to reward Adoration. If you like Peter Obi, tell him to come and ask for forgiveness. Let him come and redo what he did. There is an altar of God he blasphemed; he defiled an altar of God, the Holy Spirit.\n\n\u201cI called Atiku in 2019; he was in Dubai. I told him that there is a revelation on your presidential election; that you are going to be the President of Nigeria on one condition, that Peter Obi is not going to be your running mate. Peter Obi has incurred a curse to himself, which means that he is carrying a curse; if you want to be President, change him.\n\n\u201cAtiku responded that I cannot, Peter must be my running mate, we must win. You saw what happened. Atiku is still alive. That is why I said it is now that Atiku is preparing to be President.\n\n\u201cNever you quarrel with a prophet. If you must quarrel with anybody let it not be a prophet.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask Atiku to give me one Kobo. But do what you should do. Without that, you fail. He took Peter and failed\n\n\u201cJust like during (Goodluck) Jonathan, I told President Jonathan. He was my friend then. I called him(that) God has shown that you are going to win this election but on one condition; Jega should be changed. If you change Jega you will win Buhari but if you don\u2019t, Buhari will win you. Goodluck told me, \u2018Fr. I will not remove Jega, we will still win\u2019. He held on to Jega and failed. Then, people started saying that Mbaka was supporting Buhari\u201d.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe development came just as the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will today screen its vice presidential aspirants.\n\nA top member of the APC told Daily Sun that the tension in the camps of various interest groups scrambling for the vice presidential candidate slot is boiling over.\n\nHe said the issue of religion has become for Tinubu a hard nut to crack as he is still not certain how to wriggle through the choice between a Muslim/Muslim or Muslim/Christian ticket.\n\n\u201cTinubu is between the devil and the deep blue sea. If he chooses a Muslim as a running mate, Christians would complain. If he ignores some powerful forces pushing for some popular Muslims as his running mate, such a decision may not go down well with them. Whatever happens, Asiwaju must take a decision in a matter of hours,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the main opposition party would today screen its aspirants for the vice presidential slot.\n\nThe special panel saddled with the responsibility of shopping for a running mate for the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar had, on Tuesday, settled for Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, as its preferred choice for vice presidential slot.\n\nHowever, the party is yet to make a formal announcement on the choice of Wike as its 2023 vice presidential candidate.\n\nThe opposition party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the screening panel will be headed by former Minister of External Affairs, Tom Ikimi.\n\nOther members of the panel are former governor of Kogi State, Idris Wada , former Aviation minister, Osita Chidoka, former deputy speaker, House of Representatives, Austin Opara among others.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cPursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the the Electoral Guidelines of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party, the National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the nomination of the following party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated vice presidential candidate of our party for the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the PDP NWC in its meeting, yesterday, considered the report of the special panel and have forwarded same to Atiku.\n\nHowever, a source at the PDP secretariat stated that the report forwarded to the party\u2019s presidential candidate, also included Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and his Akwa Ibom counterpart, Udom Emmanuel.\n\nRegardless, a leader of the PDP in the South East, who declined to be mentioned, said the vice presidential candidate ought to have been chosen from the zone, in the spirit of equity, fairness and balance.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiving the position to South East will usher in peace and harmony in the PDP going into the 2023 elections instead of the South South that is already a battle field among the aspirants.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nSome members of the House of Representatives, yesterday, charged the parliament to override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto on the amendment the Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act.\n\nThis was sequel to a point of order raised by a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member from Delta State, Ben Igbakpa, calling the attention of the House to the failure of the president to assent to amendment over 30 days after it was transmitted to him.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe House had on May 11 altered Section 84( 8) of the Electoral Act to make provision for statutory delegates in political parties primaries to nominate candidates for the 2023 polls. However, the president did not sign the amendment, and is yet to communicate to the House on the bill.\n\nThe current version, which was assented to by the president in February, prevented statutory delegates from taking part in party primaries.\n\nThe House while on recess convened an emergency session to amend Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nLawmakers, governors, Ministers, the president among others could not participate during the just concluded party primaries as statutory delegates were not allowed. This was not unconnected with the president\u2019s refusal to sign the amended 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nOn Monday, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila blamed the ad-hoc delegates system used for the conduct of political parties primaries for the loss of many members at the primaries.\n\nHowever, Igbakpa, while addressing the House, said since the president has failed to assent to the bill within the 30 days window provided by the constitution, the appropriate thing is for the parliament to override him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere it is said that one arm of government is subservient to the other\u2026And that is why we cannot continue to act as if we are under the executive arm of government. This Constitution gave us the powers just as it gave to them.\n\n\u201cWe must wake up as a parliamentarians. Where we pass our law and we are sure we have done the right thing we should start overriding Mr. President because this is just the beginning. Today NDDC Act is enforced because the parliament which you are part of did it. What are we afraid of?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, implored the House to activate the relevant constitutional provision and over ride the president.\n\nThe speaker, in his ruling, charged the lawmakers to come up with a motion on the override today. He noted that the parliament needs two-third majority to override the President on any bill.\n\n\u201cClearly the Constitution says it is 30 days leeway and we have gone beyond the 30 days. But the Constitution also says that it is not automatic that you override. If you are not convinced with the argument advanced by the president or in some cases and in this case, there is no arguments advanced, then you can override. But for us to override, I believe the required two-thirds and it cannot be by voice votes neither can it be by way of signatures unless of course you gave enough signatures by two-thirds.\u201d\n\nIn another motion by Benjamin Kalu, the House urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), to extend the voter registration by 60 days.\n\nThe Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise is scheduled to end on June 30.\n\nThe House urged INEC to extend the voters registration deadline by an extra 60 days to enable as many Nigerians as possible to register.\n\nKalu said the decision to suspend the voters\u2019 registration was in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022, which required INEC to suspend voters\u2019 registration at least 60 days before an election.\n\nHe said in April, INEC declared that about 42 per cent of the voter registrations recorded since the commencement of CVR on 28 June, 2021, were invalid with about 20 million unclaimed Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs)\n\nKalu also said the large number of unregistered eligible voters willing to be registered as evidenced by crowd seen at various registration centres had resulted in congestion.\n\nHe expressed concern due to reports of shortages of voter registration machines, inadequate manpower and personnel at registration centres.\n\nAccording to him, this may lead to frustration among prospective registrants, and in some cases, unrest at some registration centres.\n\nHe said the right to vote was critically important to the health and legitimacy of the country\u2019s democracy, as well as electoral integrity.\n\nKalu stated that if nothing was done to improve the shortage of voter registration equipment, and extend the deadline for voters registration, millions of Nigerians would be disenfranchised, which would jeopardise the integrity of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe House, therefore mandated the Committee on Electoral Matters to engage INEC in order to examine and proffer solutions to the shortage of registration machines and manpower.\n\nHe added that INEC should also deploy an additional 30 voters registration machines in each local government area, train and deploy ad-hoc staff to improve the shortage of manpower at registration centres.\n\nHe added that security should also be provided for the ad hoc staff and report back within two weeks.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Nobody should be arrested unlawfully while others are being protected. The clampdown must be total.\n\n\u201cIf anyone commits an offence, let him be arrested lawfully through a warrant of arrest.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Lopsided Promotion Of Officers By Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Narcotics Agency, NDLEA Favours Candidates Of Political Office Holders, Denies Others For About 20 Years",
          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), through its harmonisation exercise, has allegedly denied some officers promotion for about 20 years, while some of their colleagues recruited much later after have been promoted up to two times.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the affected officers include CNA conversion course 1/2008 which comprised NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98, who were already on CNA rank earlier before January 2004; with effective dates of promotion to ASNII dating back to 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 for NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98 respectively.\n\nHowever, sources in the agency told SaharaReporters that while the affected officers\u2019 promotions have been stagnated for more than 15 years, those employed in \u201c2011, mostly candidates of political office holders, enjoyed double promotions ahead and above their older colleagues whom they met on the job and were stagnated on level 7 and below\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe sources said that their promotions have been cumulatively stagnated for about 10 to 20 years which translates to a loss of three to six ranks.\n\n\n\nWhile admitting that they were promoted by one rank in the 2021 harmonisation exercise, one of the sources, however, pointed out that the promotion still kept them below their juniors who have received multiple promotions backdated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most recent NA course who were recruited as SNAs 13 to 17 years after our recruitment, and 4 to 7 years after our ideal ASN II effective dates, were promoted ahead of us going by their effective dates,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the stagnation of their careers and distortion of their seniority in the service predates 2014, adding that \u201cby 2014, some of us were already stagnated for up to 10 years\u201d.\n\n\n\nExplaining the process of conversion and how their promotion has been lopsidedly stagnated, another source said, \u201cThe criteria for successful conversion to the superintendent cadre is that the officer should have additional qualifications and attend mandatory conversion course.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the requirement of additional qualifications was waived for conversion courses 1 and 2 in favour of years of service and attainment of 50% cut-off mark as against 40% in normal promotion examinations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have served and kept fate with the agency in deprivation, and denied most of our benefits for 23 to 27 years, giving our youths, bearing the scars, dangers of the lowest level of servitude while aligning our aspirations to the vision of the agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further explained that against its standard of conducting promotion examinations yearly, NDLEA did not conduct the examinations in 2006 and 2007, thereby denying CNAs who had resit the opportunity of promotion to ASN II with 2005 and 2006 effective dates their due opportunity to be promoted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all CNAs with earlier or 2004 effective dates were made to go through conversion course 1/2008 with no cognizance of the fact that some older NA courses 7/94 and 8/96 were on re-sit. This, the source, said is in contradiction to the normal promotion condition that those on re-sit need only retake their papers to be promoted.\n\nThe imposition of the conversion course on these unprepared sets of officers made them unsuccessful in conversion course 1, it was learnt.\n\n\n\nAlso, though the NDLEA Scheme of Service provides that the conversion course should be yearly, one of the sources said it was not conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and \u201cthis also denied the unsuccessful candidates of conversion course 1, the opportunity of getting back on track with our career progression\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe negative impact was heightened thus,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nBy 2014 when they were eventually promoted to ASN II by virtue of CNA conversion course 2013; their promotion which would have been with effective dates of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were still on CNA for 10, 9, 8, and 7 years after.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect is loss of up to three ranks, meaning that as at 2013/2014 promotions, we would have been on the ranks of CSN, SN and DSN respectively. Though the effective dates of promotion of successful candidates of CNA conversion course 1 were backdated appropriately, that of CNA course 2/2013 converted officers were not backdated,\u201d the source continued.\n\n\n\nHe lamented that the negligence has affected them both financially and psychologically, especially as many of them draw closer to their retirement age.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cAs our juniors are being promoted far ahead of us, we struggle daily with low self-esteem, ridicule, disgrace, indiscipline and shattered self-confidence. Going by our years of service and staring retirement in the face, the bleakness of our service life aspirations confronts us daily. The instances of career stagnation have excluded us from any serious service responsibility like mid-level command responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmongst other things, one of the sources on behalf of the affected officers appealed to the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (Rtd), to place them on their ideal ranks of CSN and ACN and DCN, as this will help them rectify the distorted seniority issues.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that their effective dates of promotions should reflect their ideal career progression save for the loss of seniority through re-sit, and in the event of challenges of federal character and vacancy in their placement, harmonization or promotion to ACN and above, the CSN effective date should reflect their ideal career progression.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, they want the date of their first appointment and subsequent years of service to be used to place them accordingly, while individual service records are sought and used to place them properly with the correct effective dates according to individual peculiarities.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that in line with the NDLEA conditions of service 2019, the issue of additional qualifications should not affect the career progression of converted officers in the area of pegging, considering the fact that it was waived in favour of higher cut-off marks.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Lopsided Promotion Of Officers By Nigeria\u2019s Anti-Narcotics Agency, NDLEA Favours Candidates Of Political Office Holders, Denies Others For About 20 Years",
          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), through its harmonisation exercise, has allegedly denied some officers promotion for about 20 years, while some of their colleagues recruited much later after have been promoted up to two times.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the affected officers include CNA conversion course 1/2008 which comprised NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98, who were already on CNA rank earlier before January 2004; with effective dates of promotion to ASNII dating back to 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 for NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98 respectively.\n\nHowever, sources in the agency told SaharaReporters that while the affected officers\u2019 promotions have been stagnated for more than 15 years, those employed in \u201c2011, mostly candidates of political office holders, enjoyed double promotions ahead and above their older colleagues whom they met on the job and were stagnated on level 7 and below\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe sources said that their promotions have been cumulatively stagnated for about 10 to 20 years which translates to a loss of three to six ranks.\n\n\n\nWhile admitting that they were promoted by one rank in the 2021 harmonisation exercise, one of the sources, however, pointed out that the promotion still kept them below their juniors who have received multiple promotions backdated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most recent NA course who were recruited as SNAs 13 to 17 years after our recruitment, and 4 to 7 years after our ideal ASN II effective dates, were promoted ahead of us going by their effective dates,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the stagnation of their careers and distortion of their seniority in the service predates 2014, adding that \u201cby 2014, some of us were already stagnated for up to 10 years\u201d.\n\n\n\nExplaining the process of conversion and how their promotion has been lopsidedly stagnated, another source said, \u201cThe criteria for successful conversion to the superintendent cadre is that the officer should have additional qualifications and attend mandatory conversion course.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the requirement of additional qualifications was waived for conversion courses 1 and 2 in favour of years of service and attainment of 50% cut-off mark as against 40% in normal promotion examinations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have served and kept fate with the agency in deprivation, and denied most of our benefits for 23 to 27 years, giving our youths, bearing the scars, dangers of the lowest level of servitude while aligning our aspirations to the vision of the agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further explained that against its standard of conducting promotion examinations yearly, NDLEA did not conduct the examinations in 2006 and 2007, thereby denying CNAs who had resit the opportunity of promotion to ASN II with 2005 and 2006 effective dates their due opportunity to be promoted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all CNAs with earlier or 2004 effective dates were made to go through conversion course 1/2008 with no cognizance of the fact that some older NA courses 7/94 and 8/96 were on re-sit. This, the source, said is in contradiction to the normal promotion condition that those on re-sit need only retake their papers to be promoted.\n\nThe imposition of the conversion course on these unprepared sets of officers made them unsuccessful in conversion course 1, it was learnt.\n\n\n\nAlso, though the NDLEA Scheme of Service provides that the conversion course should be yearly, one of the sources said it was not conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and \u201cthis also denied the unsuccessful candidates of conversion course 1, the opportunity of getting back on track with our career progression\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe negative impact was heightened thus,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nBy 2014 when they were eventually promoted to ASN II by virtue of CNA conversion course 2013; their promotion which would have been with effective dates of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were still on CNA for 10, 9, 8, and 7 years after.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect is loss of up to three ranks, meaning that as at 2013/2014 promotions, we would have been on the ranks of CSN, SN and DSN respectively. Though the effective dates of promotion of successful candidates of CNA conversion course 1 were backdated appropriately, that of CNA course 2/2013 converted officers were not backdated,\u201d the source continued.\n\n\n\nHe lamented that the negligence has affected them both financially and psychologically, especially as many of them draw closer to their retirement age.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cAs our juniors are being promoted far ahead of us, we struggle daily with low self-esteem, ridicule, disgrace, indiscipline and shattered self-confidence. Going by our years of service and staring retirement in the face, the bleakness of our service life aspirations confronts us daily. The instances of career stagnation have excluded us from any serious service responsibility like mid-level command responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmongst other things, one of the sources on behalf of the affected officers appealed to the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (Rtd), to place them on their ideal ranks of CSN and ACN and DCN, as this will help them rectify the distorted seniority issues.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that their effective dates of promotions should reflect their ideal career progression save for the loss of seniority through re-sit, and in the event of challenges of federal character and vacancy in their placement, harmonization or promotion to ACN and above, the CSN effective date should reflect their ideal career progression.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, they want the date of their first appointment and subsequent years of service to be used to place them accordingly, while individual service records are sought and used to place them properly with the correct effective dates according to individual peculiarities.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that in line with the NDLEA conditions of service 2019, the issue of additional qualifications should not affect the career progression of converted officers in the area of pegging, considering the fact that it was waived in favour of higher cut-off marks.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The IFC backs Gozem's vehicle financing project with $10m in funding",
          "text": "12 million.\n\nThat\u2019s the estimated number of motor vehicle drivers that Gozem, a Francophone Africa-focused super app, says operate in informal markets across West and Central Africa. But there\u2019s a problem: these drivers do not have access to traditional banks or micro-finance institutions to finance their vehicles. Instead, they rely on money lenders that charge ridiculous interest rates\u2014some are as high as 70% annually.\n\nGozem, which provides a suite of mobility, e-commerce, and financial services to drivers, retailers, and other consumers, announced on Friday that it has partnered with the International Financial Commission (IFC) to solve these headaches for drivers.\n\nIFC has dedicated a $10 million investment into Gozem\u2019s vehicle financing project. This investment will enable Gozem to provide access to affordable vehicle financing in Togo and Benin, its operating markets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis deal comes about 6 months after Gozem closed a $5 million funding and 14 months after it started its vehicle financing program. The company said it has already helped more than 2,000 drivers acquire vehicles with affordable financing. This new partnership will finance new vehicles for 6,000 more drivers.\n\n\u201cMotor vehincle drivers in West and Central Africa will need access to $3 billion dollars of credit facilities annually to finance their vehicles and we are excited that IFC is placing their trust in Gozem to be at the forefront of providing affordable financing solutions to these underserved communities,\u201d Gregory Costamagna, co-founder and co-CEO of Gozem, said in a statement.\n\nUnlike banks that require credit history, asset collateral, or guarantors before issuing loans, or third-party lenders who charge cut-throat interest rates that are only increasing, Gozem simply uses drivers\u2019 data already available on its platform. The company provides this service by leveraging what Costamagna called its \u201csophisticated\u201d KYC process, financial and behavioural data, like the number of trips completed using its app\u2014which can be accessed in a matter of minutes\u2014to calculate drivers\u2019 credit worthiness. This alleviates drivers from keeping track of their bank statements and records; simply by using the app to find riders and gigs, Gozem knows how much they earn and how long they are likely to take to make their payments.\n\nGozem said in a statement sent to TechCabal that for the next year, they will also work with the IFC to test electric bikes in motovehicle operating conditions and \u201cbuild a green battery-swapping station network in Togo and Benin to demonstrate electric bikes can save drivers money.\u201d\n\nGozem\u2019s Raphael Dana, Costamagna\u2019s counterpart as co-founder and co-CEO told TechCabal over the phone that IFC is starting a pilot investment to test the impact and scalability of this model and will double down based on the result of the pilot.\n\nHe added that this partnership also factors in electric vehicles (EV). \u201cWe have set aside 10% of the investment for our EV pilot phase. There\u2019s a dedicated team working on our EV ambition and we need to ensure that the bikes, battery swapping, economic units, etc. work at scale,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, the project will \u201cvalidate electric bikes and that their adoption at scale will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but it will also help drivers save money through lower energy and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric vehicles have the power to said Aliou Maiga, IFC\u2019s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, emphasised that EVs have the potential to \u201ctransform the moto-taxi market in West and Central Africa by lowering carbon emissions and lowering operating costs for drivers.\u201d She said that by partnering with Gozem, together they could \u201cincrease affordable and green financing solutions for moto-taxi drivers to shift to electric bikes.\n\n\u201cWe hope IFC\u2019s investment for these underserved communities will encourage other investors and accelerate the reduction of poverty and greenhouse gasses emissions in these markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant uptick in access financing initiatives lately. Last year, Asaak went into a partnership with Untapped Global to finance 2,000 bikes in Uganda\u2014both EV and fossil-fuel vehicles. Untapped Global had also entered a similar partnership with South African Flexclub.\n\nLooks like Gozem is gearing up for some big funding. In March, Dana told Africa Report that the company was seeking an $80m Series B\u2014$50 million in equity, $20m in debt, and a $10 million pre-series B\u2014fundraising as it prepares to expand to new markets like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Senegal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "NITDA's Code of Practice to help Nigeria regulate social media",
          "text": "Months after it lifted its 7-month ban on Twitter, the Nigerian government has set out to regulate social media platforms with a new Code of Practice. Plans for the Code of Practice were announced in January by Director-General of NITDA, Mr Kashifu Inuwa.\n\nYesterday, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) announced that it had developed a draft Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries\u2014defined by the code as \u201celectronic medium or site where services are provided by means of a computer resource and on-demand and where users create, upload, share, disseminate, modify, or access information, including websites that provide reviews, gaming Platform, online sites for conducting commercial transactions.\u201d\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n13th June 2022\n\n\n\nNational Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Issues a Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries and Conditions for Operating in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/N9y3qfyCIu \u2014 NITDA Nigeria (@NITDANigeria) June 13, 2022\n\nAccording to NITDA, the draft was developed in collaboration with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC), with input from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and TikTok.\n\nIn the statement signed by NITDA Head of Corporate Affairs and External Relationships, Hadiza Umar, the Code is supposedly aimed at \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country, as well as defining guidelines for interacting on the digital ecosystem\u201d.\n\nWhat the Code instructs\n\nNITDA instructs that all Interactive Computer Service Platforms with more than 100,000 users would be required to fulfil certain conditions in order to operate in the country. While this includes US-based social media platforms, it also includes indigenous sites like Nairaland, blogs like Linda Ikeji, and newsletter platforms like Substack with over 100,000 users.\n\nThese platforms would have to register as legal entities with the country\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), pay taxes, appoint country representatives, and more notably, \u201cprovide information to the Nigerian government on harmful accounts, troll groups, and deleting all information that violates Nigerian law\u201d.\n\nThe draft Code is divided into 5 parts with the first 2 parts laying down the responsibilities of the Interactive Computer Service Platforms, while Part IV\u2014titled \u201cProhibitions\u201d\u2014lays down orders for the removal of material prohibited by Nigerian law. According to the draft, \u201cProhibited Material\u201d includes anything that threatens public interest, order, security, peace and morality\u2014content which must be taken down within 24 hours.\n\nIn Part I of the draft Code, NITDA lays down 11 primary responsibilities which include abiding by Nigerian laws, providing dedicated channels for government agencies to lodge complaints, removing any content reported by government agencies within 24 hours, disclosing identities of reported creators to the Nigerian government, and expeditiously removing non-consensual sexual content.\n\nPart II of the draft Code consigns 12 additional responsibilities including the requirement for Interactive Computer Service Platforms to file annual compliance reports that detail the numbers of [active] registered Nigerian users, deactivated accounts, and removed content, among other things. This part lists the responsibilities of the platforms to inform the users of their obligations which include abiding by all Nigerian laws.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poor regulatory history\n\nThere are few provisions within the draft Code that fulfills NITDA\u2019s aim of \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians\u201d. For example, Items 4 and 5 of Part I seek to protect Nigerians from promoting revenge porn and child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), while Item 1 of Part II promotes equal distribution of information for Nigerian users.\n\nAccording to \u2018Tooni Ajiboye, a lawyer and writer, \u201cThe good part of the bill is that it tries to hold these social media platforms accountable for all the information and mechanisms promoted on their platform. There are, however, red flags in the draft Code and they unfortunately outweigh the good.\u201d\n\nAs Ajiboye explains it, the biggest red flag in the draft Code is how much information it wants to control. \u201cThere are about 5 classes of information highlighted: misinformation, disinformation, harmful content, unlawful content, and prohibited materials. While unlawful content already has legal backing, misinformation and harmful content are left to discretion. It\u2019s easy to point out where child sexual abuse materials are criminalised in Nigerian law but the same can\u2019t be said for what the draft defines as prohibited or harmful material.\u201d\n\nPart IV of the code, which examines Prohibited Material, prescribes that all content that is contrary to morality, or public interest should be deleted once a complaint is made. This brings to light the possibility of the Nigerian government going after citizens who post materials in support of LGBTQ persons, or anyone posting content deemed religiously \u201cblasphemous\u201d, a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment in many Nigerian states.\n\nPart IV of NITDA\u2019s draft Code of Practice\n\nWhile these provisions wouldn\u2019t constitute a problem in other regions, Nigeria\u2019s history is riddled with fundamental human rights infringement and the misappropriation of laws. In the events following its #EndSARS protests where Nigerian youths fighting against police brutality were thrust into the global spotlight, many faced imprisonment and financial sanctions due to their involvement on and off social media.\n\nThe #EndSARS event, which also sparked commentary from celebrities like Rihanna, Trevor Noah, and ex-US president Barack Obama, spurred numerous attempts by the Nigerian government to regulate social media. There was the social media bill of 2019, and the hate speech bill which proscribed death as the penalty for hate speech. In 2021, there was also an attempt to modify the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to cover social media platforms.\n\nNigerians are against the bill\n\nSince the bill was announced yesterday, many Nigerians have taken to social media, specifically Twitter, to express their concerns over the bill.\n\nLawyer and satirist Elnathan John said, \u201cThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media.\u201d\n\nThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media. https://t.co/JPhGnQp5GT \u2014 Elnathan John (@elnathan_john) June 14, 2022\n\nAjiboye noted that the Code is still in its draft stage so there\u2019s the possibility that most of its provisions would be revised. \u201cSpeaking objectively, they\u2019re releasing the draft so they can get feedback from stakeholders and ensure that whatever is enacted is palatable to the people the Code will apply to.\u201d\n\nThe draft Code is yet to be enacted but many Nigerians have been encouraged by Digital Africa Research Labs, an NGO studying social media misuse on the continent, to send their comments to NITDA at info@nitda.gov.ng. TechCabal has reached out to Digital Africa Research Labs for more comments but is yet to receive responses at the time of publication.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Electricity operators in Nigeria have committed to delivering 5,000MW of power from July 1, under the pain of sanctions if they default, the regulator has said.\n\nSanusi Garba, Chairman, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) in a press briefing on Wednesday in Lagos, said the absence of commercial contracts underpinning transactions within the sector has been a major challenge and the commission was poised to resolve this.\n\n\u201cEffectively from July 1, all electricity market participants have committed to 5,000MW.\n\n\u201cWe are currently moving to ensure that we achieve stability now and that is why the government is making investments to improve the grid so that 5,000MW will be our benchmark from July,\u201d Garba said.\n\nThe new contracts, according to the NERC Chairman, obligate power distribution companies (DisCos) to take the power sent to them or pay for it.\n\nIt will also compel the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), the Federal Government-owned participant, to ensure that the grid remains stable enough to wheel the contracted volumes from July.\n\nPower generation companies have also been compelled to sign contracts with gas suppliers for the required gas volumes to maintain the projected power delivery.\n\nRead also: How electricity distribution companies are finding profit across geopolitical zones\n\nEighty percent of Nigeria\u2019s power generation is from gas-fired power plants and a lack of firm contracts has forced suppliers to prioritise other users, said Sanusi.\n\nThe commission, he said was moving to ensure that all contracted gas volumes are fully paid for.\n\nThe NERC chairman said the commission was going to enforce this contract by ensuring that erring market operators pay stiff penalties for failing to meet their obligation.\n\n\u201cWe have had discussions with all the participants and secured their commitments. All stakeholders have made a commitment and there will be consequences for failing to meet them.\n\n\u201cDisCos will pay damages in the event that they reject power.\n\n\u201cBut beyond paying penalties, we are keen to resolve the issues in the power sector and that is why we are engaging all the players to ensure that the rules are followed,\u201d Garba said.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s 17.7% inflation raises concerns over food security",
          "text": "The inflation rate in Nigeria accelerated in May to its highest level in 11 months, official data released on Wednesday show, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and economic analysts in the country saying the price growth raises concerns over food security.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics said the inflation rate increased to 17.71 percent in May from 16.82 percent in April.\n\nFood inflation rose to 19.50 percent, the highest in eight months, compared to 18.37 percent in the previous month.\n\n\u201cThe rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, food products, potatoes, yam, and other tubers, wine, fish, meat, and oils,\u201d the statistics office said.\n\nThe IMF said on Wednesday that its team, led by Jesmin Rahman, held meetings with the Nigerian authorities from June 6-10, 2022, to discuss recent economic and financial developments, and the economic outlook for the country.\n\nRahman, in a statement at the end of the visit, said economic recovery continued to gain strength on the back of services and agriculture, with GDP growth reaching 3.6 percent year-on-year in Q1 2022.\n\nRead also: How Nigeria can curb high inflation rate\n\nShe said: \u201cLatest data shows economic growth broadening to all sectors except oil, where production remains weak, reflecting continued security and technical challenges.\n\n\u201cInflation has reached 17.7 percent (y/y) in May led by a renewed surge in food prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, and raising food security concerns as over 40 percent of the population live below the poverty line. To contain inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Nigeria has recently hiked its monetary policy rate by 150 basis points to 13 percent.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC), led by economist Bismarck Rewane, had earlier predicted that the country\u2019s inflation rate would hit 17.72 percent in May, saying a survey showed that commodity prices were increasing at a faster pace for food items than in the non-food basket.\n\nThey said this reflected the combined effects of seasonality, output shocks and war-induced global supply chain disruptions.\n\n\u201cFlour and diesel are major cost components in the baking of bread, accounting for 70 percent and 15 percent of the total costs. The price of flour and diesel spiked by 76.7 percent and 209.37 percent to N26,500/bag and N750/litre respectively in the last year. This is likely to push upwards the price of a loaf of bread from N600 two months ago to N900,\u201d they said.\n\nThe FDC analysts said in spite of the price surge, wages had remained static or even declined in real terms.\n\nThey said: \u201cConsequently, price resistance of consumers is increasing and many are switching to affordable substitutes. In some cases, as is empirically evident, we have noticed a drop in the quantity of goods demanded. Since price inflation is not a Nigeria specific phenomenon, there are indications that the price spiral is not likely to be short-lived.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces a major food crisis as insecurity escalates. The Nigerian economy is now at the verge of a major food crisis as killings and kidnappings become the order of the day.\u201d\n\nAccording to FDC, with insecurity on the rise, farmers could be cautious of going to the farm, resulting in lower harvest and ultimately reduced exports.\n\nInflationary pressures were felt more in the urban areas of the country in May than in the rural areas. Urban inflation rate rose to 18.24 percent in May as against 17.35 percent in April, while rural inflation increased to 17.21 percent from 16.32 percent.\n\nRead also:Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate hits 17.7%, highest in 11 months\n\n\u201cThe increase in inflation was driven by persistent structural factors and the base year effect. For households, the rising inflationary environment would lead to lower discretionary expenses while negative real interest rates on investment are expected to widen\u201d, Omobola Adu, an investment research analyst with Afrinvest Consulting, said.\n\nThe ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the displacement of farmers by herders and insurgents in Nigeria have been identified as major drivers of the uptick in the prices of food items. The conflict has disrupted the supply chains of commodities such as wheat, sugar and vegetable oil.\n\nIn April, prices of food items in Nigeria rose by 28.86 percent on the average on a year-on-year basis. Prices of tomatoes rose by 53.86 percent in April, according to the NBS. Groundnut and vegetable oil prices rose by 46.21 and 45.85 percent respectively in the same month. The prices of bread and wheat-related products rose by 35.3 percent on the average, just as those of yam tubers, beans, and maize increased by 42.88 percent, 40.07 percent, and 27.6 respectively.\n\n\u201cPrices of poultry feeds have sent some of our members out of business. Not only that, transport fare for moving poultry feeds from Ibadan to Ogun State has risen by 100 percent. When I started, I paid N30,000 as transport fare, but now I pay N60,000 for moving the same bags of feed. We cannot transfer all these costs to our clients\u201d, Adedapo Adetola, CEO of Agrodam Farms Limited in Ogun State, said.\n\nThe NBS said the country\u2019s core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce, increased by 14.90 percent in May, the highest in almost five years, from 14.18 percent in April.\n\nThe highest increases were recorded in prices of gas, liquid fuel, garment, solid fuel, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing and passenger transport by road.\n\n\u201cThis is a sharp increase can be linked to foreign exchange (FX) illiquidity in the market,\u201d said Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst. \u201cIf you look at the FX movement in the parallel market, you will discover that there is a serious liquidity challenge, of which FX was being devoted to election activities that is why that $1 is around N600-N610.\u201d\n\n\u201cWheat, sugar, salt, gas and diesel are things that you need to produce bread. I started my bakery business in March 2022 with some assumptions. All of them are no longer realistic,\u201d Olayiwola Babatunde, CEO of Minarets Pharmacy Limited Ibadan, said.\n\n\u201cThe price of 50kg of wheat flour rose from N20,500 in March to N26,500 now. A 50kg gas cylinder in March was N33,000 but now costs N38,000. The same thing applies to sugar, salt and diesel. When we raised the issue of price adjustment, it caused a lot of customer attrition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you pass all the costs to your customers, they will run away. And in my case, I cannot afford to reduce the quality of my cakes. So, the sacrifice is my margin as we only charge a margin that makes us remain in business. The pressure is too much,\u201d Zaynab Adetipe-Salaam, creative director at HeartyKrafts Cakes, said.\n\n\u2018Further interest rate hike likely\u2019\n\nThe surge in inflation rate has also led to the expectation of a further increase in the Monetary Policy Rate when the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next month. In May, the committee increased the benchmark interest rate to 13.5 percent from 11.5 percent, for the first time since July 2016.\n\n\u201cThe MPC stance will be hinged on the June and July inflation numbers. A continuous increase in price level (which is very likely) to about 18 to 19 percent would mean the MPC could push policy rate up by at least 50 basis percentage points,\u201d Temitope Omosuyi, investment strategy analyst at Afrinvest Limited, said.\n\n\u201cMore so, both the money and capital markets have not significantly responded to the previous rate hike and various macroeconomic indicators that underscored the decision have not improved at all.\u201d\n\nLondon-based Capital Economics said the latest inflation reading out of Nigeria showed \u201canother chunky rise in the headline rate will keep the central bank under pressure to continue raising interest rates\u201d.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers only delivered their first interest rate hike in May, but the latest inflation print means that another rise in the benchmark rate is nailed on,\u201d Virag Forizs, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said.\n\nBut Gbolahan Ologunro, a senior research analyst at Cordros Securities is of the view that the MPC would still maintain the present rate.\n\n\u201cThe CBN governor is trying to take into account the impact of interest rate hikes on economic goods. So, if they decide to be aggressive by pushing up interest rates, that may impact on credits going to the private sector which will have an impact on the overall economic activities,\u201d he said.\n\nDangote refinery, revenue mobilisation could spur inclusive growth \u2013 IMF\n\nThe IMF said the start of operations at the Dangote refinery and decisive steps to mobilise revenue could spur economic growth in the country.\n\nIt said the country\u2019s current account deficit narrowed significantly in 2021 helped by import compression and higher net oil balance.\n\n\u201cHowever, the improving trade balance, which has continued so far in 2022, is having a limited impact on foreign exchange strains with the exchange rate premiums in the parallel market staying in the 35-40 percent range since October 2021,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Washington-based fund said despite supportive oil prices, gross FX reserves fell to $38.6 billion at end-May 2022, having reached $41.5 billion in September 2021 boosted by SDR allocation and Eurobond issuance.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain high at 6.1 percent of GDP due in great measure to costly petrol subsidies and limited tax revenue collections. Downside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, elections, low vaccination against Covid-19 and higher global interest rates.\n\n\u201cOn the upside, steady private sector recovery and further broadening of growth, the start of operations at the Dangote refinery and decisive steps to mobilise revenues, in line with the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative could spur inclusive growth and development.\u201d",

          "text": "The gubernatorial election coming up in Ekiti State on Saturday is expected to test the readiness of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the 2023 general election.\n\nIn July 2018, when the last gubernatorial election held in the state, the exercise witnessed late arrival of materials, logistics problems and violence.\n\nThere were also alleged cases of vote-buying and voter intimidation. About 30,000 policemen were deployed along with hundreds of security personnel from other agencies.\n\nKayode Fayemi, who initially ruled the state from 2010-2014, returned as governor of the state in 2018. Fayemi, who was controversially defeated by his predecessor, Ayo Fayose, in 2014, is expected to complete his second tenure on October 16, 2022.\n\nAccording to INEC, 16 political parties are presenting candidates for the gubernatorial election.\n\nThere are 16 local government areas in the state.\n\nRead also: How credible Anambra, Ekiti, and Osun guber polls will affect 2023 election\n\nAhead of Saturday\u2019s election, observers have expressed fear about INEC\u2019s readiness to eliminate the bottlenecks that characterised Anambra State\u2019s gubernatorial election in November last year or prevent a repeat of what happened on July 14, 2018 in Ekiti.\n\nThere are fears among stakeholders that issues such as insecurity, logistic failure, vote buying and voter apathy, which characterised recent elections in Nigeria in the last two decades, could recur.\n\nThe Ekiti gubernatorial poll will be the first election to be conducted under the current Amended Electoral Act, and the second state election to be conducted using the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System.\n\nObservers say that the election would be a litmus test for INEC on how prepared the commission is for the general election next year, and would also be an opportunity to assess the role of security agencies and commitment of parties to electoral integrity.\n\nKunle Okunola, a political analyst, said: \u201cThe election would play a key role in making Nigerians have confidence in the electoral body. That is, how effective and efficient INEC in the Ekiti election would determine the level of trust and confidence Nigerians would have in the body.\n\n\u201cINEC should do everything possible to stop vote-buying during the election. The body should ensure that its machines are in good shape for the conduct of the election.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BusinessDay , Ajayi, who is the candidate of the YPP, expressed the optimism that the commission would deliver on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re promising free, fair, credible, safe elections but I wonder if their level of readiness to fulfil that promise as tension is very high. I am really not monitoring them closely. But I wonder if they\u2019re ready for the many farmsteads in Ekiti,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the leading candidates are Oluwole Oluyede of Action Democratic Congress, Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Olabisi Kolawole of People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Segun Oni of Social Democratic Party (SDP), and Ranti Ajayi of Young Progressives Party.\n\nThere are two female candidates: Kemi Josephine Elebute-Halle of Action Democratic Congress, and Christianah Modupe Olatawura of Action Peoples Party.\n\nPundits and political watchers say that the contest would be a three-horse race between Oyebanji, Kolawole and Oni, a former governor of the state.\n\nThis would be so largely due to the candidates\u2019 popularity, structure across the state, and their financial strength, which had become critical towards winning election in the current democratic setting in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, just like any other election, it is expected that the smaller political parties and their candidates would go into an alliance with the bigger parties, whose candidates have a brighter chance of doing well at the poll.\n\nThe incumbent governor, Fayemi, is supporting the APC candidate, Oyebanji, while his predecessor, Ayo Fayose, is supporting his godson, Kolawole.\n\nThe involvement of the three political heavyweights, Fayemi, Fayose and Oni, has made the situation across the state tense ahead of Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nRead also: 6 parties to feature in Ekiti LG poll\n\nFayemi and Fayose, who were presidential aspirants in the recently concluded APC and PDP presidential primaries, are doing all they can to win the election for their respective parties ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nOni, who was once a member of the PDP and APC, had dumped the PDP for SDP after failing in his bid to win the PDP ticket.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last few days, the election has been generating interest among observers, across the state and within Nigeria.\n\nThere is apprehension among stakeholders and political leaders on the outcome of the poll.\n\nUnlike in the past, the campaign by political parties and their candidates have been relatively peaceful.",

Barau, I. Jibrin (Kano North).\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, for any country to achieve meaningful development, the socio economic and political system must be enhanced. This is why successive Nigerian governments placed much emphases on the development of the individual as a means to national development. Education is the sure means of developing individual potentials.\n\nSenator Barau pointed out that the National Policy on Education (1981) postulates that education is \u201cthe greatest investment that the nation can make for the quick development of its economic, political, sociological and human resources.\u201d Among the various educational institutions through which the nation hopes to achieve its developmental goals, specialized Universities of Education should take pre-eminence because they are set up to train the trainers.\n\n\u201cThe development of a sound and robust educational system in any country is therefore predicated on the availability of qualified and well trained teachers to impact the required knowledge on the students.\u201d\n\n\u201d Thus, the need to have a strong system in our educational sector that shall continuously produce well qualified and trained teachers as is obtainable in other countries cannot be overemphasized. This is the fundamental justification for the establishment of this specialized institution of higher learning: the Federal University of Education (Technical) Bichi.\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the realization that Universities of Education are tools for national development have led to an unbridled quest for and vigorous expansion of such institutions in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe outlined the objectives of the University in the Bill among others to include:\n\nThe encouragement of the advancement of learning to all persons without distinction of race, creed, sex or political conviction.\n\nThe develop and offer academic, technical and professional programmes leading to the award of certificates, first degrees, post graduate research, diploma and higher degrees with emphasis on planning, developmental and adaptive skills in Education. Engineering, Technology, Applied science. Agriculture, Commerce, Arts, Social science, Humanities, Management and Allied professional disciplines.\n\nTo produce socially mature educational men and women with capabilities not to only understand the educational and technological needs of Nigeria as a nation, but also to exploit existing Educational infrastructure and improve on them to develop new ones.\n\nTo act as agents and catalysts for effective Educational system, through post graduate training, research and innovation, for effective economic utilization and conservation of the country\u2019s human and material resources.\n\nTo bring quality change in Technical Education by focusing on teacher Education, through teaching and learning innovations.\n\nAlso, to collaborate with other national and international educational institutions involved in training, research and development of Education, with a view towards promoting governance, leadership and management skills among Educational managers and to provide and promote sound basic Education training as a foundation for the development of Nigeria, taking into account indigenous culture and the need to enhance national unity.\n\nThe lawmaker also in compliance with Order 76(3) of the Standing Rules of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria with respect to the procedure of Bills, Compendium and Consolidation, gave the compilation of the summary of the anticipated recurrent and capital expenditure in the first twelve months following the commencement of this Act.\n\nFEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION (TECHNICAL) BICHI\n\nTOTAL:\n\nTOTAL ALLOCATION:\n\nPERSONNEL COST SALARY:\n\nSALARIES AND WAGES CONSOLIDATED SALARY\n\n1,126,529,588\n\n1,126,529 588\n\n237,640.699\n\n655,60,621\n\n655.680.621\n\n655,680,621\n\n81.960,078\n\n81,960,078\n\nALLOWANCES AND SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION: ALLOWANCES\n\nNON REGULAR ALLOWANCES:\n\nFOREIGN SERVICE ALLOWANCE\n\n32,784,031\n\n49.176.047\n\n277.3727.778\n\nTOTAL GOODS AND NON-PERSONAL SERVICES GENERAL OVERHEAD COST\n\nTRAVELE TRANSPORT GENERAL\n\nLOCAL TRAVEL & TRANSPORT: TRAINING:\n\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCONSTRUCTION/PROVISION\n\nCONSTRUCTION/PROVISION OF FIXED ASSETS-GENERAL CONSTRUCTION/ PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE:\n\n277.777.378\n\n717,540,699\n\nTOTAL PERSONNEL\n\nTOTAL OVERHEAD TOTAL RECURRENT\n\nTOTAL CAPITAL\n\nTOTAL ALLOCATION:\n\n848 751.810\n\n277,777,278\n\n1, 126, 529,588\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The state defeated 22 other beneficiary states to clinch the national award.\n\nEdo State also came out tops in two other categories, including Best in Disbursement/Engineering/Civil Works/Bio-Engineering and Best in Counterpart Funding. These are in addition to coming as runner-up in several other categories. The honour is the highest winning by any state out of the 23 NEWMAP participating states.\n\nThe Edo NEWMAP Project Coordinator, while briefing journalists, on Wednesday, said the honour is on the back of the support of the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who has spared no resources in positively impacting the lives of residents, in line with his government\u2019s vision of making Edo great again.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe efforts and commitment of the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki at implementing infrastructural renewal and sustainable development initiatives in Edo earned NEWMAP in the state the rain of awards at the just-concluded closing/valedictory session for the NEWMAP project in Abuja.\n\n\u201cEdo State came out tops in three (3) categories, which is the highest winning by any state out of the 23 NEWMAP participating states. The categories are best overall performing state; best in Disbursement/Engineering/Civil Works/Bio-Engineering, and best in Counterpart Funding. These are in addition to coming as runner up in several other categories.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cIt is on record that Edo State NEWMAP accounted for about 17 percent of the overall success of NEWMAP in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEdo NEWMAP paid over N3.2bn as counterpart fund, which is over twice more than the nearest contributing state and over 17 percent of the total counterpart paid under NEWMAP.\u201d\n\nThe project coordinator added, \u201cThe Edo-NEWMAP under the leadership of Governor Obaseki built a total length of over 40kms of secondary drains. This is in addition to the over 14kms of primary stormwater culverts, drains, and over 4km of earth stormwater channels, among other projects to check flood and improve the livelihoods of Edo people.\n\n\u201cGovernor Obaseki is serious about frontally tackling the environmental challenges of the state and his commitment to ensuring durable infrastructure to prevent further erosion and destruction of public and private infrastructure and potential agricultural land earned Edo NEWMAP the accolades which it recently received from the World Bank.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Barely 24 hours to the deadline issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission, the bid to get a running mate for presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has been narrowed down to the North East and North West.\n\nWhile Tinubu and the governing party may likely unveil the party\u2019s vice presidential candidate today, it was gathered that as of last night, interested members from the two geopolitical zones, including state governors, were still engaged in intense lobbying to become running mate to the APC standard bearer.\n\nThis is even as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will screen its vice presidential candidate today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere were also feelers that the APC may have favoured the North East zone to produce Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\nA presidency source told this paper that President Muhammadu Buhari and Tinubu yesterday met behind closed doors to conclude on who emerges as running mate to the former Lagos State governor.\n\nLEADERSHIP had reported yesterday that while Tinubu holds the ace in respect of the choice of his running mate for the 2023 presidential election, he has to factor in the position of the governing party, which is to take into considerations all the indices that would promote fairness and unity of the country in his choice of a running mate.\n\nImo State governor, Hope Uzodimma, had told State House correspondents after meeting with President Buhari that the decision of a running mate lies with Tinubu.\n\nSome of party members scrambling for the VP position in the North West and North East are Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai; his Kano and Kebbi counterparts, Abdullahi Ganduje; Jigawa State governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and Atiku Bagudu.\n\nOthers are secretary to government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; former Borno State governor, Ibrahim Shettima; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; former secretary to government of the federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, and a new entrant, Dr. Ibrahim Bello Dauda.\n\nDauda, a former secretary of the Buhari Support Group (BSG) and an ally of the president during the All Nigerian People\u2019s Party (ANPP) era, is said to also be in the mix since he is from Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) block.\n\nDauda, a management consultant from Borno State, is said to have the support of party chieftains, especially the CPC bloc since the New PDP and the ACN have taken the National Chairman and Presidential ticket respectively.\n\nPlateau State governor, Simon Lalong, from the North Central is among those being considered for the VP slot.\n\nThere are also unconfirmed reports that the leadership of the APC may have settled for Senator Binta Masi Garba, a former senator as running mate to Tinubu.\n\nShe is from the North East and also a Christian who has won elections in Kaduna State as well as Adamawa State.\n\nSenator Garba who was on Channels Television (Politics Today) last night, made a strong case for a female vice president, saying she is ready and qualified to be the running mate to Tinubu.\n\nShe noted that it has been her ambition to become the vice president of the country and if the time is now she is ready to do the job, even as she said the APC should give the ticket to a woman, just as she is well ready to be the woman.\n\nIf she gets the slot to run with Tinubu in the general election and APC goes ahead to win the election, Binta would become the very first woman in Nigeria to clinch that position.\n\nTinubu, while reacting to rumours of picking a Muslim as his running mate, had hinted at picking a Northern Christian as his running mate.\n\nAddressing journalists at the APC governorship rally in Ekiti State, Tinubu dispelled rumours of a Muslim-Muslim ticket, saying those spreading the rumours carriers are undemocratic elements that are already threatened by his impending victory in the coming presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe VP slot belongs to the Northeastern region and particularly the Christians, but consultations are yet ongoing as to who will be decided,\u201d he declared.\n\nTinubu assured Nigerians that no group, institution or person can impose a running mate on him.\n\nAPC Youths Rally Support For Boss Mustapha\n\nAlso, the APC Consolidated Network (APCCN) yesterday made a case for the secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, to clinch the party\u2019s vice president slot.\n\nThe group, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its national coordinator,\n\nBarr Mahmud Afegbua, and secretary general, Engr Sylvia Onu, after the executive meeting in Abuja, argued that Mustapha\u2019s antecedents singled him out among others.\n\nTinubu\u2019s Deftness In Politics Won Him APC Presidential Ticket \u2013 Bamisile\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 stated that the choice of Mustapha, a devoted Christian, as clamoured by APC stakeholders would further boost the candidature of the party\u2019s front-liner, Tinubu, and give the ruling party a higher leverage in the polls.\n\n\u201cWe know the person of Boss Mustapha over the years; we are also abreast of his capabilities and political acceptability across the borders. He championed the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 and the exercise was a huge success. We also commended him for always playing a supportive role in the policies of the Federal Government. His emergence will give APC an edge of emerging victorious in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition PDP will today screen its vice presidential candidates.\n\nThe PDP leadership yesterday set up an advisory committee to screen its vice presidential candidates.\n\nThe committee is led by former minister of external affairs, High Chief Tom Ikimi.\n\nThe committee was set up barely a day after Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, was picked by some party leaders as the running mate to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar who emerged the party\u2019s presidential candidate in May.\n\nAlthough the position has not been made official, sources at the meeting told LEADERSHIP that Wike emerged a preferred candidate of the majority of the stakeholders at the meeting which was held on Tuesday as the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\nHowever, a statement by the national publicity secretary of PDP, Hon Debo Ologunagba, noted: \u201cPursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the Electoral Guidelines of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the nomination of the following Party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated Vice Presidential Candidate of our Party for the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nThe members of the Committee are High Chief Tom Ikimi \u2013 Chairman; H.E. Capt. Idris I. Wada (rtd) \u2013 Member; Chief Osita Chidoka \u2013 Member; Rt. Hon. Binta Bello \u2013 Member; Chief Mrs. Alh. Mutiat Adedoja \u2013 Member; Hon Austin Opara \u2013 Member; Prof Aisha Madawaki \u2013 Member.\n\nOthers are Mrs Ayotunde George-Ologun \u2013 Member; Chief Mrs Chidiebelu Mofus \u2013 Member; H.E. Fidelis Tapgun \u2013 Member; Dr Akilu Indabawa- Secretary; and Mr. Sunday Omobo \u2013 administrative secretary.\n\nOlogunagba stated that the screening exercise for the candidate will hold at the party\u2019s national secretariat today.\n\nMeanwhile, a pan northern group under the auspices of Arewa Youth Awareness Forum (AYAF) has declared its support for the proposed pairing of Atiku and Wike for the election.\n\nThe group said Atiku and Wike as presidential candidate and running mate respectively will win the 2023 presidential race without stress.\n\nIn a statement yesterday signed by the group\u2019s chairman, vice-chairman and secretary-general, Mohammed Sani-Kabir, Salisu Abdurrahaman and Ben Alege respectively, the group emphasised that they pairing has the capacity to roll back poverty, insecurity, illiteracy and other indices of underdevelopment.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe applaud the choice of Governor Wike whose numerous passionate infrastructural projects in Rivers State have been commissioned by eminent persons across the federation, including our revered Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar.\n\n\u201cIn view of deep-rooted economic, security and other challenges of nation-building that the nation faces today, one thing that is more needed than religious and ethnic sentiments is good, impactful governance characterised by mass inclusion and leadership that has capacity to move mountains.\u201d",

          "text": "The House of Representatives yesterday resolved to move a motion to override President Muhammadu Buhari for failing to assent to Clause 58(8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\n\nThe lawmakers representing Ethiope federal constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ben Igbakpa, at the plenary yesterday raised a constitutional point of order, citing section 58 (8) of the 1999 constitution which empowered the National Assembly to enact laws and also override the president with two-thirds majority of the members\u2019 vote.\n\nIgbakpa, who was among the lawmakers that lost out in the just concluded primaries, said there was no need for the House to fear anyone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe, therefore, urged his colleagues to rise up, take the pen, collect signatures and override President Buhari and give Nigerians the enabling electoral law.\n\nAddressing the leadership of the House, he said: \u201cOn the 11th of May, with your colleagues, you brought all of us back from our various constituencies so that we can work on the electoral act, as amended. Graciously that was done on the 11th of May. And by 12th, this amendment was transmitted to Mr. President. Mr. President did not just ignore, he travelled out of the country on a condolence visit to Dubai and that created a lot of problems for the country. Nigerians are crying for good leadership and the leadership recruitment process starts with our primaries.\n\n\u201cYou have worked hard and that is why I took us to Section 58. We are to make laws and present them to Mr President, and where he does not sign, that same Section 58 gives us the powers to make sure that we pass that law without Mr. President\u2019s assent. There\u2019s nowhere that is said that one arm of government is subservient to the other,\u201d adding that after it tenure Nigerians will remember the House leadership for the good work it had done.\n\nHe further insisted that the legislature cannot continue to act as if it was under the executive arm of government.\n\nHe went on: \u201cThis Constitution gave us the powers just as it gave to them. We must wake up as a Parliament where we pass our laws, and we are sure we have done the right thing we should start overriding Mr. President because this is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Act came into being because the parliament, which the Speaker was part of, overrode President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nWhat are we afraid of? Mr. President has not committed an offence, what he has done is the rule of law and the Constitution and I believe by the time we do our own by overriding veto, we would not have committed any offence.\n\n\u201cW we will be working according to the constitution and the rule of law. This parliament must stamp their feet and tell Nigerians that we are working for them and not for the party or any individual.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the deputy minority leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, had said that the electoral act had been weaponised, calling for activation of relevant Constitutional powers to address the lacuna.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong in an environment, in an institution where the two leaders of the Senate would have to cross to other parties because of inherent inclement conditions.\n\n\u201cAnything that occasions it, anything that warrants it, if it is our Electoral Act, if it is our politics, if it is the environment where we operate, we need to retool. And like you said, we got to do better work and we have to fight on. For me, it is just a battle that is lost, the war is on and we should go ahead to make sure that law is retooled, made clear. And if it requires this parliament to take action to override what has not been signed, we should be willing to do so,\u201d Okechukwu said.\n\nIn his ruling, the Speaker Gbajabiamila, who affirmed that the president was in breach of the 30 days provided to communicate his decision to withhold assent, urged Hon. Igbakpa to formally present a motion in that regard.\n\n\u201cClearly the Constitution says it is 30 days\u2019 leeway and we have gone beyond the 30 days. But the Constitution also says that it is not automatic that you override, but if you are convinced as a House that that amendment must stand.\n\n\u201cIf you are not convinced with the argument advanced by the president or in some cases \u2013 and in this case, there are no arguments advanced, then you can override. But for us to override I believe you need the required two-thirds, and it cannot be by voice votes.\n\n\u201cSo, what I will suggest is that you bring the application, the formal motion notice, perhaps tomorrow \u2013 whenever you are able to do that \u2013 and we will determine whether or not this House is ready to override or not, I think that\u2019s the proper procedure,\u201d Gbajabiamila said.",
          "summary": "The House of Representatives yesterday resolved to move a motion to override President Muhammadu Buhari for failing to assent to Clause 58(8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\nADVERTISEMENTHe, therefore, urged his colleagues to rise up, take the pen, collect signatures and override President Buhari and give Nigerians the enabling electoral law.\nAnd by 12th, this amendment was transmitted to Mr. President.\nToby Okechukwu, had said that the electoral act had been weaponised, calling for activation of relevant Constitutional powers to address the lacuna.\n\u201cAnything that occasions it, anything that warrants it, if it is our Electoral Act, if it is our politics, if it is the environment where we operate, we need to retool.",

We need to put our resources together and improve the Nigeria Police, so that what happened in Owo should not happen in other places.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Senator Istifanus Gyang (PDP, Plateau North), blamed the attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on religious extremism.\n\nHe urged religious leaders in the country to desist from inciting their followers through religious messages preached in places of worship, adding that doing otherwise poses great security threat to the country.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, said, \u201cThis is one sad event that took place, and we are all united in grief.\n\n\u201cOne thing that is so imperative is for security agencies to continue to protect our citizens, and where we encounter breeches, the perpetrators must be fished out and then the law takes its full course.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, in its resolutions, accordingly, urged security agencies to intensify efforts to investigate the matter with the aim of bringing perpetrators to book and as well deploy drones and helicopters to monitor forests and ungoverned areas in Nigeria, to identify illegal camps of armed bandits throughout the country.\n\nThe chamber urged for collaboration amongst her various security agencies on intelligence gathering and sharing in very discreet and organised form, at local government and state levels, and nationwide.\n\nIt also commiserated with the families of the victims, the Catholic Church, the people and government of Ondo State.\n\nThe chamber also observed a minute silence in memory of the victims killed during the attack.usly create criminal offences as the document states unequivocally that any platform or internet intermediary responsible for violating its provisions will be liable to prosecution and conviction.\u201d\n\nHe argued that NITDA\u2019s misuse of the term \u201cCode of Practice\u201d to describe the document amounts to acting under false pretences to dupe Nigerians into believing that the government is seeking to protect them when its real intention is so obviously to control social media and other internet platforms by compelling them to register with the government and thereby muzzle the right to freedom of expression online.\n\nLonge contended that the document is a breach of Articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Nigeria\u2019s treaty obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which gives everyone the right to freedom of expression, including the \u201cfreedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers\u2026.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe name is problematic. Although it is termed a code of practice, it is in fact not intended to provide guidance for the implementation of any specific law or regulation.\n\n\u201cRather, it creates criminal offences which are not contained in any existing law and attempt to legitimize them by a vague reference to its enabling Act and other laws, which is beyond the remit of any such administrative document.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the underlying rationale and the provisions of the document are unrealistic and unreasonable as they defy logic and common sense.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s globalised world, is it possible or realistic to expect global Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and others to register with the government of every country in the world where they have users and set up offices in all those countries, which is the implication of the federal government\u2019s demand?\n\n\u201cConversely, Nigeria\u2019s external broadcaster, the Voice of Nigeria, broadcasts its signal and content to dozens of countries around the world and runs a website that is accessible globally; is it registered and does it have offices in all the countries where its signals are received as Nigeria is now demanding of platforms registered in other countries?\u201d\n\nHe, however, described many of the provisions of the document as arbitrary and draconian.\n\nHe further said the requirement that platforms take down \u201cunlawful content\u201d within 24 hours after receiving a notice or complaint from any authorised government agency constitutes an attempt by the government to control content published on social media and other online platforms while bypassing the judicial process and usurping the functions of the courts which should legitimately determine what content that is illegal or unlawful.\n\nHe said, MRA therefore, rejected the \u201cCode of Practice\u201d in its totality. It called on the government to abandon it and approach the National Assembly with an appropriate bill if its genuine intention is to address legitimate issues rather than violating the rights of Nigerians and other members of the public on the pretext of protecting them from fake news and misinformation.",

The security outfits only performed their own official duty by intervening in the crisis among the thugs in the PDP. The attempt to blackmail them by the PDP cannot stand, and we urge the public to disregard the lies and propaganda of the sinking party.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, our party does not have any connection with the latest violent attack perpetrated by political thugs loyal to the PDP. The Osun APC remains law-abiding, responsible, peace-loving and we will never resort to violence nor engage in any act capable of disrupting the peace of the State.\n\n\u201cUnlike the PDP, we have been preaching peace and conducting ourselves peacefully since the campaigns began, and this is what we shall continue to do till the day of the election and after the exercise,\u201d Famodun said.",

          "text": "The Premier League 2022-23 season will begin with a London derby as Crystal Palace host Arsenal on August 5, while Erik ten Hag will start his reign at home to Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nIt\u2019s a case of deja-vu for Arsenal who travel across the English capital on a Friday night (8pm kick-off) for the top-flight\u2019s curtain-raiser. They did so last season too, but lost 2-0 at Brentford.\n\nThe Gunners will be looking to atone for their last trip to Selhurst Park, where they were comprehensively beaten 3-0 in April.\n\nTwo days after Arsenal kick-off the season, the focus will shift up north as Ten Hag\u2019s United welcome Brighton to Old Trafford (2pm).\n\nThe Dutchman can expect a rapturous receptions from the Red Devils fan base who will be hoping he can turn around their fortunes after dismal 2021-22.\n\nUnited fans will still be scarred by the 4-0 thumping they took on the south coast last month too.\n\nElsewhere on the opening day of the season, champions Manchester City begin the defence of their Premier League crown at West Ham (August 7, 4.30pm) while title rivals Liverpool travel to newly-promoted Fulham (August 6, 12.30pm).\n\nChampionship play-off winners Nottingham Forest, who return to the top flight after 23 years away, begin their campaign away at Newcastle United (August 6, 3pm) \u2013 who will be hoping they can ride their momentum from the back end of last term into the new one.\n\nBournemouth, who finished second in the Championship behind Fulham, are afforded a home fixture on the opening day as they welcome Aston Villa (August 6, 3pm).\n\nElsewhere on the opening day, there\u2019ll be an interest sub-plot at Goodison Park as Everton boss Frank Lampard faces his old club Chelsea (August 6, 5.30pm).\n\nThere are some mouthwatering fixtures in August beyond the opening round of fixtures.\n\nIn the second week of the season, (currently August 13 although subject to change due to TV) Chelsea face bitter rivals Tottenham \u2013 in an early test of both team\u2019s title credentials.\n\nThen a week later, English football\u2019s two most successful sides clash as Manchester United welcome Liverpool (weekend of August 20).\n\nLiverpool supporters will be going into this clash full of fond memories having thrashed their bitter 5-0 at Old Trafford last season. They then followed that up with a 4-0 win at Anfield later that campaign.\n\nThat is the first true test of Ten Hag\u2019s management with his second game in charge before that away at Brentford (weekend of August 13). His fifth game is away at Leicester (August 30, 7.45pm) and sixth at home to Arsenal (weekend of September 3), in a tricky start.\n\nNearer at the top, City have the kinder fixtures on paper than Liverpool to begin the season and try and build some momentum.\n\nAfter West Ham, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side then face Bournemouth (H), Newcastle United (A), Crystal Palace (H), Nottingham Forest (A) and Aston Villa (A).\n\nIn comparison, after travelling to Fulham; Liverpool face Crystal Palace (H), Manchester United (A), Bournemouth (H), Newcastle United (H), Everton (A).\n\nFulham, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest will be eagerly anticipating their start to the season and they all have tough starts.\n\nFulham\u2019s first six games read Liverpool (H), Wolves (A), Brentford (H), Arsenal (A), Brighton (H) and Tottenham (A).\n\nBournemouth\u2019s are Aston Villa (H), Manchester City (A), Arsenal (A), Liverpool (A), Wolves (H) and Nottingham Forest (A).\n\nAnd Forest begin with Newcastle United (A), West Ham (H), Everton (A), Tottenham (H), Manchester City (A) and Bournemouth (H).\n\nAside from Chelsea vs Tottenham and Everton vs Liverpool (weekend of September 3), the weekend of October 1 is a date to mark as we\u2019re treated to Arsenal vs Tottenham and Manchester City vs Manchester United. Two weeks later for City they head to Liverpool (weekend of October 15).\n\nWith the World Cup taking place in the middle of the season and the season pausing on November 12, the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day with the standout fixtures being Arsenal against West Ham in a London derby and Steven Gerrard\u2019s Aston Villa hosting Liverpool.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Liverpool versus Leicester City catches the eye as Brendan Rodgers returns to his old side.\n\nAnd kicking off 2023 on January 2 currently we have the *small* (it isn\u2019t small) matter of Chelsea entertaining Manchester City.\n\nAs we move into next year, April 1 will prove to be no joke as Manchester City face Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium \u2013 a fixture which is certainly bound to have a bearing on the title race. A week after the Reds then play Arsenal (April 8, 2023) in what could be a pivotal period for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nThe penultimate week of the season is another date to look out for at the top as Manchester City welcome Chelsea (May 20, 2023).\n\nNeutrals will be hoping for a repeat of last season\u2019s drama \u2013 where Manchester City pipped Liverpool to the title thanks to a stunning 3-2 comeback win against Aston Villa.\n\nThis time around Guardiola\u2019s side travel to Brentford, while Liverpool are also on the road \u2013 heading to the south coast and against Southampton (both May 28, 2023 \u2013 4pm).\n\nFor the newly-promoted sides, Nottingham Forest head to Crystal Palace, Bournemouth go to Everton and Fulham travel to Manchester United as Ten Hag concludes his first season at the Old Trafford helm.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "The Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (APC Abia North ), has said the only path to victory for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress ( APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is to pick a Muslim from the North as running mate.\n\nKalu made the declaration Wednesday at a media chat before plenary.\n\nHe said Tinubu, as a Muslim minority from the South, cannot afford to pick a Christian minority from the North.\n\n\u201cElection is about winning the votes where they are. A Muslim from the North will give Tinubu the required votes in the North,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Abia state governor further said Tinubu, being a very liberal minded statesman from the South with an ordained pastor as wife, needed a Muslim from the North for formidable combination.\n\n\u201cChristians should not be agitated about Muslim-Muslim ticket. I am a Catholic and do not see anything wrong with it for the purpose of winning election.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to speak the truth? If I am Bola Ahmed Tinubu whose wife is a senior pastor at a Pentecostal Church, I will go for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is for the party to win. We should stop the issue of whether you put a Christian there or not.\n\n\u201cAfter all if we win, the wife is already a pastor. This is my own opinion, and you cannot deny me my opinion,\u201d he stressed.\n\nKalu also told newsmen that a party could also play Christian-Christian ticket, depending on the scenario.\n\nHe emphasised that it would be almost difficult for the APC to win the election in 2023 if Tinubu does not fly Muslim-Muslim ticket, pointing out that his submissions were not those of the APC, but those of Orji Kalu.\n\n\u201cI sit with Tinubu\u2019s wife in the Senate and the wife is a pastor and I have known Tinubu for long and he is a man who can do the work. Tinubu is not a man who preaches Islam or Christianity.\n\n\u201cHe is a man who goes with everybody and can do the work, I know that most Christians will be hurt with what I am saying, but picking a Muslim or a Christian will not make him the best president,\u201d he added.\n\nPDP NWC receives report, South-East kicks\n\nAnd in a related development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Working Committee (NWC) has received the report of advisory committee that unanimously adopted Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike as the running mate to the party\u2019s 2023 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nBlueprint had reported that the PDP Deputy National Chairman (North) Umar Damagum-led committee Tuesday recommended and settled for Wike as Atiku\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe Rivers state governor was said to have come tops ahead of both Governors Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta state and Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom state.\n\nBlueprint exclusively gathered that members of the NWC led by Senator Iyochia Ayu, Wednesday received the Damagum committee report.\n\nNotwithstanding Wike\u2019s clearance by the Damagum panel, Wike would still have to cross more hurdles.\n\nIt was gathered that since the news broke Tuesday, some leaders of the party had expressed their misgivings at the choice of Wike on account of his conduct and prepared to \u2018pull the rug off his feet.\u2019\n\nIt was learnt that those opposed to Wike\u2019s choice as running mate had uploaded a video of his media interviews now trending where he swore never to take the vice-presidential slot.\n\nSoutheast kicks\n\nBut in the midst of all this, PDP stalwarts from the South-east geopolitical zone are demanding that running mate to Atiku be given to them in the spirit of equity, fairness and balance.\n\nFormer Enugu state Governor Chimaroke Nnamani and former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim are being mentioned in this regard.\n\nA source who spoke to Blueprint said: \u201cGiving the position to South East will usher in peace and harmony in the PDP going into the 2023 elections instead of the south-south that is already a battle field among the aspirants.\u201d\n\nNew committee to screen VP contenders\n\nMeanwhile, the Ayu-led NWC has set up yet another committee to screen the running mate contenders.\n\nThe new committee is headed by former foreign affairs minister, Chief Tom Ikimi while former Kogi state Governor Captain Idris Wada and former aviation minister, Ostia Chidoka are members.\n\nOthers are: Binta Bello, Mutiat Adedoja, Austin Opara, Aisha Madawaki, George Ologun, Chidiebelu Mofus, Fidelis Tapgun and Akilu Indabawa who will serve as secretary.\n\nThe committee meets Thursday (today) for the screening exercise.\n\nA statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba said the National Working Committee (NWC) set up the committee pursuant to part V1, paragraph 14 of the Electoral Guidelines of the Party.\n\nWhile the statement was silent on who the contenders were, Ologunagba said the party was still consulting and yet to take a position.\n\n\u2018INEC waiting\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has expressed the hope that the political parties would meet its set deadline by Friday.\n\nWhen our reporter contacted the officials of the commission for an update on submission of running mate nominees Wednesday, one of them said: \u201cI don\u2019t have it with me here now. Why don\u2019t you wait till Friday? Maybe INEC will issue a statement on the matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman Rotimi Oyekanmi specifically said: \u201cYou have to wait until after the deadline has passed before you can get the accurate number. Some might submit on the last day.\u201d\n\nAlso, the National Commissioner and chairman Information and Voter Education, Barrister Festus Okoye, already in Ekiti state for the governorship election at the time of this report said: \u201cMy brother, I\u2019m still in Ekiti. I don\u2019t have information relating to the submissions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

They include: inadequate brokerage services to policyholders, poor claims handling service, price based competition among players, lack of innovative products that meet customer\u2019s needs, concentration of operations in few locations, focus on big ticket businesses, as well as poor distribution channels and skills.\u201d\n\nHe said the theme for the retreat \u201cBusiness Strategy for Sustainability \u2013 Personal Mastery and Self Leadership\u201d couldn\u2019t have come at a better time than now that we have to look beyond all the challenges we are facing as a sector, economy, nation and the globe.\n\nNAICOM CEO enjoined the CEOs of broking firms to continually explore ways with other stakeholders to facilitate economic prosperity; ensure environmental sustainability and social development to drive long term sustainable growth in the Nigerian insurance industry for the overall lasting benefits to the society, pertinent to our national and institutional growth.\n\nHe also emphasised that the insurance industry as a business is not outside of the same pressures as businesses in other industry or sectors.\n\nThomas listed some of the initiatives of the Commission to include: reaching out to the state governments, reaching out to Agencies of government, enhancing its technology infrastructure, as well as binging the Nigerian insurance industry into the mainstream of continental and global relevance.\n\nHe reiterated NAICOM\u2019s commitment to continuous development and growth of the Nigerian insurance sector thus, always prepared to collaborate with all stakeholders in promoting and entrenching good business strategies for sustainability of the Nigerian Insurance Industry.",

His records of achievement as a Local Government Chairman, Chief of Staff to the Rivers State Governor, Minister of State for Education, currently Governor of Rivers State and the runner-up in the PDP Presidential Primary stand him out as possessing requisite qualities, qualifications, capacity and wide acceptability for the position of the Vice-Presidential candidate of our Party.\n\n\u201cThe various positions creditably held by Governor Nyesom Wike distinguished him as an excellent team player in public governance.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Governor Wike\u2019s energy, brilliance, commitment and passion were acknowledged by the National Working Committee (NWC) of our Party and he is adjudged as the foremost candidate in consideration for the position of the Vice-Presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWhile the PDP notes the interest of the media and the public in our Party\u2019s choice of Vice-Presidential candidate it is imperative to state that as an organic Party, all our processes will be followed through in strict adherence to our procedures before any official announcements.\n\n\u201cThe PDP urges Nigerians to disregard the mischievous reports aimed at undermining our Party\u2019s unity at this critical time.\u201d",

And when we have such a situation, when the pensioner complains, we ask them to send us their statement of accounts, so that we can confirm that that payment didn\u2019t go through.\n\n\u201cIf he (Abiodun Michael) says 18,000 pensioners have not been paid, it means that PTAD has a bias for Lagos state pensioners. Why is it that the other pensioners from other states all over the federation are not making the same complaints?\n\n\u201cThese are pockets of complaints and we are addressing them. This is a system, it\u2019s technology, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\n\n\u201cI have apologised to the pensioners about the three month arrears.

Matthew Hassan Kukah.\n\nThe accord was signed by the eleven candidates vying for the post.\n\nDuring the event, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Prof. Mahmood Yakubu expressed gratitude to the NPC for the initiative, saying it has been fruitful.\n\n\u201cSince the Edo State Gov. election held in September 2020, followed by the Ondo State Gov. election in October 2020 & the Anambra State Gov. election in November 2021, political parties & candidates have signed the Peace Accord under the auspices of the National Peace Committee,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe intervention of the Peace Committee no doubt contributed in no small way to the peaceful conduct of previous Governorship elections.

          "text": "Ukraine said it urgently needed more weapons to fend off Russian advances in the south and the east, an appeal aimed at the West as the leaders of Germany, France and Italy headed to Kyiv by night train for a visit on Thursday.\n\nRussia has focused most of its firepower on the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk while also trying to consolidate control over southern territory encompassing the strategic city of Kherson, north of the Black Sea.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are fighting to retake ground in wheat fields and empty villages along a deserted motorway between the city of Mykolaiv and Russian-occupied Kherson.\n\nMajor-General Dmytro Marchenko, who leads Ukraine\u2019s forces in Mykolaiv, said his troops could achieve victory over Russia if they are given the right weapons.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that this will not end soon. But then again, if we are given all the weapons that we need, the counter-offensive could well be over by the end of the summer,\u201d Marchenko told U.S.-backed broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nKherson fell to Russian forces in March, soon after Moscow invaded on Feb. 24 in what it describes as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies call this a baseless pretext for a war that his killed thousands and uprooted millions.\n\nSIEVIERDONETSK\n\nAfter being pushed back from the outskirts of Kyiv in May, Russia\u2019s troops have focused their efforts on capturing the entirety of the Donbas, an industrial region where fighting has focused in recent weeks on Sievierodonetsk, now largely in ruins.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears intent on asserting complete control over the Donbas, parts of which are held by Moscow-backed separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.\n\nBut British military intelligence said in a briefing note that Russian forces in the region were believed to be operating in an increasingly \u201cad hoc\u201d way in undermanned groups.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up alongside civilians in a Sievierodonetsk chemical plant ignored a Russian ultimatum to lay down their arms on Wednesday. The city\u2019s mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, says Ukrainian troops were still defending the city, even though all of its river bridges had been destroyed.\n\nUkraine says more than 500 civilians, including 40 children, remain alongside soldiers inside the Azot chemical factory, sheltering from weeks of Russian bombardment. Separatists in the area say up to 1,200 civilians may be inside.\n\nRussia said it had opened a humanitarian corridor from Azot on Wednesday to allow civilians to escape territory it controls. It accused Ukraine\u2019s forces of disrupting that plan and using civilians as human shields, which Kyiv denies.\n\nSerhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Ukraine\u2019s army was defending Sievierodonetsk and trying to stop Russian forces from taking its twin city Lysychansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river.\n\nBritish military intelligence said that with all main bridges destroyed, Russian forces would have to conduct a \u201ccontested\u201d crossing of the river.\n\nA Russian air-launched rocket hit a suburb of the northern city of Sumy overnight, killing four and wounding six, the governor said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify battlefield accounts.\n\nARMS PACKAGES\n\nLeaders including U.S. President Joe Biden have announced new arms packages for Ukraine in recent days, following appeals by Kyiv for help.\n\nBiden pledged $1 billion worth of new aid on Wednesday, including anti-ship rocket systems, artillery rockets and rounds for howitzers.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \u201cextremely focused on stepping up support\u201d for Ukraine.\n\nWhile Ukraine has welcomed the new pledges, it says deliveries are not coming fast enough.\n\nRecent deliveries of M777 howitzers from the United States have been too few and that Ukraine remains numerically outgunned, officials said.\n\nWeapons provisions are likely to dominate discussions during Friday\u2019s visit to Kyiv by leaders of the European Union\u2019s three biggest countries.\n\nThe visit by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has taken weeks to organise with the three looking to overcome criticism within Ukraine over their response to the war.\n\nDetails of the trip were not announced for security reasons but Ukraine\u2019s state rail company head posted a picture of Macron, Scholz, and Draghi on a train used for high-profile visitors. \u201cI was not the only one to spend last night on a train,\u201d he wrote in a message.\n\nThe French presidential office confirmed that Marcon was due in Kyiv on Thursday. Speaking in Romania on Wednesday, Macron said it was time for Europe to reassure Ukraine over its EU ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe are at a point when we need to send clear political signals, us Europeans, towards Ukraine and its people when it is resisting heroically,\u201d he said, without giving details.\n\nOn Friday, the European Commission is due to make a recommendation on Ukraine\u2019s status as an EU candidate.\n\nDespite the state of relations between Russia and the United States, the two powers must discuss the extension of the START nuclear arms reduction treaty, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the RIA news agency in an interview on Thursday.",

He, however, expressed concerns over the spate of terrorism in some countries which has led to humanitarian crises in the affected countries.\n\nThe ECOWAS Commission\u2019s President said just like how maritime insecurity was addressed, early warning mechanisms among other initiatives would be emplaced to tackle the menace of terrorism.\n\nHe said: \u201cObviously, the fight against terrorism is a priority and it is being implemented.\n\n\u201cIt comes to strengthen the various actions carried out in the various countries above all it comes to fight insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe have the Accra initiative, the G5 initiative, the Sahel initiative. The security situation as well as the food production crises create an unprecedent humanitarian rises in the region.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the number of Internally Displaced Persons in the region went from 4.4 million to 5.5 million, so there is a large increase in the numbers of IDPs.\n\n\u201cSo this shows the extent of the crises facing our region because of the double burden of security and food production.\n\n\u201cWe continue to deploy our early warnings centers.

It revealed that an IMF team led by the Country Director, Ms. Jesmin Rahman, held meetings with Nigerian authorities from June 6th to 10th, 2022, to discuss recent economic and financial developments, and the economic outlook for the country.\n\nThe fund in the statement noted that Nigeria\u2019s economic recovery continued to gain strength on the back of services and agriculture with GDP growth reaching 3.6 percent (y/y) in first quarter 2022.\n\nIt stated that inflation reached 17.7 percent (y/y) in May led by a renewed surge in food prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, and raising food security concerns as over 40 per cent of the population live below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cTo contain inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Nigeria has recently hiked its monetary policy rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent.\n\n\u201cRegarding the external sector, the current account deficit narrowed significantly in 2021 helped by import compression and higher net oil balance. However, the improving trade balance, which has continued so far in 2022, is having a limited impact on forex strains with the exchange rate premiums in the parallel market staying in the 35-40 percent range since October 2021,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the IMF, despite supportive oil prices, the country\u2019s gross FX reserves fell to $38.6 billion at end-May 2022, having reached $41.5 billion in September 2021 boosted by SDR allocation and Eurobond issuance.\n\n\u201cRegarding the economic outlook, GDP growth is projected at 3.4 percent (y/y) in 2022 while inflation is expected to remain elevated . The fiscal deficit of the Consolidated Government is expected to remain high at 6.1 percent of GDP due in great measure to costly petrol subsidies and limited tax revenue collections.\n\n\u201cDownside risks to the near-term arise from further deterioration of security conditions, elections, low vaccination against Covid-19 and higher global interest rates. On the upside, steady private sector recovery and further broadening of growth, the start of operations at the Dangote refinery and decisive steps to mobilize revenues, in line with the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative (SRGI) could spur inclusive growth and development.\n\n\u201cThe IMF mission would like to thank the authorities and other counterparts for the open and thoughtful discussions and excellent cooperation,\u201d it added.",

          "text": "The President of the African Export and Import Bank (Afreximbank), Prof. Okey Oramah has identified African youths as the catalytic force that would propel the realisation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative.\n\nOramah said this Wednesday in his opening address to the Afreximbank 2022 Annual Meetings in Cairo, Egypt, where he declared that Afreximbank Central Bank Deposit Programme (ACBDP) had mobilised $35 billion and attracted 50 participants since its inception in 2019.\n\nThe theme of the annual meetings is \u201cRealising the AfCFTA Potential in the Post COVID-19 Era: Leveraging the Power of the Youths.\u201d\n\nHe also used the address to counter the conclusions of The Economist Magazine in an article titled \u201cAfrica\u2019s Ambitious Trade Plan: Need to Speed Up,\u201d which stated that continued political wrangling among Africa\u2019s leaders might squander the promise of freer trade.\n\nOramah said: \u201cA youth powered AfCFTA will trigger a continental economic expansion; and whether the next decade will become lost decade for Africa will depend on how we creatively deploy the energies and tenacity of our youth to implement the AfCFTA agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the protocol on the youth will be negotiated under the AfCFTA. That will provide a great opportunity to formalise the integration of the youth into the continent wide agenda.\n\n\u201cAs the youths are technologically savvy, and we believe that it is technology that will bring down the borders, Afreximbank and the AfCFTA secretariat have started to implement a digital AfCFTA called the Africa Trrade Gateway. This will offer the opportunity for the youths to access African market, access payment services and access credit.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the youths will be catalytic force to the realisation of the AfCFTA agenda.\u201d\n\nHe singled out the President of the Dangote Group, Mr. Aliko Dangote, and the Founder of Africanpreneur, Mr. Tony Elumelu, among Africans that pioneered businesses of global consequences in their youthful days.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe African youths are beginning to make significant contributions to economic transformation across the continent. For example, Mr. Aliko Dangote, as a young man in his early twenties began to build what today has become a global multibillion dollar conglomerate that has pivoted him to be the wealthiest person in Africa today.\n\n\u201cIt was a young Tony Elumelu who transformed an ailing commercial bank into an African multinational financial institution.\n\n\u201cMany African youths who are talented are making the waves around the world. The African youths are poised to make a giant leap in a single continental market and could seamlessly become the drivers of African integration and intra-African trade.\u201d\n\nOramah pointed out that, \u201cpolicies that give them intellectual property protection, ease cost of doing business, as well as improved access to market will unleash the power of the youth on the continent.\n\n\u201cThat is why Afreximbank is today intervening with instruments that are geared toward supporting the growth of small businesses and promoting their integration into national, regional and continental value chain.\n\n\u201cAfreximbank has therefore launched the \u2018How-to-Export within the AfCFTA.\u2019 Through this initiative, Afreximbank is partnering with the International Trade Centre to train small businesses and young entrepreneurs in Africa to participate in the AfCFTA.\n\nMoreover, the president of Afreximbank added that the bank was also prioritising the continent\u2019s \u201cculture and creative industries as they hold a potent force to accelerate integration under pre dominantly youth based.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Afreximbank, we are promoting industry through dedicated $500 million funding that is currently being implemented.\n\n\u201cAs we deliberate on these topical issues during the next three days, we are going to produce policy recommendations that will help us step up the implementation of the trade agreement,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on the ACBDP, Oramah said the Central Bank of Egypt and the Central Bank of Nigeria were the, \u201cinitial depositors under the scheme with billions of dallar. The effect is that the scheme that started tentatively now has 50 participants and through it we have been able to mobilise $35 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Economist of London had in March published an article titled \u201cAfrica\u2019s Ambitious Trade Plan: Need to Speed Up,\u201d that stated that, \u201csadly there has been all too little progress since,\u201d1963, when Africa, politicians called for a common continental market.\n\nThe report had added, \u201calthough the AfCFTA has in theory been operational since the beginning of this year, in practice no trade has happened under its terms because of continued political wrangling; Africa\u2019s leaders risk squandering the promise of freer trade.\u201d\n\nBut Oramah argued that while the magazine was right in the facts set out in their article, its conclusions were wrong, adding that the facts were symptoms of problems the article did not explore.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut while the problems were identified decades ago, it is only now that Africa can boost of possessing a combination of factors that can resolve it. These include a visionary leadership, the youth and digital technology.\n\n\u201cOur leadership has done the courageous work of giving us the AfCFTA. A lot now hinges on our youths.\u201d",
