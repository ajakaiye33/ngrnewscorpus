          "text": "Barrister Aloy Ejimakor, a Special Counsel to the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has given an insight into the recent court hearing of the IPOB leader on Wednesday.\n\nEjimakor said that the court stated, \u201cThat Mazi Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in the detention facility. That he be allowed a change of clothing.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by the lawyer, he noted that during the hearing, there was a total absence of security operatives in court and around the outer perimeters as was the case during previous proceedings.\n\nAlso, Ejimakor stated that Mazi Kanu was not in court and there was no officer from the Department of State Service to explain why. However, from what he surmised, both the court and the DSS might have concluded that his presence in court was not strictly required in the sort of application that was moved in court today.\n\nThe lawyer also claimed that the court did not grant Kanu\u2019s legal team the leave to move their application challenging the jurisdiction of the court to continue the trial.\n\nThe statement further read, \u201cRecall that we had filed such application, arguing that the extraordinary rendition of Kanu constitutes a constitutional barrier to his trial. The court ruled that the application was not calendared for hearing today. That it will be heard at the next adjourned date.\n\n\u201cThe court, after going through what it said is a tight judicial calendar, moved the date of the next hearing backwards from 19th to 18th January 2022. The court ruled that it will entertain all outstanding applications at the next hearing date, and proceeded to make the following Orders: That Mazi Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in the detention facility. That he be allowed a change of clothing.\u201d\n\nMore so, the lawyer noted that the court gave the IPOB leader the nod to practice his Jewish faith.\n\nEjimakor further noted, \u201cThat he be allowed free practice of his Jewish faith including access to his Jewish religious materials. That the DSS obey all previous orders granted in the matter, including allowing Kanu any visitor of his choice. That Kanu be permitted, at his option, to mingle freely with other inmates or any other persons at the detention facility.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

However, if time permits, we will re-apply for his transfer to prison custody,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIt will be recalled that FG had on October 21, re-arrainged Kanu on a seven-count amended charge.\n\nFG, in the amended charge marked FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015, alleged that Kanu had in furtherance of an act of terrorism, issued a deadly threat that anyone that flouted his sit-at-home order should write his or her will.\n\nIt alleged that as a result of Kanu\u2019s directive, banks, schools, markets, shopping malls, fuel stations were not opened for businesses, with vehicular movements grounded in the South East region of the country.\n\nIt said the action amounted to an offence contrary to and punishable under 1(2) (b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nFG alleged that Kanu had \u201con or about the 28th April, 2015 in London, United Kingdom did in a broadcast on Radio Biafra monitored in Enugu, Enugu state and other parts of Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, referred to Major General Muhammadu Buhari, GCON, President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a paedophile, a terrorist, an idiot and an embodiment of evil, knowing same to be false and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 375 of the Criminal Code Act, Cap C. 38 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004\u201d.\n\nHe was alleged to have committed treasonable felony, an offence punishable under Section 41(C) of the Criminal Code Act, CAP C38 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria\n\nHe was alleged to had between 2018 and 2021, through Radio Biafra, professed to be a member of IPOB, a proscribed organization in Nigeria, and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 16 of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nIn count five of the charge, FG alleged that Kanu had on April 22, 2021, in London, the United Kingdom, on Radio Biafra monitored in Enugu and other parts of Nigeria, did an act of terrorism \u201cin that you incite the other members (followers) of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a proscribed organization in Nigeria, to look for security personnel, their family members through a Radio Biafra on 102.1FM monitored through the IPOB Community Radio, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 1 (2) (h) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nAttached in support of the amended charge dated October 14, included a seven-paragraphed affidavit of completion of investigation deposed to by one Loveme Odubo, a prosecutor in the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nFG equally lined up five witnesses to testify in the matter, among whom are officials of the DSS and one Ronald S. who was identified as the manager of a Hotel in Lagos.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Outlines strategy in power sector revamp\n\nBy Ediri Ejoh\n\nThe Federal Government has hinted that its subsidy on electricity tariff is about N1.0 trillion between 2019 and 2021.\n\nThe amount represents the gap between the Cost Reflective Tariff (CRT) and Allowable Tariff (AT) which peaked at N28 per unit of electricity supplied to consumers.\n\nThis, according to the government, was largely responsible for liquidity crunch in the power sector as well as the poor power supply in the country.\n\nREAD ALSOFidelity Bank boss canvasses enabling environment for FDIs\n\nConsequently, it has disclosed its plans to re-align its policies, regulations and the activities of the power sector operators as a means of improving electricity supply.\n\nDisclosing these at the 12th edition of PwC Nigeria\u2019s Annual Power and Utilities Roundtable, yesterday, Ahmad Zakari, Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Infrastructure, also said that the nation needs to optimise the potentials in the power sector through a cost-reflective tariff regime.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe need a holistic review, the first thing is regulatory and policy alignment. Through this measure by the government, we can eliminate the gap in service based tariff.\n\n\u201cAt this time, DISCOs with the revised economic models, will be faced with incentives and penalties that would allow them to be able to achieve optimisation. The second phase will now be infrastructure alignment. If the economics of tariff-base works, then infrastructure will be improved.\n\n\u201cWith cost-reflective tariff everything will fall in place in the power sector. From the Government\u2019s perspective as we migrated towards this, we have understanding that more needs to be done. For instance, our cost reflective tariff (CRT) versus allowable tariff (AT) gap reached a peak of N28 gap in 2019, at that rate, between that period and 2021 alone, we would have recorded N1 trillion in tariff shortfall or subsidy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that, \u201cAs at 2015, at the take-off of the power sector privatization, the gap between CRT and AT was about N15. That figure has reduced to N6.\n\n\u201cThe gap has closed from N28, N15 and now N6.

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Aidoghie Paulinus, Fred Ezeh and Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja\n\nAnxiety has gripped Nigerians following the reported detection of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, in the country.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) revealed, yesterday, that the variant was detected in the cause of its genomic surveillance for inbound international travelers arriving in the country at its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja and network of other testing laboratories.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIts Director General, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, in a statement, explained that samples obtained for the stipulated day two test for travelers to Nigeria were positive for the variant in three persons with history of travel to South Africa.\n\nHowever, he said from a technical perspective, a travel ban would not be recommended because it is not not driven by science.\n\n\u201cWe are currently the subject of travel ban ourselves for reason that are not driven by science and as we know, recent information from the Netherlands showed cases of these variants before the South Africans did. A travel ban is not the way to go at the moment, what we need is enhanced surveillance, vigilance and for our population to adhere to recommended safety measures. At the last count, over 22 countries have reported this variant, so where would the banning end if you start?\n\n\u201cTwenty four hours before, we said with great confidence that there were no Omicron variant in the country, which was correct because we depended on the state of results at the time. Surveillance is an ongoing activity and we continue to generate results from the laboratory on a daily basis. The update was correct at the time the press release was issued and we would not be surprised if we find more cases as we continue to sequence all of the samples that continue to accrue. This is reflective of the situation worldwide because the number of countries that are importing this variants continue to increase.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the measures that we have in place, we will continue to enhance surveillance as is recommended at this time and we had to conduct a risk based assessment of transmission. We have to look at travelers and ensure they abide by the travel advisory. We have made the day two tests compulsory for everyone regardless of the status of vaccination. We are not focusing on Southern African countries, we are giving attention to all travelers coming into the country. Most cases with this variant are mild and we have not recorded any fatalities.\u201d\n\nThis came as Cyril Ramaphosa, president of South Africa called for the reversal of travel restrictions placed on African countries over fears of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nHe said the discriminatory restrictions would have long-lasting effects on the economies of the affected countries.\n\nThe United Kingdom, European Union and the United States are among those that have imposed a travel ban on South Africa and its neighboring countries due to fears of Omicron. The Canadian government has also banned travellers from Nigeria and nine other African countries.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government made good its threat, yesterday, as civil servants and the general public without proof of vaccination and negative PCR tests were denied access in government buildings in Abuja.\n\nIn October, the Federal Government had mandated civil servants to get vaccinated.\n\nBoss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), had said workers who failed to get vaccinated would be barred from entering their places of work from December 1.\n\nSome civil servants who spoke with Daily Sun expressed worries over the compulsory vaccination since it does not stop one from contracting the the virus while others pleaded for more time to enable them do the needful.\n\nFlorence Adam, who works with one of the government offices around Area 11, confirmed she and others who had not taken the vaccine were not allowed into office.\n\n\u201cI never knew they were serious about it. I know we have failed on our own part because we deliberately refused to take the vaccine because they were all over. I even met some of them at my junction, yesterday, but refused to be vaccinated. I just want to plead with the Federal Government to give us more grace by extending the date and also increase the sensitisation because most people are being misinformed, especially by religious leaders.\u201d\n\nAnother civil servant, Alice Age, said COVID-19 vaccination was not supposed to be made compulsory.\n\n\u201cThough,I have taken it, I\u2019m still not convinced that there is anything thing like COVID-19. There is enough tension in the land. They should stop putting more on the poor masses.\u201d\n\nFriday Adanu pleaded with the government to extend the deadline.\n\n\u201cI came all the way from my state to submit a document in the federal secretariat but was denied access I have not taken my vaccine. It is very painful because the transport was even borrowed. I know it is not the government\u2019s fault but I\u2019m pleading with them to extend the deadline so that I can complete my mission in Abuja and go back and do the needful.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, raised the alarm that lack of vaccination by developing countries would provide a fertile ground for COVID-19 to mutate and threaten the progress already recorded even in developed countries.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, issued the warning in Madrid, Spain, on Wednesday at the 24th General Assembly of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nRaging issues threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity, yesterday, dominated discussions as the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, and former Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, Attahiru Jega, decried the poor attention being paid to it by politicians.\n\nThe duo spoke at different fora in Abuja.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAt a summit on national unity organised in Abuja by National Prosperity Movement, Fayemi said: \u201cTo be sure, unity cannot endure where injustice, exclusion, inequity and marginalisation are embedded in the practice of governance. I have often shuddered at the spectacle whereby some among us who have been entrusted with leadership responsibility very easily slide into the role of ethno-regional champions, xenophobes, and zealots.\u201d\n\nThe Ekiti governor submitted that fostering unity in a context of multiple diversities requires fulsome attention to equity, justice, fair play, and merit.\n\nFayemi advised that \u201cwhile it is normal that leaders must have their ears to the ground and feel the pulse of the people who have elected them \u2013 imbibing, reproducing and spilling out raw and crude bile and pushing scorched earth solutions crosses the line of representation to become an exercise in the shirking of responsibility.\n\n\u201cUnlike the bulk of their followers, leaders are positioned and privileged to know that in matters of nation- and state-building, the world is far more complex than the simple and many a-times simplistic binary divisions that are frequently deployed to oppose black and white.\n\n\u201cLeaders must truly lead by using the broader, more complex, and better nuanced understanding they have to help moderate and modulate seasons of deep division in the polity, rather than becoming the ones who add fuel to a raging fire.\u201d\n\nDelivering the Keynote address, Jega berated all civilian administrations since 1999 for not doing enough to promote national unity.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the attention paid to the question of national unity and integration by successive military regimes has not been matched by successive civilian administrations. Except for sloganeering in the third republic, when former civilian president, Shehu Shagari as National Party of Nigeria\u2019s presidential candidate, and subsequently as president, popularised the slogan of \u2018One Nation, One Destiny\u2019, subsequent civilian administrations, especially since 1999 seem to have, more or less, presided over the undermining if not destruction of the bases and foundations of national unity and integration in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nJega submitted that national unity would only best be promoted through tolerance and accommodation of each other\u2019s differences, opinions, ethnic, religious and communal or even regional identities.\n\nHe believed that \u201cat the core of national unity are non-discriminatory relations whether at the personal or official levels. The sad thing is that in contemporary Nigeria, all these are in dire short supply.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at another forum, Governor Fayemi, also passed a damning verdict on the nation, saying not only is it in most unhealthy state, but also in the doldrums.\n\n\u201cFirst, we have to agree that indeed, Nigeria is sleeping and also agree that it is a giant. And when you have a giant, you can approach that giant from all sides. It is like an elephant. And I believe that is only the perspective from which many of us will approach the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cBut the Nigerian state is not in its most healthy state. There is no debate about that regardless of political persuasion, regardless of ethnic consideration, regardless of economic opportunities available or unavailable to individuals, our country is in the doldrums,\u201d he said at ThisNigeria annual lecture and Gold Prize in Abuja.\n\nFayemi, however, said in every adversity, there is always an opportunity, adding that it was the ability of Nigerians to identify what those opportunities were that would take Nigerians further in the nation-building journey.\n\nThe NGF chairman also said nation-building anywhere in the world does not happen by happenstance, saying it is a long, tortuous and arduous process.\n\n\u201cAnd it is not a 60-year process. Many countries have been at it for centuries and they are still in search of a more perfect union as the American constitution will put it. And that search must continue. However, we must see sights of progress along the way; we must be able to identify those shoots, those little incomes that will become tall oaks sooner, rather than later because for those of us who still, at least, saw that good Nigeria relatively speaking, we have a sense of what that country should be. We have a sense of what is expected of the largest country with black people in the world. And we also have a sense of the expectation that the world has of us which we clearly have not lived up to.\u201d\n\nFayemi said he was sure there was something in the mind of the writer of the lines in the second stanza of the national anthem when he put them together.\n\nHe stated that Nigerians can talk about unity as much as they liked, talk about national integration as much as they wanted and can lionise patriotism, but cannot build a country on the basis of iniquity, injustice, lack of fairness and expect unity to prevail.\n\nFayemi noted that Nigerians see possibilities all the time even when they are at the verge of hopelessness. He stated that what recently took place in Anambra was a miracle because many Nigerians already had come to the conclusion that Anambra was going to be a bloodbath but it turned out the other way round.\n\nHe gave kudos to the National Peace Committee convened by Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, and chaired by former military head of state, Abdulsalami Abubakar, including the people of Anambra and INEC.\n\nDelivering a lecture entitled: \u2018National Cohesion for Growth and Progress: The Nigeria Dilemma\u2019, Kukah said the conversation was not about the All Progressives Congress (APC) or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but to achieve national cohesion.\n\nHe said to achieve national cohesion, Nigerians needed to have a reliable constitution which is encompassing.\n\n\u201cNigerians are angrier now more than before but we get nostalgic about the past, thinking Nigeria was better before now. But the truth is, we were less educated or exposed before now.\u201d\n\nWhile decrying the decline in the quality of leadership in the country, Kukah added that patriotism was not a product of exchange.\n\n\u201cWe have never suffered from psychological trauma than now. I have a moral duty to know what is right and wrong. It has never been this bad in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKukah also said going by happenings in the country, it was more important to be a Muslim than to be a northerner in terms of appointment.\n\n\u201cWe want peace. Even criminals want peace. But we are in despair in Nigeria. Something is wrong with Nigeria,\u201d Kukah also said.\n\nPublisher and Chief Executive Officer of ThisNigeria Newspaper, Eric Osagie, said the newspaper was set up to tell Nigerians the truth and at the end of the day, give Nigerians a platform to express their views.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

In this regard, we need improvement in educational and scientific cooperation, mines and energy resources, transport and aviation, tourism, youth exchange programmes, trade and investment and military cooperation, to mention but a few.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria leader told ministers and government delegates of both countries that their strong bond of brotherhood would be of great benefit to Africa as a catalyst for economic, technological, social and cultural development and as a force for peace and security on the continent.\n\n\u201cLet me at this point reiterate my commitment to ensure that the special relationship between our two countries is continually strengthened.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said it was fulfilling that despite all the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the BNC held on schedule.\n\n\u201cIt is also gratifying to observe that this has been brought about by the dogged commitment of senior officials from our countries. More importantly, it is gratifying to note that despite the pandemic, our timelines for implementing some decisions of the ninth BNC have been met.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, discussions are ongoing on new and important areas of cooperation between our two countries.

          "text": "\u2022Describes visit as success despite omicron variant scare\n\n\u2022Again, South African president flays travel ban on his country\n\n\u2022Says it\u2019s unscientific, unfair, discriminatory\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday stressed the need for Nigeria and South Africa to strengthen bilateral ties and avoid unnecessary rivalry. Buhari made the call in Abuja at the opening of the 10th session of the Nigeria-South Africa Bi-National Commission (BNC).\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa, again, flayed the recent travel ban on his country by some European countries, describing it as unfair, unscientific, and discriminatory.\n\nDuring the session at State House, Abuja, Buhari underlined Nigeria\u2019s commitment to a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with South Africa. He said such relationship would bring gains to the continent, particularly in education, science, trade and investment, tourism, and security.\n\nDeclaring open the 10th session of the BNC in his office, Buhari said, \u201cPermit me to state that some of the challenges identified during the last BNC have not been completely addressed. We need to ensure that our people-to-people relations are enhanced to a point where there would be no need for unhealthy competition.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, we need improvement in educational and scientific cooperation, mines and energy resources, transport and aviation, tourism, youth exchange programmes, trade and investment, and military cooperation, to mention but a few.\u201d\n\nThe president told ministers and top government officials of both countries that a strong bond of brotherhood between Nigeria and South Africa would be of great benefit to Africa. It would serve as a catalyst for economic, technological, social and cultural development and as a force for peace and security on the continent, he stated.\n\n\u201cLet me at this point reiterate my commitment to ensure that the special relationship between our two countries is continually strengthened,\u201d he added.\n\nBuhari said it was fulfilling that despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the BNC still held as scheduled.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is also gratifying to observe that this has been brought about by the dogged commitment of senior officials from our countries.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, it is gratifying to note that despite the pandemic, our timelines for implementing some decisions of the 9th BNC have been met. Similarly, discussions are on-going on new and important areas of cooperation between our two countries.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the summit, Buhari expressed delight at its successful conclusion, calling it \u201cheart-warming and a source of great pride that we have been able to further cement the special bond of fraternal friendship between our two countries.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that the agreement on Early Warning Mechanism would \u201cimprove the people-to-people relations of our two countries. Similarly, our two countries have established high level official communication channels for diplomatic consultations, trade and investment, and will, shortly, inaugurate the Nigeria \u2013 South Africa Youth Dialogue. I am confident that these vehicles of engagement and cooperation will serve our mutual interests.\u201d\n\nBoth presidents, also yesterday, launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue for Peace and Security, Youth Development and Political Participation.\n\nSpeaking to the youth virtually, Buhari said he was optimistic that the initiative would promote peace building and development as well as help both countries to jointly combat youth restiveness.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that the dialogue would enable both countries to strategically develop \u201ca vast world of collaboration in areas of science and technology,\u201d including climate change, energy demands, green technology, artificial intelligence, cyber security, telematics, agriculture, technology and much more.\n\nHe stated, \u201dNigeria and South Africa have a combined population of about 262 million, of which 95 million are youth. This represents tremendous potential for both countries if we can truly harness this demographic with more dedicated action.\n\n\u201cThis sizable youth population may also represent significant problems if we fail to maximise their potential in a world that globalisation and technology are reshaping at breakneck speed.\n\n\u201dThese are the rationale for proposing this Youth Dialogue. Both countries need more educated youth, more skilled youth, more youth in entrepreneurship, more solution providers, and peacekeepers and more patriotic youth.\n\n\u201cIt is true that our youth already collaborate, especially in the creative arts, sharing our rich cultures. We will build upon this, especially in the framework of the intra- African trade expansion we intend to promote through the African Continental Free Trade Agreement.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader said strategic and committed collaborations in science and technology and many other areas would provide both countries with solutions and critical intellectual property to unleash economic outcomes for the creation of millions of jobs.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference after the bilateral talks, Buhari described Ramaphosa\u2019s visit as successful, despite the scare generated by the new Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nHe said, \u201cDespite the scare generated by the new COVID-19 variant, we have been able to hold successful meetings, while observing strict COVID-19 protocols, through fraternal cooperation and understanding.\n\n\u201cI sincerely wish to thank my brother and colleague, President Cyril Ramaphosa, for honouring my invitation. I equally wish to thank members of the South African delegation and the experts that worked tirelessly during the Senior Officials Meeting.\n\n\u201cToday, has witnessed the signing of new Memoranda of Understanding between Nigeria and South Africa in diverse areas, including Youth Development, Women and Child Empowerment and Political Consultations; critical areas that will lead to increased people to people contact.\n\n\u201cAlso, existing MOUs signed during previous Bi-National Commission meetings were also reviewed. These include MOUs on military cooperation, power, cooperation in the fields of geology, mining, and mineral processing, oil and gas and several others.\n\n\u201cToday, we also jointly launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue, another veritable tool for interaction among our youth with the aim of creating shared values and aspiration. Many of our youth from Nigeria and South Africa joined us virtually during the launch.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa described the travel ban imposed on his country and some of its neighbours by some Western countries as discriminatory, arbitrary, and unscientific.\n\nThe United States, United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), and Canada imposed travel bans on South Africa and some Southern African countries following the recent detection of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 by South African scientists.\n\nOmicron has been classed as a \u201cvariance of concern\u201d, as early evidence suggests that it has a higher re-infection risk.\n\nBut Ramaphosa said at the press conference that the decision to impose a ban on travels to and from his country and others would be counterproductive in the long run. He commended Nigeria and other African countries that had decided to express solidarity with South Africa and its neighbours by not shutting their doors against sister African nations over the new COVID-19 strain.\n\nRamaphosa said, \u201cI think it is important that I emphasise this in the light of the discovery by South African scientists of the Omicron variant of the Coronavirus and subsequent imposition of extremely harsh and unfair travel restrictions on flights from and to South Africa as well as on a number of other African countries.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari, the solidarity expressed by yourself and the government of Nigeria sends the strongest message. It says that as African countries, we are standing united against the imposition of arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions that are not only unscientific, but counterproductive in the long run.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the leaders of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, where we are traveling to later today, as well as the leaders of Ghana and Senegal, have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the travel ban against South Africa and our sister countries in Southern Africa.\n\n\u201cThis is a global pandemic. And overcoming it requires that we collaborate and work together as a collective. The resulting damage to this travel ban to the economies of the countries affected will be considerable and long lasting.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to use this opportunity to once again call on the countries who have imposed this ban to reverse their decisions, whether they are in the northern, more developed economies or in other parts of our continent and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the agreements and memoranda signed between his country and Nigeria, Ramaphosa said, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a successful 10th session of the Nigeria-South Africa Bi-national Commission. President Buhari and I witnessed the signing of a number of agreements and memoranda of understanding to advance trade and investment, development, economic upliftment, as well as youth empowerment, among others.\n\n\u201cThese new agreements between our two countries broaden the scope of our cooperation on issues of common interest and mutual benefits and we will continue to work together to ensure their implementation. At present, our countries have signed approximately 32 agreements and today we have added other agreements.\n\n\u201cThey are an MOU in the field of youth development and agreement on audio visual cooperation, and a programme of cooperation on arts and culture. The youth development agreement will be key to improving people-to-people relations and capacitating the young people of our two countries in acceding to higher levels of development, as well as progress.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa, Nigeria both have rich cultural, vibrant arts and flourishing sports sectors, all of which will be greatly enriched through greater collaboration through the programme of cooperation between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe agreement on audio visual cooperation will be a boost to the film production industries in our respective countries and we, as South Africa, stands to benefit greatly from cooperation with the world-famous Nollywood that has really emerged very strongly here in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Segun James, Emma Okonji\n\nand Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nAttorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), yesterday, justified the government\u2019s White Paper on the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) report on the October 2020 Lekki tollgate incident, saying the government complied with the laws and the weight of evidence presented at the panel to reach a decision.\n\nAccording to him, the position of the Government as stated in the White Paper was not contrary to the panel\u2019s findings, especially, the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, who said only three of the bodies that he conducted post mortem examination on during the EndSARS protests, were from Lekki, and out of whom only one had gunshot injury.\n\nOnigbanjo, who spoke during a Morning Show programme on the ARISE News Television, said inconsistencies and contradictions in the leaked reports of the panel that nine people died at the Lekki tollgate made the panel\u2019s finding in respect to deaths at the tollgate unreliable, adding that for a finding that somebody died at a scene to be acceptable, there must be no doubt.\n\n\u201cThe position of Lagos State Government is based on the findings of the panel itself. So, it is not that Lagos State Government just conjured things from the air. We went through the report and what we saw particularly in reference to the death of nine persons is that they found the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. Obafunwa, who conducted an autopsy on all the bodies picked up all over Lagos during the protests, not just at Lekki Tollgate but statewide, credible and there was no evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cProf. Obafunwa said of all the bodies he conducted autopsies on, three came from Lekki and out of the three only one had gunshot injuries. And the panel then said we believe you;we accept your evidence, because there is nothing to the contrary. So, in law, if you put that on the imaginary scale, it means what Prof. Obafunwa said outweighs every other evidence before the panel,\u201d he said.\n\nOnigbanjo further debunked the allegations that the panel made no reference to policemen nor took them into consideration.\n\n\u201cThey (JPI) issued two reports. The report that leaked only dealt with the issues from the Lekki Toll Gate. There is another report, which they issued which was not leaked; that report deals with all the EndSARS petitions that were about 253 in number and of the 253, policemen also brought their own petitions and in that report, the panel awarded a sum of about N36.2million to the policemen, who were affected one way or the other by the protests.\n\n\u201cSo, to be fair to them, they did consider the plights of the policemen too. And even if you look at most of their recommendations, they are for better welfare for the police, better equipment, more training, psychological evaluations. So, they took them into consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attorney-general, however, denied the allegations that Lagos State Government was put under pressure by the federal government to discredit the panel\u2019s report, adding that at no time did the state government encourage personal attacks against any members of the panel.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe federal government never put the Lagos State Government under any pressure to discredit the panel or anybody. If you check the records, nobody from Lagos State Government discredited the panel. In fact, they submitted the report on the 15th of November 2021, the governor praised them and thanked them for the job they did.\n\n\u201cEven yesterday, in his speech, which he made before the White Paper was released, he thanked them again. So, nobody from the Lagos State Government directly or indirectly has sought to discredit members of the panel. We appreciate the job they did for almost 13 months. We do not condone such attacks on anybody.\n\n\u201cI think we have conducted ourselves in such a manner that we strive to always do what is right. We complied with the law; we set up the panel. So, if we didn\u2019t even want the panel, there are so many ways it could have been stopped. They asked for an extension, we gave them. The initial funding was N200million; they exhausted it and asked for more, we gave them.\n\n\u201cWe appointed independent-minded people into the panel. And the panel itself said in its report that they give credit to the Lagos State Government for allowing them to be completely independent. Lagos State Government has fulfilled all its promises to the public. We set up an independent panel, we said we will release a White Paper and we did. We have complied with the law all the way.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Onigbanjo: Lagos Will Make Full #EndSARS Panel Report Public",
          "text": "Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) is the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State. In this interview with Arise Television, the senior lawyer bares his mind on the controversies surrounding the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI). Onigbanjo insists that the report of the panel remains inconsistent, saying that to clear all doubts, the government will soon make the full document available to the public. Emmanuel Addeh presents the excerpts:\n\nThe white paper panel on the investigations into police brutality and the killings at the Lekki Tollgate has revealed that it was full of inconsistencies and contradictions and to that extent, that some of the recommendations are unacceptable.\n\nThe key one was the white paper saying that there was no massacre in context, as submitted by that particular panel and that it is not true that nine persons died. Do you want to take us through some of those inconsistencies and contradictions before we begin to look at the recommendations?\n\nThe position of Lagos state government is based entirely on the report submitted by the panel itself.\n\nWe went through the report, and we saw that the judicial panel said that they found the evidence of Prof. John Obafunwa, the pathologist who conducted autopsies on all the bodies picked up all over Lagos during the protests, not just that at Lekki Tollgate, but state-wide, that they found his evidence credible, and that there was no evidence to the contrary.\n\nProf. Obafunwa said that of all the bodies he conducted autopsies on, three came from Lekki. That out of the three, only one had a gunshot injury.\n\nAnd the panel said, we believe you, we accept your evidence, because there is nothing to the contrary. So, in law, if you put that on the imaginary scale, it means what Obafunwa said, outweighs every other evidence before the panel.\n\nThey said there was nothing to the contrary, then the panel then goes on to say there were nine deaths. If you look at that page, where they listed out 11 deceased persons from Lekki Tollgate, there was no explanation as to how they arrived at that conclusion, how they came about the names, who shot them, when they were shot. So that\u2019s a contradiction.\n\nTake for example, again, they said nine people died, and they awarded compensation to only one, why? if you believe nine people died, why are you not awarding compensation to the other eight people?\n\nThey also awarded one Nathaniel Solomon. That he was deceased at Lekki Tollgate. It also turns out that Nathaniel Solomon was a witness before them, who had the petition in respect of his late brother.\n\nAn allegation that somebody was murdered is not one to be made lightly. In fact, in criminal law jurisprudence, you must prove it beyond reasonable doubt. But where you have these inconsistencies, is Nathaniel Solomon dead or alive, did one person die at Lekki or did nine people die? Those contradictions and many more made that particular finding unreliable.\n\nFor a finding that somebody died at a scene to be acceptable, there must be no doubt. What the panel did created doubts, it created gaps in their story of nine deaths. Once there are doubts, the doubts are usually resolved in favour of the person you\u2019re accusing to have murdered or killed those people.\n\nWe have listed out in the white paper, some of the contradictions, and we are also going to release the two reports of the panel for the public to judge by themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s not just going to be a case of Lagos state government, analysing this itself and coming to conclusions, we are going to make them available to everybody read it, and see how you can resolve the conflict.\n\nThey said, Oh, I agree with the pathologist, that one person died and was picked up on the 21st of October 2020, and then go on to then say somewhere else that nine persons died, and they did not even offer any explanation as to how these people died. How did these nine people die? who killed them? Who shot them? When were they killed? nothing.\n\nBecause this is the crux of the matter, I need to ask you, you\u2019ve made it very clear. But I must ask specifically for the avoidance of any doubt. It is the position of the Lagos state government that there was no massacre at the Lekki Tollgate. That is the position of the Lagos state government. Right?\n\nThe position of the Lagos state government is based on the findings of the panel itself. It is not that Lagos government just conjured this from the air. We looked at the report. That is what the panel itself said, that one person died at Lekki Tollgate, then it then went on to say nine people died.\n\nIt is not Lagos state government that is saying it. It is what the panel said, after reviewing the evidence of Prof. Obafunwa.\n\nThe evidence of the pathologist Prof. Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies that they conducted post mortem examination on were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury, and this was not debunked. We deem it credible, as the contrary was not presented before the panel. That\u2019s their own conclusion.\n\nBut I would like to ask you. Is it that nothing happened in Lekki? Can we also talk about the case of the police? The panel used the arms register and police officers in that particular police division, that they will normally collect 15 to 20 rounds of bullets. But on the night of the 20th, some collected 60 rounds of bullets and some even collected 75 rounds of bullets as stated in the report. So, what happened that night?\n\nIt is not that we\u2019re living in denial, not at all. The report itself, which I urge you all to find time to read, is about 550 pages and it says: 1. The military, the army was at Lekki Tollgate.\n\n2. fired gunshots.\n\nBut the forensic expert called by the panel itself said it couldn\u2019t determine that live rounds were fired. Although General Taiwo said the army went there with blanks with live bullets.\n\nRegarding the question about police taking more rounds on the night of the 20th, if you read the same report, the movement register of the police showed that one policeman was assigned to Lekki. It\u2019s all there.\n\nAnd so even if they took more rounds, you still have to go on to show that these rounds were actually used to kill a, b, c, d. It is not just to say, oh, they took more rounds, because then there is a gap. You have to tell us what they did with the rounds.\n\nWhat happened that night? Because the panel of inquiry was set up to know what happened on that night of the 20th at the Lekki Tollgate. But at the end of this panel of inquiry, it is obvious by the arguments and counter arguments that we have not been able to see the light of what happened on that night. What really happened, is it that nobody died? Is it that nothing happened?\n\nThat was the panel\u2019s duty. The state government set up the panel to find out precisely that. What they found out is contained in the report they have issued. We are going by that report, and I\u2019ve told you what they said.\n\nThat the army was there, no dispute; they fired shots in the air, whether blanks or live, I believe the panel said they fired blanks and live bullets.\n\nBut if you want to accuse somebody that he shot or killed somebody, you then have to go on to show the details. So, you can\u2019t leave anything to speculation like what you are saying is speculation. That so, because they took 70 rounds, because they took 50 per cent more rounds, if you cannot show how nine people died, you must be able to tell the world what happened at Lekki on that day.\n\nSo, if your findings, unfortunately leaves all these gaps, all these doubts, then we cannot rely on it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s secret police, Department of State Services (DSS), spends a minimum of N500 million each day it brings the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to court, top sources have told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe huge amount, it was gathered, goes into providing logistics including adequate security around the movement of the IPOB leader from DSS\u2019 facility to the court and back to the place.\n\nThe rearrest and rendition of Kanu, a high-profile detainee, to Nigeria from Kenya in June 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari's administration has continued to generate concerns globally.\n\nTherefore, should any harm come to Kanu while in detention, it is understood that the DSS is aware that it could lead to an unimaginable crisis.\n\n\u201cThe amount spent to bring Kanu to court for each appearance is huge.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site. Then there\u2019s one other digital sub-broker, Chaka, which is partnering with Renaissance Capital.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to know about spectrum auctions as Nigeria plans 5G",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) is preparing for the auction of a 3.5GHz spectrum on December 13. It is a primary step to the rollout of the 5G network on a commercial level in 2022.\n\nThe commission said interested parties in the auction include MTN and Airtel Africa. However sources there is a third party that is interested. In recent times, Huawei has weighed in on the reserve price of the spectrum which the NCC fixed at $197.4 million (N75 billion), which may indicate their interest in the spectrum.\n\nA condition to participating in the auction is that each interested operator was supposed to pick up the interest form, fill it and submit it on or before 5pm, 29 November 2021. The form will be accompanied by a non-refundable 10 percent initial deposit of the reserve price.\n\nThe NCC has in recent times fast-tracked its efforts towards ensuring a 5G rollout in Nigeria, beginning with securing the approval of the Federal Executive Council in October for a National Policy on 5G Networks to drive the digital economy.\n\nIn November, the commission said it was 97 percent ready for 5G deployment and would auction the 3.5GHz spectrum. Before the main auction, there will be a mock auction to take place on 10 December.\n\nWhat is a spectrum auction?\n\nSpectrum is the airwave that sends signals to devices such as cellphones and wireline telephones enabling them to connect with each other. The airwaves must be sent as designated frequencies to avoid any kind of interference.\n\nThese airwaves are sold for a certain period of time, after which their validity lapses, which is generally set at 10 years in Nigeria. At the end of the validity period, the licensees are expected to renew the licence as the NCC reserves the right to resell dormant licences after a period of time.\n\nThe federal government owns the airwaves. With the expansion in the number of cellphones, wireline telephones, and internet users, the need to provide more space for the signals arises from time to time.\n\nThe spectrum or airwave is subdivided into bands that have varying frequencies. AM and FM channels are all spread around 100MHz to 200MHz. The telecom spectrum starts from 800MHz and goes up to 2300MHz. The most suitable spectrum for telecommunication is in the 400MHz to 4GHz range. These bands are used globally for various telecom purposes. As a result, different standards such as GSM, WCDMA, and LTE were developed over time to use these bands, creating an ecosystem of technology that operators can deploy. Each country regulates the use of spectrum in its own territory but the same technology finds use around the world, which is how there are roaming services.\n\nRead also: Techmarket launches digital innovation for better customer communication\n\nA trail of spectrum auctions in Nigeria\n\nNigeria has had several spectrum auctions. Following the enactment of the Nigerian Communications Commission Decree No. 75 OF 1992, the NCC became responsible for radio spectrum licencing in the country.\n\nThe commission has a list of seven auctions it has conducted in the past. These include the 2 x 70 MHz slot in the 2.6GHz spectrum band in slots of 5MHz; 30 MHz of unpaired spectrum in the 2.3 GHz band; 40 MHz of paired spectrum in the 2 GHz band; 3 Carriers in the 800MHz spectrum band in 26 States, and FCT; four spectrum packages in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands; Fixed Wireless Access licences on a regional basis for the 37 Licensing Regions; second national operator licence.\n\nThe last auction the NCC has conducted was the auction of the 2.6GHz which was suspended twice, in February 2015 and March 2015. The NC later resumed the process on May 16 to 19 and expected bidders to have made payment by June 10, 2016. Only MTN indicated an interest in applying for six lots out of the available 14 slots in the 2.6GHz spectrum licence. The NCC reviewed MTN\u2019s application and in June 2016 announced the telco as the winner of the 2.6GHz spectrum licence.\n\nThe 2.3GHz spectrum was auctioned in February 2014. The reserved price was $23 million but Bitflux Consortium made up of VDT Communications and Superflux Group bid $23,251,000 to outbid Globacom whose bid was $23,050,001. Bidding opened at exactly 11.30 am and by 12.05 pm, a winner had emerged. It lasted only two rounds of 15 minutes each round against popular expectation that the auction may stretch all through the day into the next day.\n\nThe 40 MHz of paired spectrum in the 2 GHz band in 2007 was the first time Nigeria was auctioning spectrum for 3G. The auction had four telcos including MTN Nigeria, Globacom Celtel, and Alheri Engineering Limited bidding for 10MHz lots in the 2GHz band each. The NCC announced it was going to award the spectrum to the four companies as soon as the reserve price of $150 million within 14 business days of award of provisional licence.\n\nFor the 3 Carriers (3.75MHz) 800MHz spectrum band licence in 26 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Visafone Communications Limited emerged as the reserved bidder ahead of Multilinks and two other telecoms companies. According to the NCC only four licenced companies, namely GiCell Wireless, TC Africa Telecoms Network, Multilinks, and Visafone Communications, met the pre-qualification criteria, including payment of N40 million intention-to-bid deposit, at the close of business on July 9, 2007.\n\nThe Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) was issued to 11 companies to offer wireless internet and data service across the country on 1 July 2007. The companies that received the licence include XS Broadband Limited, Witel Limited, Rainbownet Limited, Odua Telecoms Limited, Cyberspace Limited, ipNX Nigeria Limited, and Wideaways Nigeria Limited.\n\nOthers include Hyperia Limited, Mega-Tech Engineering Nigeria Limited, Sirius Wireless Limited, Horizon Broadcasting and Telecommunications Limited, and Swift Networks.\n\nAuctions and criticisms\n\nAlthough the NCC has always tried to employ best global practices in conducting auctions, it has not always been devoid of controversies. The auction in Nigeria for a second national operator licence aimed at breaking the monopoly of NITEL led to some controversies. The process that led to the emergence of the winners was declared fraudulent by the then President Olusegun Obasanjo administration in 1999.\n\nThere was also a controversy with the 2.3GHz frequency auction in February 2014. In early 2013, operators such as Mobitel, Spectranet, and Direct on PC \u2013 all of which already operate on the 2.3GHz band \u2013 said they were opposed to the issuance of the new licence on the grounds that additional traffic at 2.3GHz would cause interference in the band, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on their business. The auction of the 2.3GHz band went forward despite the criticism of the deal.\n\nThe upcoming auction of 3.5GHz has also been criticised for the reserve price of N75 billion. MTN had told the NCC that the reserve price was 136 percent above the market price of 100 MHz of 3.5GHz spectrum. The high price may be the reason local telecom operators like 9Mobile and Globacom have yet to submit a bid for the 5G spectrum licence. Globacom told BusinessDay in October that it is monitoring the process and would respond in due time.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government and the citizens must agree on the removal of petrol subsidy that will cost Nigeria over N3 trillion by the end of 2021, World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri has said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s rising fiscal deficit is yet another sign of the country\u2019s ailing finances and makes a mockery of Abuja\u2019s insistence to continue with a wasteful petrol subsidy regime that gulps over a trillion naira per annum among other overly expensive ventures of a cash-strapped government.\n\nTo solve this, Chaudhuri said \u201cthere has to be a consensus within and among the political elites which he insists is the main reason Nigeria has not achieved its potential as Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\n\n\u201cThere has been no consensus agreement between the elites and everyone else on how best to solve this subsidy problem,\u201d Chaudhuri said during a visit to BusinessDay\u2019s corporate office in Lagos on Tuesday.\n\nHe called on the Nigerian government to consider the opportunity cost of its continued fuel subsidy and decide whether to end the policy completely or maintain the drain on its scarce resources.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s N3trn petrol subsidy widens deficit Eurobond can\u2019t fund\n\n\u201cPeople are aware of the social risk of civil unrest attached to the removal of subsidy,\u201d Chaudhuri said.\n\nHe added, \u201cother countries have gone through risks as well. They trade-off some choices. What we have said is, again on this, there is need for agreement and recognition\u201d.\n\nAccording to Chaudhuri, \u201chow this is communicated, stakeholders engagement, and finding a way of restoring trust deficit is important.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay calculations showed Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy projected to hit N3 trillion based on current market realities is 46 percent higher than the N1.6 trillion ($4 billion) the government raised through a Eurobond in September.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s fiscal position is deteriorating, resulting in higher debt and less space for investments in human capital and infrastructure,\u201d the World Bank said.\n\nData from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) showed that the Federal Government\u2019s fiscal deficit hit N2.4 trillion in the first quarter of 2021, up from N1.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and N1.4 trillion in the first quarter of 2020. That is after the government kept up with its expenditure plans, but fell way short of its revenue projection.\n\nAlso, World Bank\u2019s data showed cost of petrol subsidy is at a six-year high from N107 billion in 2020 to N864 billion between January and September 2021, significantly reducing fiscal space for social spending,\n\nIn 2022, the federal government plans to spend N3, 000 per person on health. In 2022, the petrol subsidy could cost N13, 000 per person, the World Bank said in its latest report.\n\nThe UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) says Nigeria\u2019s 13.2 million out-of-school children is the world\u2019s highest. But the cost of subsidising petrol is 10 times larger than the entire 2021 budget of N94.4 billion meant to pay for free Universal Basic Education.\n\nThe global bank raised concerns that the subsidy mostly benefits the rich and those who smuggle petrol to neighbouring countries.\n\nConsequently, it recommended that the N3 trillion recovered revenue should be redirected immediately to deliver N600 billion in cash support to the people over six months.\n\nThe World Bank also recommended that part of the money should be set aside for development priorities at all levels of government, including local government area development funds, state development funds, and national priority programmes.\n\nThe bank also advised the Nigerian government to allocate N850 billion to national priority programmes for security, interstate connectivity and power sector recovery.\n\nAccording to the bank, N800 billion needs to be set aside for state development funds, which should be spent on basic education, rural roads, and industrial zones, while N774 billion should be kept for local government development funds for primary healthcare, water and sanitation , and community development.\n\nChaudhuri said 20 million Nigerians comprising 10 million each from the national and local can benefit from N5,000 per month cash for the people in six months.\n\nNigeria is the only country in the world that subsidizes only petrol, the cost of which is massive and unsustainable; as a result, Nigeria is sacrificing critical investments in physical and human capital.\n\nThe report said 40 percent of the poorest consume less than 3 percent of the total PMS consumption in Nigeria, adding that by creating a large price differential between Nigeria and its neighbours, the PMS subsidy is incentivizing smuggling.",

We are determined to make Edo a healthcare hub in Nigeria. The healthcare system is really about the people. Infrastructure is important. If you don\u2019t have the people that are properly trained, then the equipment will just be fancy for tourism. Within the Edo axis, we can muster up to five thousand doctors in different specialisations.\n\n\u201cIf we have access to people who can provide quality healthcare and have world-class institutions or facilities to provide that training, then we should do it. Having the right governance means an arrangement where people don\u2019t need to travel to get the kind of care they need.\n\n\u201cWe are very keen and are anxious to get this started. For us as a state, we just try and execute. Hopefully, next week, we will establish a joint account and the procurement process has to be accelerated; within the next four to six weeks, let the orders be placed.\n\n\u201cI want to thank and appreciate you and the people of Edo will eternally be grateful. We can now proudly say that you have one of your largest investments in Africa in Edo and this is what they are contributing to the lives of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Abdul Samad Rabiu Africa Initiative, Dr. Ubon Udoh, commended the governor for impacting the lives of Edo people through healthcare, noting, \u201cIt is a clear indication of your vision for your state and commitment in bettering the lives of your people, through health care. We want to truly appreciate you for that show of commitment and of course, for that laudable project which you are proposing.\n\n\u201cWe are here to present to you a letter of award for a N2.5 billion grant for tertiary healthcare support system scheme to support the Stella Obasanjo Hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to start by putting an initial deposit of N1.25billion in a joint account between ASR Africa and Edo State Government; I want to congratulate you and your team.

          "text": "Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) says it has continued to be the preferred listing destination for companies seeking to raise capital via corporate bonds, equities and even private companies looking to raise public capital.\n\nAccording to it, market stakeholders were excited to learn last week that MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN) Plc is taking advantage of this opportunity and has obtained the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the offer for sale of up to 575 million ordinary shares in MTNN held by the MTN Group.\n\nCapital is critical for business growth, NGX plays a critical role in the capital formation process by mobilizing long-term savings to finance long-term investors and helping issuers and investors meet their objectives. In 2021, NGX has facilitated needed financing of over \u20a66.71Tn raised by governments and corporates across various asset classes. Notable among these transactions is Emzor Pharmaceuticals\u2019 N13.7 billion 5-Year Series 1 Fixed rate Senior Unsecured Bond listed exclusively on NGX in April 2021 and being the first public instrument issued by the company. Also notable is BUA Cement\u2019s debut listing of a N115 billion Bond issue, the largest of many corporate debt issuances in the history of the Nigerian capital market.\n\nAttention has now shifted to the equities market where MTNN will float the first Public Offer of 2021. The offer commenced by way of a book build to institutional investors (Institutional Offer), and subsequently, a fixed price to retail investors (Retail Offer). The Institutional Offer opened on 23 November 2021 to close on 26 November 26, after which a fixed price will be determined for the Retail Offer. Book building is a process that assists companies determine the price of their shares, with the help of investment bankers, when offering them in an Initial Public Offering (IPO).\n\nWhat is also interesting to note about this offer is that NGX has received \u2018No Objection\u2019 from the apex regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish and deploy an electronic platform for use in the e-offering of MTNN\u2019s public offer. The electronic platform, Primary Offer is sponsored by NGX and will provide retail investors with access to various capital market products and issuances from the convenience of their mobile devices. Primary Offer reinforces NGX\u2019s commitment to promoting financial inclusion and retail investor participation in the market. With other platforms such as the X-DataPortal, X-Factbook and X-Mobile, stakeholders are increasingly empowered to make sound investment decisions and maximise value.\n\nMTNN has certainly had an interesting journey with NGX. It would be recalled that on 16 May 2019, the company listed by introduction 20.35 billion ordinary shares of MTNN at N90 per share, on the Premium Board. This made MTNN the first telecommunications network provider to be listed on the NGX Premium Board, a listing segment for the elite group of issuers that meet The Exchange\u2019s most stringent corporate governance and listing standards. At the time of the listing, NGX noted that, \u201cHaving MTNN listed in our market is a testament of The Exchange\u2019s commitment to building a dynamic and inclusive market and creating channels for sustainable investment. This listing will promote liquidity for MTNN, enhance its value and increase transparency, as our platform remains one of the best avenues for raising capital and enabling sustainable growth for national development\u201d.\n\n2021 has certainly shaped up to be an exciting year for NGX and this MTNN PO is an interesting way to wrap up a year of many milestone achievements. Stakeholders are excited to see NGX live up to its commitment to be an open and vibrant exchange, constantly evolving to meet the needs of its stakeholders and look forward to many more strategic opportunities like this.",

He also denied being part of the campaign team of the All Progressives Congress and its candidate, Senator Andy Uba, in the recently conducted governorship election in the state.\n\nWhen asked if he was aware of the EFCC putting Obiano on its watch list, the minister said, \u201cI am in all sincerity not aware and I don\u2019t have to be aware because the EFCC is established by law and its responsibilities are demarcated by law.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has spoken out after receiving a letter from President Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) over the contentious Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nBuhari, who received the measure on November 19, has until December 19 to sign it or refuse to sign it and voice his thoughts and concerns to the National Assembly.\n\nAnd if after 30 days he refuses to sign the bill, and with the National Assembly not in support of the President\u2019s amendments or reservation, the Senate and the House of Representatives can recall the bill and pass it into law.\n\nShould the bill be passed in the form it was sent to the President by two-thirds majority votes in both chambers, the bill automatically becomes a law even without the signature of the President.\n\nBut reacting to the President\u2019s letter on Wednesday, INEC National Commissioner and chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said its position constitutionally, legally and administratively was that the electoral management body is the end user of the electoral legal framework.\n\nHe said that it was conventionally rational, strategic and fundamental to seek the opinion of the commission and other critical agencies in the electoral matrix before a new legal framework becomes law.\n\nOkoye said, \u201cPursuant to Section 58(4) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), the President has 30 days to assent to a bill presented to him by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe President has requested the commission and other critical national institutions to revert with detailed and considered views indicating whether or not the President should assent to the bill.\n\n\u201cThis is the democratic way to go and the commission will make its views known to the President bearing in mind the overriding national interest and interest of our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe commission will go through the bill and revert to the President within the time frame given to it.\u201d\n\nHe said INEC was aware that Nigerians were waiting for this bill and also conscious of the fact that a comprehensive, clear, unambiguous and forward-looking electoral legal framework was germane to early preparations for elections.\n\nHe said the regulations and guidelines of the commission are drawn from the Electoral Act and without a new electoral legal framework, the work of the commission will be tentative and that will not be good for the electoral process.\n\nSpeaking on the cost implications, Okoye said that it was rather unfortunate that the issue of direct or indirect primary had overshadowed other fundamental issues in the bill.\n\nHe said, \u201cHowever, it is difficult at this stage to speculate on the cost implications of direct primaries. As of today, the bill is inchoate until the President assents to it.\n\n\u201cIt is the constitutional and legal responsibility of the commission to give effect to laws passed by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cMoreover, direct primaries have been a feature of our electoral legal framework. The commission has monitored direct and indirect primaries organised by the different political parties. The commission does not dictate to political parties on the mode of primaries to adopt.\n\n\u201cThe new system of direct primary election proposed in the bill domiciles the conditions for the conduct of the primaries with the political parties. In other words, the procedure adopted for the direct primaries shall be spelt out in a guidelines to be issued by the political party and filed with the commission at least 14 days before the primary election.\u201d",

          "text": "Kunle Ajibade, a leader of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Lagos State, was assassinated by suspected hoodlums at Ijeshatedo, Surulere.\n\nThe assailants stabbed the 28-year-old at his home and followed him to a hospital where he was being treated, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nThey were said to have shot him multiple times.\n\nThe victim\u2019s brother, Kehinde, who urged the police to investigate the killing, said his brother was being rushed to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital when he gave up on the way.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that the circumstances surrounding Kunle\u2019s death started during a celebration tagged Prosper Day.\n\nThe party held last Saturday on Ijikoyijo Street, Ijeshatedo, where Kunle was the vice-chairman of the NURTW.\n\nMembers of two rival gangs reportedly attended the party to also catch fun.\n\nWhile one of the gang members was led by a man identified as My Son, the other gang was led by a transport worker identified as Kolom.\n\nKehinde said trouble started when one Malik, a member of Kolom\u2019s gang, started misbehaving after drinking to a stupor around 10pm.\n\nHe claimed that Malik\u2019s action infuriated members of the other gang, which led to a fight between the groups.\n\n\u201cAlso in Ijesha, there is a group known as the Ultimate, led by one Alaka.\n\n\u201cDuring the fight, members of the Ultimate group supported My Son group.\n\n\u201cKunle and some people tried to settle the fight. But Alaka became annoyed and engaged in a shouting match with my brother.\n\n\u201cOne of Alaka\u2019s boys, Jabi, even broke a bottle on my brother\u2019s head, but we ensured that the matter was settled for peace to reign. The party ended and everyone went home,\u201d Kehinde added.\n\nHe alleged that Alaka, however, led his gang to attack Kunle at midnight, adding that they stabbed him with different weapons, including machetes.\n\n\u201cI was asleep when my phone rang around 2am. I checked it and realised that it was my wife calling. I picked it, but my mother started speaking and she said I should go to Ijikoyijo Street because some people had used machetes to inflict serious wounds on Kunle.\n\n\u201cWhen I got there, I was told that they had taken my brother to a private hospital on Ogunmuyiwa Street. On my way there, I met his friends, who said while at the hospital, Alaka led his boys to attack the medical facility and shot my brother.\n\n\u201cThey shot him in the hand, back and thigh. Even without the gunshots, the probability of him surviving the injuries he suffered during the attack with machetes was low. They cut his hand and head. I have Alaka\u2019s voice recordings confirming that he attacked my brother.\n\n\u201cAfter the attack at the hospital, my brother\u2019s friends rushed him to the Adetutu Hospital on Kosoko Street in Ijesha. My mum and I went to meet him there and decided to rush him to LUTH because the injuries were serious. We hired a tricycle, but he died on the way,\u201d he added.\n\nA video clip showing Kunle\u2019s lifeless body in a tricycle was seen by our correspondent.\n\nHis left palm was severely cut; he was also hacked in the thigh, chest, back and laps.\n\nFriends and family members were also heard lamenting the death.\n\nThe victim\u2019s mother, Adeola, who demanded justice, said the case had been transferred from the Ijesha Police Station to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba.\n\nShe said, \u201cMy son died in my hands. He kept mentioning Alaka\u2019s name till he died. After his death, I called Alaka and told him that he killed my son. While my son has been buried, Alaka is still around and has not been arrested. I want justice.\u201d\n\nAlaka, however, denied killing Kunle, adding that he spoke angrily to his mother because she accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am not the one that led the attack. Kunle\u2019s mother is like a mother to me. When she called and accused me of attacking her son, because of the way she spoke, I got annoyed and talked to her rudely.\n\n\u201cI asked if she knew what her son did to me. I was shocked when I heard that Kunle was dead and I could not call her back again because of how I had spoken to her on the phone. His brother also called me and started cursing me and I became speechless.\n\n\u201cI never entered any hospital. Gang members from Itire came to the party. Kunle threw a bottle at me.

I equally wish to thank members of the South African delegation and the experts that worked tirelessly during the Senior Officials Meeting.\n\n\u201dToday, has witnessed the signing of new Memoranda of Understanding between Nigeria and South Africa in diverse areas including Youth Development, Women and Child Empowerment and Political Consultations; critical areas that will lead to increased people to people contact.\n\n\u201dAlso, existing MOUs signed during previous Bi-National Commission meetings were also reviewed. These include MOUs on Military Cooperation, Power, Cooperation in the field of Geology, Mining, and Mineral Processing, Oil and Gas and several others.\n\n\u201dToday, we also jointly launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue, another veritable tool for interaction among our youth with the aim of creating shared values and aspiration. Many of our youth, from Nigeria and South Africa joined us virtually during the launch,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked his colleague for initiating the Youth Dialogue, noting that continuous interaction between the youth of the two countries would further break barriers and suspicion among our people.\n\nHe added that the inauguration of the Joint Ministerial Advisory Council on Industry, Trade and Investment, would enable the private sectors of the two largest economies in Africa to further promote economic cooperation and development.\n\n\u201dWe appreciate that we need to do much more to achieve further integration of our two economies and take full advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\n\u201dOnce again, I wish to thank my brother President and members of the South African delegation for their visit and their wonderful friendship, cooperation and solidarity,\u201d he said.\n\nRamaphosa\n\nIn his remarks, President Ramaphosa thanked the leaders of Nigeria, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal for expressing their dissatisfaction with the travel ban imposed on South Africa and sister neighbouring countries in the aftermath of the discovery of the Omicron COVID-19 variant by South African scientists.\n\nHe described the imposition of the ban by some western countries as arbitrary, discriminatory, unscientific and unproductive in the long run.\n\n\u201dThis is a global pandemic and overcoming it requires that we collaborate and work together as a collective.\n\n\u201dThe resulting damage to this travel ban to the economies of the countries affected will be considerable and long lasting.\n\n\u201dSo I want to use this opportunity to tell the countries that have imposed this ban to reverse their decisions whether they are the northern more developed economies or in other parts of our continent or elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\n3 Omicron variant, 105 COVID-19 cases\n\nMeanwhile, The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Wednesday announced fresh 105 COVID-19 infections just as Nigeria joined the growing list of countries that have recorded the new Omicron variant with the detection of 3 cases in the country.\n\nThe agency stated this in its daily report in Abuja.\n\nThe 105 additional cases, NCDC said, is an increase from the 21 cases reported in the country the previous day, warning that Nigeria was at the risk of registering high incidences of the new variant due to neglect of preventive measures at airports and other points of entry in the country.\n\nThe latest additional cases which were recorded in 8 states and the FCT, showed the country now had a total of 214,218 COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\nIt listed the states that recorded the new COVID-19 cases to include Lagos (43), Gombe (21), FCT (16), Niger (10), Rivers (6), Plateau (5), Edo (2), Bauchi (1), and Kano (1).\n\nThe NCDC said 12 people had recovered from the infection as at Tuesday, while the total number of discharged cases now stood at 207,304 nationwide.",

          "text": "\u2026Says challenges undermining national unity can no longer be ignored\n\nThe immediate past chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega, has called on elected leaders at all levels to address the smouldering crisis arising from regional agitations across Nigeria to safeguard the unity of the country.\n\nHe specifically enjoined the leaders to consciously promote and uphold the rule of law in order to engender peace and harmony.\n\nAccording to him, national unity in a diverse country like Nigeria is not easy to attain due to what he called \u201cethno-linguistic differences, social and religious identities, which ordinarily foster and bolster prejudice and obstinacy, which are susceptible to mobilisation and manipulation by ethno-religious elite.\u201d\n\nProfessor Jega spoke in a keynote address at the National Unity Summit 2021, entitled Nigeria: \u201cThe Imperative of Unity\u201d organised by the National Prosperity Movement (NPM) Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nThe former INEC boss said the tensions that sparked off agitations across the country were linked to crises of inequality, marginalisation and outright denial of citizens\u2019 rights to harmonious co-existence among others.\n\nHe also fingered at \u201cincompetent and parochial leaders\u201d for the surge of regional and sectional violence and security challenges across the country, saying \u201cnational unity has to be deliberately forged, nurtured and entrenched through citizenship mobilization, sensitisation and education, as well as through policies and programmes for actualising the goal of unity in diversity and national integration.\u201d\n\nThe former university vice chancellor highlighted the major threats to national unity to include; negative mobilisation of ethno-religious and other primordial identities, especially in contestations for power in electoral politics, hate speeches targeted at perceived \u2018others\u2019, in an \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 categorisations, reckless peddling of misinformation, giving primacy to \u2018indigenes\u2019 over \u2018citizenship\u2019 rights in state and local governance, Boko Haram insurgency, and irredentist militancy in the South-east and South-south among others.\n\n\u201cThere is in present day Nigeria evidence of remarkable erosion of national unity and seeming whittling down if not abandonment of yester-years lofty projects of national integration. The resurgence of, and violent activism by, insurgents and irredentist militants with a clear agenda for dismemberment of Nigeria, is indicative of the sorry state of national unity.\n\n\u201cSo is the increasingly indifferent and apathetic disposition of teeming youth with regards to serious national affairs, which ordinarily would require their active engagement. Indeed, many young men and women are frustrated that they are diverting their energies to aggressive behaviour and creativity to all sorts of criminality. Some have even given up on Nigeria and are merely looking for opportunities to \u2018check-out\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis situation needs to be effectively and decisively addressed. The imperative of national unity is of such importance that the challenges undermining it can no longer be ignored, and all hands need to, have to, be on deck to find lasting solutions to them.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Director General of the National Prosperity Movement, Ahmad Sajoh said NPM\u2019s conviction for organising the summit was predicated on the belief that, as a society, Nigerians were greater than the challenges confronting them.\n\nThose who graced the summit included Ekiti state Governor Dr Kayode Fayemi and General IBM Haruna, who was chairman of the occasion, among several others.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

An unconditional release of Kanu, who is standing trial, according to the President, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the executive and judiciary.\n\nStressing his policy of non-interference with the Judiciary, he said when Kanu jumped bail, got arrested, and was brought back to the country.\n\n\u201cI said the best thing was to subject him to the system,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nPresident Buhari further stated that Kanu should go make his case in court instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from outside.",

These cases were recent arrivals in the country in the past week.\n\n\u201cFollow up to ensure isolation, linkage to clinical care, contact tracing and other relevant response activities have commenced. Arrangements are also being made to notify country where travel originated according to the provisions of the International Health Regulations.\u201d\n\n[READ ALSO] Omicron Variant: Canada Bans Travellers From Nigeria, Egypt And Malawi\n\nAccording to him, the NCDC assumes Omicron is widespread globally given the increasing number of countries reporting the variant.\n\nAdetifa gave an assurance that the NCDC would continue to expand its sequencing capacity in-country through a network of public health laboratories and other partners.\n\nThe focus for the agency, he stated, was to complete sequencing of recently accrued samples of SARS-COV-2 positive travellers from all countries, especially those from countries that have reported the Omicron variant already.\n\nThe NCDC chief revealed that since reports of the emergence of the Omicron variant, the Federal Ministry of Health, through the NCDC, has intensified public health response measures to COVID-19.\n\nHe added that the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 has revised the national travel advisory, which included a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure by all inbound travellers to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPre-booking and payment for all day 2 and day 7 COVID-19 PCR tests are prerequisites for travel. In addition, all outbound passengers regardless of the requirements of destination countries are expected to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country as we combat the pandemic and these emerging variants, including the Delta variant,\u201d Adetifa pleaded.",

This represents 51% of the 451 certificates on which responses have been received from the awarding institutions.

          "title": "Omicron: Nigeria to Push for Mass Vaccination, Not Travel Ban \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "As countries around the world try to figure out ways to deal with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has said it will not join countries imposing travel ban on some nations and regions. NCDC said, instead, it would encourage more Nigerians to get vaccinated, while enhancing surveillance and vigilance.\n\nDirector-General of the centre, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, disclosed this on Wednesday on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d.\n\nAdetifa confirmed that the country now had cases of the new virus strain.\n\nIn a related development, NCDC said it had begun contact tracing on three persons who tested positive for the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nHe explained that regardless of his recommendations from a technical perspective, a ban was not on the cards for the NCDC.\n\nAdetifa, however said surveillance would be an on-going activity, as the agency continued to generate results from the laboratory, tests, case identification, and sequencing, which will be on a daily basis.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are currently the subject of travel bans ourselves for reasons that are not driven by science. From the perspective of NCDC, we give technical advice, and this is based on risk assessments of transmission from countries where intending travellers are coming from.\n\n\u201cSo, as recommended, if you follow science-driven process, you review the epidemiological situation in those countries, you review the genomic and surveillance data in those countries and then you make a decision based on the risk of importation and the risk of transmission.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that it would not be surprising if more cases were discovered as they continued to sequence the samples, saying this is reflective of the situation worldwide.\n\nOn measures taken so far by the federal government to curtail the spread of the new variant, Adetifa noted that surveillance was in top gear.\n\nHe said, \u201cCountries are required to conduct a risk based assessment of transmission and we are enhancing surveillance in terms of looking at travellers, and ensuring that travellers adhere to all of the travel advisory regarding Day 2 testing and Day 7 testing for the appropriate category. In addition we are prioritising and sequencing, as recommended, for all incoming travellers.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cThe treatment centres across the country are still there, oxygen plants, oxygen supply, to take care of any potential increase in case numbers requiring hospitalisation. We\u2019ve not recorded any fatalities. That there\u2019s a new variant does not really change what we do\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the effectiveness of the public health measures. As recommended, it doesn\u2019t change the requirement for vaccination or the benefits that are likely to accrue for vaccination, regardless of what the variant goes over.\u201d\n\nAdetifa encouraged Nigerians to get vaccinated, explaining that vaccines prevent transmission, reduces transmission if infections should occur and also protect severe disease and death.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the last Peace and Security Council (PSC) press conference, I highlighted how almost all of the deaths in the last two months under review occurred in people who are unvaccinated. So vaccines have the benefits and I hope that with partners in the media, with civil society organisations and everybody else, we will continue to sensitise our fellow citizens to really make use of every opportunity that they have to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the NCDC data collection, he explained that collation was done in the interest of transparency, stressing, \u201cWhat we have seen, again, in the past weeks, obviously, as part of a feature of pandemic fatigue and similar to what\u2019s been reported everywhere else is that there\u2019s been a drop in testing for a few weeks before the last one. But we have seen an uptick in testing as a result of all of the efforts put in place to try and get states and people who are at the frontline to return to testing.\n\n\u201cIt has also gone up in response to our interventions and continued rollouts of rapid diagnostic tests to make this test more accessible, more readily available and easier to do than the reference test, which is PCR. We will continue to do that over the coming weeks. In fact, we are in the process of consolidating testing guidelines, we are preparing for a massive rollout of rapid diagnostic tests as a means of shoring up and ensuring completeness of surveillance.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NCDC, in a statement, explained that the move to carry out contact tracing followed the confirmation of the first positive case of the new COVID-19 variant by the agency yesterday morning. It said the possibility of more cases being detected in the country could not be ruled out since Omicron variant was now widespread globally, given the increasing number of countries reporting the variant.\n\nIt stated that it had activated its contact tracing mechanism by undertaking a follow up to ensure isolation, and linkage to clinical care for the affected persons.\n\nNCDC stated, \u201cContact tracing and other relevant response activities had commenced.\u201d\n\nThe centre noted that arrangements were also being made to notify the country where the traveller originated from, according to the provisions of the International Health Regulations.\n\nNCDC said samples of three persons with history of travel to South Africa were confirmed positive.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cIn line with the routine travel test required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC through its National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja, Nigeria confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, also known as the B.1.1.529 lineage.\n\n\u201cThis genomic surveillance has now identified and confirmed Nigeria\u2019s first cases of the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 lineage, now known as the Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cSamples obtained for the stipulated Day Two test for all travellers to Nigeria were positive for this variant in three persons with history of travel to South Africa. These cases were recent arrivals in the country in the past week.\u201d\n\nNCDC further stated that it was conducting sequencing of all blood samples of SARS-COV-2 positive travellers from all countries, especially countries that had reported the Omicron variant.\n\nThe NCDC statement said, \u201cSince reports of the emergence of this Omicron variant, the Federal Ministry of Health, through the NCDC, has intensified public health response measures to COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe national travel advisory has also been revised by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and now requires all inbound travellers to Nigeria present a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cPre-booking and payment for all Day 2 and Day 7 COVID-19 PCR tests are prerequisites for travel. In addition, all outbound passengers, regardless of the requirements of destination countries, are expected to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country as we combat the pandemic and these emerging variants, including the Delta variant.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja,\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Japan says it has retracted a ban on new incoming international flight bookings to defend against the new variant of the coronavirus only a day after the policy was announced, following criticisms that it was an overreaction.\n\nThe transport ministry on Wednesday issued a request to international airlines to stop taking new reservations for flights coming into Japan until the end of December as an emergency precaution to defend against the new omicron variant.\n\nThe ministry said Thursday it has retracted the request after receiving criticisms that the ban was too strict and tantamount to abandoning its own people.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida said the quick reversal of the policy took into consideration Japanese nationals\u2019 traveling needs.

          "text": "Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), yesterday, justified the government\u2019s White Paper on the Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) report on the October 2020 Lekki tollgate incident, saying the government complied with the laws and the weight of evidence presented at the panel to reach a decision.\n\nAccording to him, the position of the Government as stated in the White Paper was not contrary to the panel\u2019s findings, especially, the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, who said only three of the bodies that he conducted post mortem examination on during the EndSARS protests, were from Lekki, and out of whom only one had gunshot injury.\n\nOnigbanjo, who spoke during a Morning Show programme on the ARISE News on Wednesday, said inconsistencies and contradictions in the leaked reports of the panel that nine people died at the Lekki tollgate made the panel\u2019s finding in respect to deaths at the tollgate unreliable, adding that for a finding that somebody died at a scene to be acceptable, there must be no doubt.\n\n\u201cThe position of Lagos State Government is based on the findings of the panel itself. So, it is not that Lagos State Government just conjured things from the air. We went through the report and what we saw particularly in reference to the death of nine persons is that they found the evidence of the Pathologist, Prof. Obafunwa, who conducted an autopsy on all the bodies picked up all over Lagos during the protests, not just at Lekki Tollgate but statewide, credible and there was no evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cProf. Obafunwa said of all the bodies he conducted autopsies on, three came from Lekki and out of the three only one had gunshot injuries. And the panel then said we believe you;we accept your evidence, because there is nothing to the contrary. So, in law, if you put that on the imaginary scale, it means what Prof. Obafunwa said outweighs every other evidence before the panel,\u201d he said.\n\nOnigbanjo further debunked the allegations that the panel made no reference to policemen nor took them into consideration.\n\n\u201cThey (JPI) issued two reports. The report that leaked only dealt with the issues from the Lekki Toll Gate. There is another report, which they issued which was not leaked; that report deals with all the EndSARS petitions that were about 253 in number and of the 253, policemen also brought their own petitions and in that report, the panel awarded a sum of about N36.2million to the policemen, who were affected one way or the other by the protests.\n\n\u201cSo, to be fair to them, they did consider the plights of the policemen too. And even if you look at most of their recommendations, they are for better welfare for the police, better equipment, more training, psychological evaluations. So, they took them into consideration,\u201d he said.\n\nThe attorney-general, however, denied the allegations that Lagos State Government was put under pressure by the federal government to discredit the panel\u2019s report, adding that at no time did the state government encourage personal attacks against any members of the panel.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe federal government never put the Lagos State Government under any pressure to discredit the panel or anybody. If you check the records, nobody from Lagos State Government discredited the panel. In fact, they submitted the report on the 15th of November 2021, the governor praised them and thanked them for the job they did.\n\n\u201cEven yesterday, in his speech, which he made before the White Paper was released, he thanked them again. So, nobody from the Lagos State Government directly or indirectly has sought to discredit members of the panel. We appreciate the job they did for almost 13 months. We do not condone such attacks on anybody.\n\n\u201cI think we have conducted ourselves in such a manner that we strive to always do what is right. We complied with the law; we set up the panel. So, if we didn\u2019t even want the panel, there are so many ways it could have been stopped. They asked for an extension, we gave them. The initial funding was N200million; they exhausted it and asked for more, we gave them.\n\n\u201cWe appointed independent-minded people into the panel. And the panel itself said in its report that they give credit to the Lagos State Government for allowing them to be completely independent. Lagos State Government has fulfilled all its promises to the public. We set up an independent panel, we said we will release a White Paper and we did. We have complied with the law all the way.\u201d\n\nSegun James, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie",
