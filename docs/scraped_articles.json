          "text": "The Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama on Sunday said there was nothing to celebrate on Nigeria\u2019s democracy day because of corruption, hunger and other vices which have become a norm.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria was near collapse as the high level of inflation, unemployment, and hunger have remained worrisome.\n\nKaigama who stated these in his Homily delivered at St. Augustine Parish in Dutse-Sangbagyi Abuja said that corruption had become a norm of bad conduct in the public offices occupied by successive politicians.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe should be joyfully celebrating democracy Day today, June 12. But how can we when corruption seems to be institutionalised in a manner that it is okay to spend humongous amounts of money to influence voters and still believe that if such people are elected to political power they will provide transparent governance with honest economic policies?\n\n\u201cHow do we celebrate in the midst of escalating prices of essential commodities, hunger and unemployment? How do we celebrate democracy when yet-to-be-identified gunmen pose such a grievous setback in our march towards harmonious and peaceful co-existence? How do we celebrate when corrupt governance and insecurity threaten the present and future of Nigerians?\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our country seems to be driven by ideologies and interests that only favour a given few.\u201d\n\nRead Also Buhari greets Kaigama on installation as Archbishop of Abuja\n\nThe Archbishop accused political of insensitivity, saying that it was disheartening that one week after the carnage at St. Francis Xavier Parish in Owo, Ondo State, the authorities have no immediate verifiable security evidence of the attackers.\n\n\u201cAll that our leaders care about now is guaranteeing their political future, and oblivious of the rude happenings, they go on to spend incredible amounts in both local and foreign currencies to get elected.\n\n\u201cWe pray that someday, we may truly become one nation bound in freedom, peace and unity, when Christians, Muslims and traditional religious worshippers will come together to unmask marauders living among us, now emboldened by the poor action of government and the relevant security agencies\u201d, he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nRenew call for redeployment of Osun Police Commissioner\n\nShina Abubakar, Osogbo\n\nAs Nigeria marks Democracy Day, coalition of civil societies in Osun stressed the need for government at all levels to double their efforts in the safety of lives and property, as well as guarantee a transparent process, as the nation moves to another election year.\n\nSpeaking under the aegis of Osun Civil Societies Coalition (OCSC), at the annual June 12 rally in Osogbo, lamented over the state of insecurity in the country, expressing disappointment that 23 years after, Nigerians are still facing hardship in all strata of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMKO Abiola represented Hope for a better Nigeria. It is unfortunate that 29 years after the annulment of June 12, Nigeria is still far from its expected development pedestal. It is so unfortunate that even since the return of democracy, our politicians have continued to re-echo the campaign manifesto of the Shagari regime in 1976, as their agenda for Nigeria close to five decades after.\n\n\u201cWe still premise our yardstick of good governance to building roads, schools, providing potable water, electricity and the basic necessities for survival, when other nations have moved beyond the basics.\n\n\u201cWe cannot over-emphasize how badly we need a working democracy where the will of the people will suppress the desire of the minority, who have been opportuned to continue to rule us, will manifest.\n\n\u201cThe primary responsibility of every government is provision of adequate security for the protection of lives and property. With starring facts and incidents, Nigeria is far from winning the war against insurgencies, banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery, etc.\n\n\u201cThe recent attack on a catholic church in Owo where many people were killed with scores injured is a sorrowful evidence that insecurity still pervades the country. We condemn the Owo massacre and call on the security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of such dastard act.\u201d\n\nAddressing the members of the public at strategic places when members of the coalition including students, businessmen and women and pro-democracy activism who moved through Ayetoro, Igbona, Olonkoro, Ajegunle, Old Garage, Oke-fia to Olaiya junction all in the state capital, a leader of the movement, Comrade Waheed Saka, called for immediate transfer of the Osun Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode.\n\nSaka condemned the continued harassment, intimidation and killing of harmless citizens by policemen, with a call on the Inspector General of Police to rescue the residents of Osun from Olokode, and \u201chis trigger-happy and blood sucking men.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWithin a year, Osun has recorded no fewer than four deaths to police brutality and extra-judicial killings which crowns the gross misconduct and anti-democracy tenets experienced by Nigerians, pre and post 1999.\n\n\u201cA borehole operator, Kabiru Babai was shot dead by a policeman at Ota-efun, Osogbo, on December 3, 2021. On July 27, 2021, Mr Saheed Olabomi, a relative of Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oba Abdulrasheed Olabomi, was also shot dead by a mobile policeman at Islahudeen Area, Oke-Onitea, Osogbo. Also, on April 4, 2022 Mr Abiola Afolabi, a young businessman was shot dead in the middle of the night by the police at Zone II, Osogbo. A 24-year-old man, Olufemi Oriyomi, was allegedly tortured to death by the police. On May 31, a journalist, Toba Adedeji was also shot by the police who were dispersing protesters at Olaiya, Osogbo, with live bullets.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Wale Olokode, has always been manipulating facts on cases of police brutality and extrajudicial killings. We demand that the Inspector General of Police should investigate all the cases of police extortion, illegal arrest and detention, brutality and extrajudicial killings, among other misconducts where characterised the police operations under the leadership of CP Wale Olokode.\n\n\u201cEqually, we want CP Wale Olokode to be transferred out of Osun because of his brazen neglect and continued shield for his trigger-happy officials. The conduct of the police boss have so far shown how inhumane, selfish and unpatriotic he is to the sanctity of lives which he swore to protect.\u201d",

He has made series of nominations into President Buhari\u2019s Cabinet and Federal parastatals as it concerns the welfare and appointment of Ndigbo.\n\nThe Igbo leader of thought assured the APC presidential candidate of the support of well meaning Ndigbo leaders of APC in Ebonyi State and other stakeholders within the South East region of the country as he (Tinubu) prepares to embark on his electioneering campaigns across the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to call on Nigerians to disregard such information.

He is a lover of Ndigbo. His love for Ndigbo is also seen in the appointment of Ndigbo into the present administration in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s this expression of hate and Political mischief be put aside for the purpose of national development and the unity of this country. I want to urge mischief makers and Political blackmailers to stop this unscrupulous and meaningless publication against Tinubu as the PVC registration is open to all.\n\n\u201cIt is a fake and false news.

They should be part of the decision making.\n\nMeanwhile, in his Democracy Day message, Abiru called on Nigerians to foster national unity, stressing that there is still\n\nhope for the nation.\n\nThe Chairman, Senate Committee on Industries, noted that the great nations of the world that are celebrated today have had their fair share of national tribulations and challenges in their journey into nationhood.\n\nHe said, \u201cI join esteemed constituents of the Lagos East Senatorial District and Nigerians in general in commemorating 2022 Democracy Day.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the democratic journey that started in 1999 is not without hiccups. The challenges notwithstanding, we should not be quick to dismiss commemoration of Democracy Day especially the tortuous June 12 struggle as non-event.\n\n\u201cNations that are celebrated for their high democratic ethos today have had their own share of tribulations in their journey. The United States of America that is reputed as the bastion of the world\u2019s democracy is obviously not without her challenges.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker added, \u201cDespite imperfections and challenges, I urge all Nigerians not to despair but rather continue to seek ways of consolidating gains of the nation\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\n\u201c\u2019As we get set for the 2023 general elections, I call on all eligible residents in the Lagos East Senatorial District in particular and Nigeria in general to register for their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and ensure they discharge their civic duty during elections.\n\n\u201cOur challenges are daunting but not insurmountable. Let\u2019s keep hope alive. Nigeria shall be great again,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "In continuation of its efforts to encourage transparency and accountability by states governments, the World Bank is set to release $750 million, it was learnt at the weekend.\n\nThe facility is the second tranche of a $1.5 billion plan between the World Bank and the Federal Government, which intention is, apart from fiscal transparency, is sustainable growth. The multilateral facility is channeled through the Federal Government.\n\nSources at the weekend, said the disbursement will commence within the next 14 days.\n\nThe incentivized scheme known as States Fiscal Transparency Accountability and Sustainability (SFTAS) is a conditional grant with the states expected to achieve certain Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in order to qualify for the new disbursement in 2022.\n\nAlso, further evaluation of earlier disbursements to determine how the first tranche was utilised will be conducted in some states by the World Bank.\n\nThe $750 million World Bank grant is designed to strengthen the fiscal transparency, accountability and sustainability in Nigerian states as a way of improving their revenue base, increasing fiscal efficiency in public expenditure and reducing debt overhang.\n\nFor the states to meet the DLIs, the federal government requires states must show evidence of citizens\u2019 input from formal public consultations as published online, along with the proposed fiscal year budget and citizens\u2019 budget based on approved state budget published online by, altogether with functional online feedback mechanisms.\n\nThe state governments are also required to create citizens accountability report based on audited financial statements and reports published online for fiscal year 2020 not later than end of September 2021.\n\nThe World Bank is supporting the federal government with the two-tranche $1.5 billion to incentivise the states to properly achieve federal government\u2019s 22-point Fiscal Sustainability Plan.\n\nTo benefit from the grant, state governments are required to achieve improved financial reporting and budget reliability; increased openness and citizens\u2019 engagement in the budget process; improved cash management and reduced revenue leakages through the implementation of State Treasury Single Account (TSA); strengthened internally generated revenue (IGR) collection; biometric registration and Bank Verification Number (BVN) used to reduce payroll fraud.\n\nSFTAS is now under full implementation with all 36 states participating in the programme. In 2018, the first performance year, 24 states met the eligibility criteria and achieved on average five DLI results each.\n\nThere are indications that the SFTAS is achieving its aims. Already, two-thirds of states are engaging citizens in their budget process and publishing citizens\u2019 budgets; 17 states have achieved annual IGR growth of at least 20 per cent in 2019 of which 11 States increased their IGR by more than 40 per cent.\n\nIn addition, two-thirds of the states are addressing payroll fraud through linking biometric data and BVN to payroll; two-thirds of the states passed fiscal responsibility and public debt laws and several states have started to clear their domestic expenditure arrears; owed to contractors, civil servants and pensioners.",

          "text": "By Nwanosike Onu, Awka; Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu and Chris Njoku, Owerri\n\nEbonyi State Governor David Umahi came under fire yesterday for attacking President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor.\n\nUmahi blamed Prof Obiozor for the poor outing of Southeast presidential aspirants at the All Progressives Congress (APC) convention.\n\nAPC national leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu won the primary with 1,271 votes.\n\nUmahi came a distant sixth, polling 38 votes, ahead of other Southeast aspirants Ogbonnaya Onu and Emeka Nwaujiba, both of whom got a vote each, and Senator Rochas Okorocha, who got none.\n\nUmahi, speaking at the maiden matriculation of King David University of Medical Sciences, accused the Ohanaeze leadership of abandoning the Southeast president project.\n\nHe claimed that Prof Obiozor and other leaders and delegates from the zone were never sincere about their demand for a president of Southeast extraction.\n\nThe Ebonyi governor said: \u201cProf. Obiozor could not stand for Igbos when it mattered so much. It is a very big shame.\n\n\u201cI have no confidence in him and he is no longer my president.\u201d\n\nBut, Ohanaeze Vice President (Southeast), Ichie Damian Okeke-Ogene, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Chief Mike Ahamba and an Igbo think thank, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), slammed Umahi for the comments, which they described as insulting.\n\nOkeke-Ogene believes Umahi should share the blame for failing to rally other governors of the zone.\n\nHe said: \u201cUmahi as the leader of the Southeast governors forum is partly to blame.\n\n\u201cFor over a year now or thereabouts, how many times have they held a meeting of the forum?\n\nRead Also: Umahi slams betrayal by Southeast delegates at presidential primaries\n\n\u201cOhanaeze\u2019s role is advisory. Since the centre cannot hold, what do you expect Ohanaeze to do?\n\n\u201cEveryone is paying the price. Ohanaeze is a socio-cultural organisation and not a political party.\u201d\n\nChief Ahamba described Umahi\u2019s comments as childish and demeaning.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf Umahi said that, I consider such a statement as very childish and demeaning of a governor of a state.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Prof Obiozor was not at the convention and is not the governor\u2019s personal President General but President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo which covers all the states.\n\n\u201cWhat does he expect Prof Obiozor to do? Prof Obiozor is not part of the delegates.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell the delegates not to vote for him and he was not the only contestant from the Southeast.\u201d\n\nThe ADF asked Umahi to apologise to Ohanaeze and the entire Igbo people for his scathing remarks against its leadership.\n\nThe group also accused the governor and his colleagues of betraying Ndigbo by not strengthening the region\u2019s security.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said Umahi does not have a moral basis to accuse Ohanaeze Ndigbo of betrayal.\n\n\u201cUmahi lost a legitimate right to accuse Ohanaeze of betrayal. This is because he and other governors betrayed Ndigbo and Ohanaeze itself by not protecting the region.\n\n\u201cUmahi is the Chairman of the Southeast Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze entrusted the security of the Southeast in his care with the other governors.\n\n\u201cThey were told to set up a regional security outfit, to which they agreed.\n\n\u201cWhen it was already belated, he went ahead to form the so-called Ebube-Agu which the opposition in Ebonyi now claims he uses as a personal security outfit.\n\n\u201cNow that he has lost, he is turning back to blame Ohanaeze Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cThat is an insult to Ndigbo. Umahi should withdraw that statement and apologise to Ohanaeze Ndigbo\u201d.\n\nA top chieftain of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, who pleaded not to be named, said Umahi\u2019s annoyance was that he expected Prof Obiozor to present him to President Muhammadu Buhari as the sole candidate of Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi expected Prof Obiozor to present him to the President when he visited Ebonyi, but Prof Obiozor could not honour his invitation to make such pronouncement.\n\n\u201cProf Obiozor did not go to Ebonyi because he felt that Governor Umahi was not the only aspirant from Southeast. That was the beginning of the problem.\n\n\u201cProf Obiozor could not have presented Umahi to the President when other aspirants were also bent on contesting the primary election.\u201d",

The Governors sympathise with the victims of the mindless attack in Owo.\n\n\u201cThe Governors agreed to declare a three day mourning period in memory of the victims of the 5th June, 2022 terror attack on St Francis Catholic, Owaluwa Street, Owo, Ondo State, starting from Monday, 13th June to Wednesday, 15th, June, 2022 to symbolise our collective loss across all South Western States in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that all the Governors should direct the flying of Flags at half mast in all public buildings, facilities and official residences across all the states of the South West in honour of the victims of the Owo attack.\n\n\u201cThe Governors noted, with great discomfiture, the increasing agitations about spaces taken over by unidentified and unknown migrants in all South West States. The meeting, therefore, recommends an increase in the scope of surveillance of the activities of these undocumented settlers by relevant security agencies in all the States.\n\n\u201cThe Governors, as Chief Security Officers, resolved to continue to assist the security agencies in the areas of crisis management and intelligence gathering at ALL times.\n\n\u201cThe Governors reviewed reports from various States on the factors militating against peace and security in the region. They expressed grave concern on the influx of Okada riders into all parts of the South West, especially the State capitals. The meeting further resolved that efforts be geared toward identity management of Okada riders and stringent regulation put in place for their operation.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Forum decided it was time to reconvene the South West Security Committee to look critically into this creeping menace before it blossoms into another intractable social problem. The Committee will be expected to submit its findings on the desirability of Okada operations in the region. It is also expected to submit a multi-level template to combat the threat of insurgency and terrorism in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Forum agreed to convene forthwith a physical meeting of the South West Governors to deliberate on the security challenges confronting the region, it added.",

          "title": "Buhari: We Must Never Forget the Sacrifices of Heroes of Nigeria\u2019s Democracy",
          "text": "For the record\n\nMuhammadu Buhari\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June the 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\nIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\nWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\nFellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nIt is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nI am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\nI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\nAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\nAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\nI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\nFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\nThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\nI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\nOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\nFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\nWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\nOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\nI will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\nI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u2022 Being an address by President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of the commemoration and celebration of Democracy Day 2022\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Wants candidates to run issue-based campaign\n\n*Knocks Babangida\u2019s govt for annuling June 12, 1993 presidential poll\n\n*Atiku, Gbajabiamila, Tinubu, Obaseki, Sanwo-Olu, others urge Nigerians to remain hopeful\n\n*Akeredolu cancels Democracy Day celebration over Owo carnage\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Gboyega Akinsamni, Segun James in Lagos and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nWith less than a year to the end of his eight-year tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari has promised Nigerians that his administration will conduct a free, fair and transparent general election in the country in 2023.\n\nWhile charging candidates in the scheduled polls to run an issue-based campaign, the president emphasised that his government would do everything possible to address the issue of terrorist attacks in some parts of the country.\n\nPresident Buhari also gave hard knocks to the retired General Ibrahim Babangida-led military government for annulling the June 12, 1993, presidential election won by the late business mogul, Chief M K O Abiola.\n\nAlso on the occasion of the Democracy Day, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general election, Atiku Abubakar; his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterpart, Senator Bola Tinubu; the Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki; Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and human rights activist and President of Women Arise, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, have urged Nigerians not give up on hope.\n\nThis is coming as the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has cancelled the celebration of Democracy Day in the state due to last Sunday\u2019s attack on the St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo.\n\nIn a national broadcast this morning to commemorate the celebration of this year\u2019s Democracy Day, President Buhari assured Nigerians of a free, fair and transparent electoral process come 2023, while also pleading with all citizens to come together and work with the government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nHe charged the citizens to also support the electoral process that would deliver the desired results, especially in honour and memory of the June 12 icon, the late Chief MKO Abiola.\n\nHe stated that he would remain committed and determined to ensure that the new president is elected in 2023 through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nHe charged Nigerians, especially those who would be involved in electoral campaigns, to ensure that the process is sustained in maturity, devoid of the \u2018do-or-die\u2019 spirit.\n\nPresident Buhari also charged politicians and their followers to run their campaigns with a high sense of maturity and dignity, which had been sustained throughout the various parties\u2019 primaries.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u2018do or die affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n\u201cI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue-focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase the high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide an example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n\u201cFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last seven years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes,\u201d Buhari explained.\n\nCommenting on security challenges facing the nation and how they could affect the coming elections, President Buhari said the government was working to contain the issues so that the 2023 elections could be preserved and secure.\n\nHis words: \u201cI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of the government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we can prevent a crime, not after the crime has been committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n\u201cFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nBuhari also flayed the administration of former military president, General Babangida, which annulled the June 12, 1993, presidential poll adjudged as the freest election ever conducted in the electoral history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn June 12, 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24, 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n\u201cWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future,\u201d Buhari explained.\n\nAtiku, Gbajabiamila, Tinubu, Obaseki, Others Urge Nigerians to Remain Hopeful\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement Atiku signed as part of the 2022 Democracy Day message, the former vice president said the celebration should provide Nigerians with no room to stomach rhyme and rhetoric, but salient facts, sobriety and the promise of a better tomorrow.\n\nHe described it as an auspicious period to rally around all compatriots, to think and work in concert for the unity, security, equity, inclusivity, socio-economic prosperity and equitable development of our country.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s gather the numbers and commitment to kick out APC \u2013 the borrowing and sorrowing party. Let\u2019s remember that Nigeria\u2019s current debt burden stands at over N41 trillion with less than $40billion reserve\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Tinubu in his June 12 message, said although Nigerians are diverse in terms of ethnicity and religion, everyone seeks good governance, better life and the positive things that result from sustained good governance.\n\nAccording to him, \u201con this day, June 12, we celebrate democracy and commemorate those who have sacrificed so much to establish this most benign and noble form of governance in our land.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Gbajabiamila said Nigerians have a lot to celebrate as the country\u2019s democracy has developed in the past twenty-three years.\n\nHe expressed delight at how the citizens have embraced democratic governance in the past two decades, saying there is a lot to come in the coming years in terms of dividends of democracy.\n\nIn his message, Obaseki tasked Nigerians to uphold the ideals of the nation\u2019s founding fathers, who fought assiduously for the realisation of an independent country rooted in the values of justice and equity.\n\nThe governor urged citizens to recommit to the process of \u201crenewing ourselves and work in unison to make our country live up to its promise as the greatest black nation on earth.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Sanwo-Olu urged Lagosians to let Democracy Day be a reminder of the importance of joining hands to build the future they want.\n\nHe said since the ultimate goal of democracy is to improve the lives of the people, his government has resolved not take this responsibility lightly at all.\n\nSimilarly, human rights activist and President of Women Arise, Dr Okei-Odumakin, in a statement, warned that as the scramble for 2023 gathers speed, the import of June 12, 1993, must remain in the mind of Nigerians as nothing has changed.\n\nAkeredolu Cancels Democracy Day Celebration over Owo Carnage\n\nIn another development, Ondo State Governor, Akeredolu has cancelled the celebration of Democracy Day in the state due to last Sunday\u2019s attack on the St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo. Akeredolu announced the cancellation on his official Twitter handle, @RotimiAkeredolu yesterday.\n\nIn his tweet, Akeredolu said: \u201cIn honour of the victims of the terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, the Ondo State Government has cancelled this year\u2019s June 12 celebration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cancellation is to enable the people of Ondo State to mourn their loved ones who lost their lives in the horrific attack.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the South-west Speakers have condemned the gruesome attack on Owo Catholic church.\n\nIn a statement by the Chairman, South-west Speaker\u2019s Conference, Hon. Bamidele Oleyelogun also commiserated with Akeredolu.\n\nOleyelogun, who is the Speaker Ondo State House of Assembly, said the ancient town of Owo, which was known for peace before the strike by terrorists caused havoc to many households affected by the ugly trend.\n\nNigeria is Being Handed over to Looters, ASUU Cries Out\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has warned that the exclusion of best brains in Nigerian politics through high nomination forms would place the future of the country in the hands of looters.\n\nThe Chairman, University of Ibadan chapter of the union, Prof. Ayoola Akinwole, gave the warning in a June 12 message issued yesterday in Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIt is a strategy of handing over the country to those individuals who have looted the country in the past. If this practice goes unchallenged, Nigerians are in for not just another regime of poor governance but that of extreme corruption and looting.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that it will take a Nigerian Professor who earns N416, 000 per month but saves 20 per cent of his salary over 100 years to be able to purchase the presidential nomination form of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and over 40 years to buy the form of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAkinwole maintained that the 23 years of the return of democracy have been characterised by \u201cleadership of empty promises and dashed hopes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\u2022Okowa tops list of contenders as odds favour South-south\n\n\u2022 APC considers Lawan, Lalong, Bagudu, Buni, Badaru, Amina Mohammed, three others\n\n\u2022Afenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF, PANDEF await decisions of parties on running mates\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nBarring any last-minute changes, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will on Tuesday unveil the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is as the All Progressives Congress (APC) is considering the Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, from Yobe State; Governors Simon Lalong of Plateau State, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State; and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, from Adamawa State, for the position of the running mate to its presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\nAlso being considered by the ruling party are the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Amina Mohammed from Gombe State; former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, also from Borno State. A source privy to the horse-trading told THISDAY that a committee had been set up to carefully examine the chances of each of the candidates and make recommendations to the party.\n\nThe source disclosed that Tinubu has said that he has not thought of it.\n\nFor the PDP, THISDAY gathered that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State tops the list of contenders for Atiku\u2019s running mate as the odds favour the South-south geopolitical zone following concerns that the emergence of a former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi as the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) will swing the South-east votes in favour of LP.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; the pan-Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and their counterparts in the Middle Belt and the Niger Delta \u2013 the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) are awaiting the decisions of the political parties on their choices of running mates before declaring their support.\n\nSome chieftains of the ruling APC have argued that religion should not be a factor in determining the party\u2019s vice-presidential ticket.\n\nThe leadership of the PDP had after the emergence of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the party set up a high-powered committee to drive a rancour-free emergence of his running mate.\n\nThe committee convened several discrete meetings where it met with Atiku and other stakeholders.\n\nA source privy to the meetings told THISDAY that \u201cthe committee has met with all concerned and would unveil its choice Tuesday ahead of the June 17 deadline for the submission of the names of the PDP presidential candidate and his running mate to INEC.\u201d\n\nThe source disclosed that the committee narrowed the search for Atiku\u2019s running mate to the South-south geopolitical zone following the concern that the South-east will vote massively for the Labour Party\u2019s candidate, Obi.\n\nHe explained that under this circumstance, the main opposition party now believes that its strength lies in the South-south as it is also believed that the South-west would be a no-go area for the PDP because of the emergence of the former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the APC.\n\nThe source further disclosed that two governors of the South-south, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and one other unnamed governor are the two major contenders for the PDP vice-presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cThough the leaders of the party believe that the conduct of the unnamed governor is not befitting of a vice presidential candidate, he is being considered because it is believed that he has enormous financial prowess to finance the PDP presidential campaigns. The governor is unfit for the job and that is why Okowa is at the top of the list,\u201d the source added.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the party has mounted pressure on the governor to accept a ministerial position.\n\nIt was also gathered that the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is ruled out because she prefers to remain in her current position.\n\nThe PDP stakeholders are said to be concerned that the emergence of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) would erode APC and PDP votes in the North-west.\n\nThe source said that the APC had won in all the 44 local government areas in Kano State in 2019 with 1.4 million votes, while the PDP got 391,593 votes.\n\n\u201cWith the rising profile of NNPP, the APC may not have votes again as was the case in 2015 and 2019. So, the party is depending on its stakeholders in the North-west to rein in more votes for Atiku in the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the APC is considering the Senate President, Lawan; Governors Lalong, Bagudu, Buni, Badaru; and the Secretary to the SGF, Mustapha, for the position of the running mate to Tinubu.\n\nAlso being considered by the ruling party are the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Ms. Mohammed; former governor of Borno State, Senator Shettima and Imam.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Mohammed is being considered for gender balancing.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF, PANDEF Await Decisions of Parties on Running Mates\n\nIn a related development, the President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu has disclosed that his organisation would meet with Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere and PANDEF after the emergence of the parties\u2019 running mates.\n\nHe said MBF would not be hasty in deciding which political party to support in the 2023 general election, noting that they would study the situation and also watch where the candidates would select their running mates.\n\nPogu, who spoke exclusively to THISDAY, added that there would be alignments and realignments ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said that the MBF consult with Afenifere, PANDEF, and Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo to arrive at a decision on which party or candidate to support.\n\nPohu said, \u201cAPC is not the only party that has elected a southern candidate; there are other political parties with Southern candidates. We will sit down and review the situation after the aspirants have all picked their running mates, we shall then meet with our friends \u2013 Afenifere, PANDEF, and Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, and arrive at a decision.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I am saying is that after the choices of running mates, there may be migrations across party lines, and some changes will begin. I say this because Nigerians cannot be taken for a ride.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the volume of people registering now is unprecedented; it has never happened this way before. It shows that Nigerians are up for something.\u201d\n\nReligion Should Not Be a Factor, Say APC Chieftains\n\nMeanwhile, some chieftains of the ruling APC have argued that religion should not be a factor in the consideration of the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN); former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Babachir Lawal and other stakeholders had kicked against the Muslim-Muslim ticket, insisting that ethnoreligious factors are still very much relevant in Nigerian politics. But the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai believed that competence should be a major consideration and not religion.\n\nA National Vice Chairman of the party, Dr Salihu Lukman, in a statement issued yesterday said kicking against the Muslim-Muslim ticket was a backward national mindset, which must be changed.\n\nHe said as important as ethnic and religious identities are, addressing challenges facing the country requires that political leaders are not allowed to ride on cheap sentiments of religion and ethnicity to opportunistically win elections.\n\n\u201cIf choices of leaders are dictated by ethnoreligious factors, Nigerian politics will continue to be disadvantageous to many sections of the country. For instance, only Christian Southerners and Muslim Northerners will continue to have advantages.\n\nThe Deputy National Organising Secretary of the party, Hon. Nze Duru told THISDAY that consultations were still ongoing in the party regarding the issue of the running mate.\n\nHe added that it remains the prerogative of the candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu to choose a running mate that would complement his strength.\n\n\u201cWhat is important for Nigeria today is good governance, creating the level-playing field; giving hope to the people of this country,\u201d Duru explained.\n\nOn his part, former National Vice Chairman of APC, South-south, Hilliard Etta, said he did not predicate his politics on religion or ethnic consideration.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf my politics was considered on ethnic considerations. I would have worked and voted for (Rotimi) Amaechi. He\u2019s from my zone; I don\u2019t care about those kinds of things. Those are the things that have held Nigeria down,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, the former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Yekini Nabena, stated that the important factor is the personality involved and not his religion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*\u2018It\u2019s a threat to fragile peace, unity of Nigeria\u2019\n\n*Babachir: Nigerians conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics\n\n*El-rufai: Competence vital for running mate, not religion\n\n*Osinbajo promises to support Tinubu\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Northern Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) yesterday expressed opposition to alleged moves by the presidential candidates of Nigeria\u2019s two leading political party to present Muslim running mates for the 2023 presidential election, cautioning that Christians will reject any political party that fails to heed its warning.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Atiku Abubakar, a Muslim holds the presidential flag of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) while Bola Tinubu, also a Muslim picked that of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last Wednesday. The two are now searching for running mates.\n\n\n\nCAN and NOSCEF\u2019s caveats are coming on the heels of a similar one by the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, to the APC against a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, saying Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nBut Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State stressed yesterday that competence should determine his party\u2019s choice of presidential running mate instead of religion.\n\nOn the same day, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared his readiness to give total support to Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nCAN, in the statement signed by its National Secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola warned the two leading political parties to bury the thought of Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe want to unequivocally state that it is a threat to the fragile peace and unity of Nigeria,\u201d said CAN.\n\nIt urged all political parties to ensure that the balance of both religious practitioners is considered in the choice of running mates for the presidential candidates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do not subscribe to Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. Politicians can talk politics but we have stated our view long before now. Any party that tries same religion ticket will fail.\n\n\u201cThis is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christian ticket, the church still goes through hell. Only God knows the number of Christians that have been killed in the last seven years with no one apprehended or prosecuted.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power? The extant Nigerian Constitution promotes religious balance. So, if any political party wants to try Muslim/Muslim ticket, it\u2019s at its own peril. CAN is only forewarning, but will make a categorical statement in the event our warning is not heeded.\n\n\n\nCAN said, \u201cthe Presidential running mate of APC presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu should be a Christian from the North, Atiku\u2019s running mate should be a Christian from the South while Obi should choose his own among the Muslims from the North\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnything contrary to the above means that the leadership of these political parties do not bother about the unity of this entity called Nigeria. Those who are planning Muslim/Muslim ticket should also find out what was the outcome of MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket in 1993. If they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time around, the outcome will be worse because our fault lines are very visible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no party that has no great, good and patriotic Christians who can preside over the affairs of this nation not to talk of being the Vice President as some mischievous people are trying to say. If merit and competence are used as yardsticks, we have many qualified Christians in all the 774 Local Government Areas of this country,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nCAN said its leadership had tried in vain to get President Muhammadu Buhari to break the monopoly or dominance of the security architecture with people of same faith.\n\n\u201cWe are all seeing the outcome now. It is obvious that the Nigeria of today is different from that of 1993. Our politicians should stop flouting the Constitution by respecting the North and South dichotomy and religious factor. To those arguing that people do not care about the religions of their leaders once they are competent and credible, we dare APC to pick its Presidential running mate from the South and PDP pick its own from the North and see what follows.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the late sage, Papa Obafemi Awolowo picked Chief Mrs Oyibo Odinamadu, a fellow Christian and Southerner, as his runningmate in 1979, we all know the consequences of his performance in the North. Our politicians should be doing what will unite us instead of what will further polarise the country,\u201d it said.\n\nNorthern Christian Elders Oppose Muslim VP\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders Forum also sounded a note of warning that the country\u2019s diversity should be taken into consideration by Tinubu and Atiku while choosing their running mates.\n\nNOSCEF in its Democracy Day message to the nation, signed by its President, Ejoga Inalegwu, cautioned that Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets would be insensitive.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to all patriotic presidential candidates to avoid manipulative but dangerous and insensitive tickets that will further polarize the nation along religious lines when Nigerians are looking forward, with great expectations for a new dawn, come 2023; a new era and government devoid of politics of exclusion, discrimination and injustice.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the parties therefore, make efforts to meet the deadline for the submission of their presidential and vice-presidential candidates, NOSCEF wants to again appeal to political parties to be sensitive to the mood of the nation, the religious diversity of our people and show patriotism by avoiding any action that will throw up our lines of divide, merely to win elections rather than steps that will unite our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to believe that anyone with the credentials to rule this nation from 2023, should be sensitive enough and not be a candidate that would take us back to our religious divides, through the instrument of Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. We do not expect any patriot to, by so doing, again open the wounds for our past bitter religious divides.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need, as a nation, a united front to forge a new Nigeria, that will bring people together across religious divides because we do not lack quality across the religious and regional divides,\u201d it insisted.\n\nThe frontline group said that politicians should make deliberate efforts at avoiding playing the religious cards through such tickets and not turn around to accuse those who condemn their unpatriotic action as the culprits.\n\nBabachir: Muslim-Muslim Ticket Dead on Arrival\n\nA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has warned the APC against allowing a Muslim as running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, who is also a Muslim.\n\nLawal, who spoke on a television programme on Thursday pointed out that Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Tinubu would have been running mate to the President Muhammadu Buhari, when the latter became the candidate of the APC in 2014 but for the discouragement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThere are concerns that Tinubu, a Muslim, might be forced to pick a Muslim running mate from the North for political prpose.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if it was time for northern Christians allegedly marginalised to be placated with the nomination of one of them as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, Lawal said, \u201cI will answer this question in a roundabout way. A political party is in the business of winning elections and to win elections you need to get the votes to beat your opponents. The way I see it is that in choosing your vice-president; that must be paramount in your mind. You can have the best ticket but if you don\u2019t win elections, it is a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, whatever candidate we are going to choose, we will bear in mind that that vice-president will contribute to winning that election. How does he (or she) continue? It is either he (or she) is popular and can bring in the votes or he (or she) can bring the money that will help our logistics in getting out the votes, so we can win the elections.\n\n\u201cBut then, there is also the requirement that you want to run a united country; you want to run a country where you don\u2019t he friction in the society \u2013 peaceful, settled and everybody goes about their business.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, you must factor in Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities in politics. That is why, for example, in recognition of these peculiarities, the northern governors and the majority of us in the North felt that the presidency ought to shift to the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a requirement in the Constitution that it has to shift. There is no zoning. But it is so we can have a country that is united; that everybody can go about their business in a peaceful environment.\n\n\u201cIt could have been possible for a northern (presidential) candidate to emerge. But then, you would know that running the country in that manner would have the southern part of Nigeria (to be) hostile to that government. So, we allowed it to shift.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, extending that consideration to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have lived among the Christians and I know that among the Christians, the question of a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-go area. It is dead on arrival. Buhari himself, even at that time, had to drop this present presidential candidate (Tinubu) because of the tension of a Muslim-Muslim ticket. And we have not seen anything in the country that has changed significantly to allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it has worsened. The religious divide has increased. Tribal divisions have increased. Regional divisions have increased. So, it would be a good thing if APC would settle for a Muslim-Christian ticket because we know (that the) PDP, that is what they would do.\u201d\n\nEl-rufai: Competence Vital, Not Religion\n\nEl-rufai, who was asked to react to the clamour for Christians as running mates of the leading presidential candidates for 2023, declared that competence should be vital in the selection, not religion.\n\nThe Kaduna governor, who spoke on a television programme declared: \u201cYou are asking the wrong person because I don\u2019t look at people from the lens of Muslim Muslim or Christian Christian. Most of my friends are Christians.\n\nIt was Tunde Bakare, a Pentecostal pastor that invited me to CPC, not President Buhari. I don\u2019t think the business of governance has to do with religion, I think we should look for the best person for the job, let\u2019s look for competence, capacity. I am the wrong person to ask because in my state I looked and chose my deputy as a Christian woman. This fixation of Nigerians with religion is worrying.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo: I Will Support Tinubu to Win in 2023\n\nOsinbajo yesterday declared his readiness to give total support Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe also emphasized that he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nThe Vice President, who spoke in Abuja at the campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidential race, pledged his personal support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President, who came a distant third in the party\u2019s presidential primary on Wednesday, recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu Thursday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Vice President described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\u201d\n\n\n\nOshiomhole: Tinubu\u2019s Victory a Reaffirmation of His Capacity\n\nA former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole has described the victory of Tinubu as a reaffirmation of his much-acclaimed unique capacity.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole in a statement issued yesterday said the Presidential candidate of APC represents a movement.\n\nHe noted that he had no doubt that Nigerians, no matter their political persuasions, would readily recognize his unique abilities and accept him as the right person needed at this momentous time, to lead this nation and transcend all extant challenges.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole said: \u201cThis victory is a reaffirmation of your much-acclaimed unique capacity to headhunt, mobilize, motivate and empower the best minds, irrespective of their tribe or religion, and use their combined creative efforts to translate your vision into reality.\n\n\u201cThis is a key asset of leadership that you possess, which over the years has differentiated you from others and positioned you well above your contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou represent a movement, a force, full of energy and radiating hope of a brighter future to come, when Nigerians hand over to you the baton of leadership, which you are well prepared for and ready to accept with all its attendant responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSouth-West APC Congratulates Tinubu, Promises 90% of Region\u2019s Votes\n\nThe APC in the South-West under the chairmanship of Isaac Kekemeke has congratulated Tinubu on his election as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nThe South-West APC in a statement yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Ayo Afolabi, said Tinubu\u2019s victory was a proof of his popularity and acceptability all over the country.\n\nThe party said it believed Tinubu\u2019s emergence would translate to victory at the poll and it would bring about the massive turnaround needed by the country.\n\nThe party also assured Tinubu of its resolve to deliver 90 per cent of the region\u2019s votes during the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cWithout doubt, your election demonstrated an overwhelming support from Nigerians across the geo-political zones which was a clear indication that Nigerians want you as their next president.\n\n\u201cThe APC in the South-West stands by you in every step you take in the journey to the Presidency, and we like to assure you that we will deliver the votes of the South-West in not less than 90 per cent of total registered voters in the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are one with our governors, National Assembly members, State Assembly members, local governments and indeed all leaders and members of our great party within the South-West region at this movement.\n\n\u201cWe send you our hearty congratulations, and we pray that this will be the beginning of a turnaround for Nigeria in terms of security, economic development, infrastructural upgrading, agric development and housing for the entire population of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all Nigerians to stand up and be counted in this noble movement to build on the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari which will put Nigeria in its proper place in the comity of great nations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We are growing,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe social contract between the government and the people with the ballot as arbiter is daily being strengthened. The combined effort of government, the people and civil society across the federation are bringing us closer to our highest democratic ideals and aspirations.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a day for gratitude and hope \u2014 a day to remind ourselves that what was once thought impossible of Nigeria has been proven possible, and that what is yet considered so, is well within our grasps. We only have to keep moving forward, each one of us playing our part.\n\n\u201cIt is possible for light to overcome darkness; it is possible for joy to overcome sorrow; it is possible for peace to prevail over terror; it is possible for us to be united, irrespective of our cultural, linguistic, religious or even ideological differences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJesus said to the crowd in Luke 12:54: \u2018When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, \u2018it\u2019s going to rain,\u2019 and it does.\u2019 We have seen the rain coming over Nigeria. A rain of peace and prosperity \u2014 one which like the goodness of God, touches everyone no matter who or where they are.\n\n\u201cToday, let us rest assured in the promise and possibilities of Nigeria. We have the talent, and the resources to be a beacon of hope and standard-bearer for the rest of Africa and the black race.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo added that he believes in the possibilities that Nigeria can achieve, adding that the country will overcome its challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have been progressively proving that we have what it takes to run an open, honest and transparent government that guarantees the rule of law and secures every corner of the nation; that in this decade, we can lift 100 million people out of poverty and guarantee equal access to education and opportunities for our women, bringing to fruition the most comprehensive social welfare programme for the poor and vulnerable on this side of the planet,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know the challenges. We live with them.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s controversial \u201cICT Practitioners Bill\u201d is closer to becoming law",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Kenya\u2019s 12th parliament passed the controversial 2020 proposal that seeks to regulate \u201canyone who employs technologies to collect, process, store or transfer information for a fee\u201d.\n\nFirst introduced in 2016 by majority leader, Aden Duale, and supported by Kenyan MP, Godfrey Osotsi, the wide-sweeping and vague ICT Practitioners Bill mandated the registration and licensing of vaguely defined \u201cICT practitioners\u201d by a council. According to the 2016 proposal, individuals who sought registration with the council needed to have completed a university education with at least 3 years of relevant experience and would pay an annual license fee. The proposal also outlined jail terms and fines for individuals who failed to comply.\n\nA snapshot of the amended 2020 bill. The full bill is here.\n\nNeedless to say, the proposal drew an outcry from the country\u2019s tech community and was reportedly withdrawn after Joseph Mucheru, Cabinet Secretary in Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Information and Computer Technology, rejected it, noting that proposals in the bill would affect innovative talent and alienate local youth from lucrative online jobs, educational and investment opportunities. At the time, Mucheru had said, \u201cIf enacted, the ICT Protection Bill 2016 will cause duplication in regulation and frustrate individual talents from realising their potential.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2016.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, a member of parliament who was nominated to represent workers, Godfrey Osotsi, reintroduced the bill with an amendment that simply loosened the eligibility requirement for ICT professionals. Now instead of being required to have graduated from a university, a proposed ICT Practitioners Council would determine who got registered.\n\nIn 2018, the bill was also rejected.\n\nAgain, 2 years later in November 2020, the bill was reintroduced with superficial amendments that removed degree requirements, jail terms, and fines for people who fail to register.\n\nAlmost 2 years later, this Wednesday in a sleepy parliamentary session, and with one day to go before the 12th parliament closed shop for the term, the bill was quietly passed and now awaits presidential assent.\n\nWho is supporting this bill?\n\nWhile the bill has generated outrage from stakeholders in Kenya\u2019s tech community, there is significant support from a raft of tech professionals. In 2016, the Secretary-General of the ICT Association of Kenya (ICTAK), Kamotho Njenga, released a statement supporting the bill. \u201cOnce enacted,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201cthe various provisions enlisted will go a long way not only to elevate the standards of ICT practice in Kenya but to also avail a blueprint that will help counter multiple challenges that accompany emergent technologies. By creating a registration framework, the bill injects professionalism and introduces a culture of accountability within the industry as the country gears towards an ICT-driven economy.\u201d\n\nPaul Macharia, a health informatics consultant supports the proposal. \u201cHaving worked in the ICT space for over 15 years, I know we needed a regulatory body like yesterday.\u201d he opined. He says the bill will ensure standards of competence, allow governments to keep a register of all the professionals that meet these standards and deal with the professionals that fall short of these standards.\n\nBoth Macharia and the ICTAK\u2019s points are the standard arguments of the proponents of the bill. But Kenya already has a Computer Misuse Act and a Cyber Crimes Act\u2014both wide-sweeping laws that regulate the use of technology in Kenya, so it is not clear how or why another law is needed to stop the so-called quacks from operating. Besides this, the bill does not disclose how the council would issue accreditation for ICT professionals or provide the criteria to be used in determining if an individual is of good moral standing.\n\nThat \u201cquack\u201d classification is also problematic. Information technology is one of the most dynamic and fast-growing spaces globally. Unlike civil engineering or medical health, for example, a software developer does not need to be certified to build software. Indeed many of today\u2019s widely used tech products are built and maintained by unlicensed developers. No country has the sort of national ICT licensing programme that this bill proposes.\n\nBut Macharia contends that Kenya can lead the way, \u201cSure! Kenya being the first is a great thing,\u201d he wrote in a LinkedIn comment. \u201cWe could set the pace/standard on how ICT professionals work.\u201d\n\nA black spot for Silicon Savannah\n\nKenya\u2019s Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 depends on strong performance from its burgeoning ICT sector. Photo by Mustafa Omar on Unsplash\n\nA loose alignment of tech stakeholders and professionals who have been fighting the bill since its debut in 2016 disagree.\n\nIn a draft counter-statement to the ICTAK\u2019s 2016 declaration seen by this writer, the group wrote, \u201cRegistering of practitioners does not necessarily lead to professionalism and accountability. ICTAK has not cited any direct evidence that registering of practitioners affects the overall quality of services provided to customers by members of a regulated profession.\u201d\n\nThe statement continues, \u201cAlmost every ICT job is conducted within the confines of \u201ccontracts\u201d that define the responsibilities of parties involved, hence ensuring accountability. What values shall this bill add to the accountability of ICT practitioners, that is beyond the scope of contracts we sign today as we go about our duties?\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d\u2026 gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem.\n\nMembers of the group also organised a petition which garnered over 14,000 votes at the time and succeeded in getting the bill withdrawn twice. But the almost comical and steady 2-year-gap-march of the bill appears to have won out\u2014at least in parliament.\n\nStakeholders now fear a presidential assent on the bill could seal what has been described as rent-seeking behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I think the bill is detrimental is that innovation is about thinking outside the box,\u201d Sheena Raikundalia, Director of UK-Kenya Tech Hub told TechCabal, \u201cit\u2019s not about your degree or paper certificates. Some of the best techies I know are self-taught! Tech moves so fast, [that] by the time you finish your degree what you learnt is outdated. This is taking a step back.\u201d\n\nAffectionately described as Africa\u2019s Silicon Savannah, Kenya is one of the Big Four technology heavyweights in Africa. As recently as last month, Microsoft and Google set up new offices in Nairobi, global card payment association, Visa announced that it had opened an innovation hub\u2014one of only 6 in the world, and Amazon announced plans to open an Amazon Web Services (AWS) local zone in the country. These are all a significant testament to the East African nation\u2019s tech reputation which also ranks 4th on the list of African countries with the most professional developers only behind Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt.\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d. But in a heating tech talent market, poorly thought out regulation that looks, to all intents, like pure gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem. Right now Kenya is distracted by its upcoming national elections, and reports of social media-fueled hate speech and misinformation are increasing. Those are important areas for regulation; deciding who is qualified to build a mobile app is not.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Tijan Watt is building a pan-African VC from Dakar",
          "text": "On a windy Thursday evening, in April, a delegation of investors, startup founders, and journalists gathered at the Port of Dakar waiting for the Chaloupe de Gor\u00e9e, a formidable ferry that could hold as many as 340 people, to transport them to the historic Gor\u00e9e Island, where Wuri Ventures, a Dakar-based pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, was hosting its launch party.\n\nAway from the high-end restaurants and 5-star hotels\u2019 seaside bars in Dakar\u2019s city centre where most other events of this nature took place, 45-year-old Tijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Venture, had spefically chosen this Gor\u00e9e Island, which used to be the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d during the Transatlantic Slave Trade, to introduce his firm to the world.\n\nWatt towered over almost everybody else on the chaloupe in a white, Guinea-fabric shirt and black jeans. Even though his beard had nearly gone a solid grey, he was still full of energy, and his eyes were as ambitious as they probably were 21 years ago when he first moved back to Senegal.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWuri Venture is not a new establishment; it\u2019s more than 3 years old. It was first conceptualised through an early advisory business called African Tech Leaders that Watt had founded to advise startups in the process of fundraising and seeking entry into global accelerators like Y Combinator. But Watt told TechCabal that in 2018, he realised advisory alone wasn\u2019t enough to scale the ecosystem, and the idea to start investing in early-stage startups was born. He joined forces with Jerome Cretegny, a seasoned investment professional leading the Senegalese operation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the time. The two combined their personal funds and used that to back promising African founders. In 2019, they incorporated Wuri Ventures, and within a year, the duo made 6 investments.\n\nWatt said that to realise their pan-African ambition, they needed more funds. So they sold 7.5% equity from their general partner equity, bringing 15 top tech and finance operators into the venture. They also partnered with Capria Ventures, which provided Wuri with the credit line it needed to invest, and eventually led to a $1.5 million investment in South Africa\u2019s Whereismytransport $14.5 million series A extension round before the partnership was discontinued. After that, the firm launched a subscription model so that they could pool funds from local and international individual investors\u2014angels, endowment funds, family offices, etc.\u2014using the Angellist Venture platform (It\u2019s the same platform Nigeria\u2019s Future Africa and Kenya\u2019s Mutua Venture use to power their subscription angel investing models.)\n\nA delegation of investors, startup founders, tech operators and journalists admiring and taking pictures of the historical Gor\u00e9e island as the chaloupe approaches the island.\n\nHowever in January this year, Carry1st, a mobile game publishing company Wuri Venture invested in at a very early stage and at a $4 million valuation, closed a $20 million series A extension round from a16z and Google at a valuation of $100 million. This single deal returned double of all the 6 deals they had made over the years. So Wuri exited so that it could be liquid enough to fund other deals.\n\n\u201cWe made some good returns and exited so that we can continue supporting other early stage startups,\u201d Watt told TechCabal.\n\nEven prior to the official launch in April, Wuri Ventures has advised more than 20 startups and invested $2 million across 14 deals including Carry1st, Whereismytransport, Lori Systems, Kotani Pay, Tambua Health, Norebase, Nestocoin and Caytu Robotics amongst others. The firm continues to invest alongside global investment leaders such as a16z, Google, Toyota Tshusho, Avenir Growth and others. Now, Watt believes that its subscription model is going to help ramp up their investment figure from $2 million to $4 million within a year.\n\nWuri Venture also provides incubating programs for founders to learn the ropes of the startup world. Caytu Robotics, one of such startups that incubated with Wuri, recently displayed one of its robots, an Autonomous Delivery Robot, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where it was remotely controlled from Dakar\u20146,000 km away from Boston where MIT is located.\n\nFrom Wall Street to selling sugar in Dakar\n\nWatt was born to a Senegalese father and an African American mother. He grew up in Washington, DC where he attended Sidwell Friends School, a prestigious institution that counts Chelsea Clinton and Sasha and Malia Obama among its esteemed alumni. Watt went on to study mathematics and computer science at Howard University, a historically black college.\n\nAfter a brief foray into science, running lab tests on both humans and animals, Watt spent 3 years as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in New York and London, and in 2001 he decided to move to Senegal.\n\nEven though the dotcom boom had shown signs of bursting in 2000, it didn\u2019t, and the cool kids of Wall Street were still dumping their six-figure salaries to embrace the promise of the digital revolution. Even though Watt saw his colleagues moving to companies like Priceline, he devised a plan instead to move to Africa and become a dotcom pioneer there. How difficult could that be?\n\nTijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Ventures, stands on a makeshift podium to address the guests at the launch event.\n\nIn reality, Watt had only visited Senegal once when he was 18 and knew close to nothing about the landscape. He started to abandon one startup idea after the other: he first wanted to become an internet service provider (ISP) but the \u201cexisting player had a massive capital warchest to kill him on arrival,\u201d he giggled as he narrated this part. After spending a year playing with ideas, he started his own flavoured sugar company in 2002. The company was called Crystal, a name he claimed was inspired by a Notorious BIG song\u2014and that\u2019s how he waltzed off the track of his dotcom ambition.\n\nLike his earlier ISP idea, the Senegalese sugar industry was dominated by The Mimran Group, a French, family-owned company. The Mimran Group owns the Compagnie Sucri\u00e8re S\u00e9n\u00e9galaise (CSS) which cultivates 8,000 hectares of sugarcane in Senegal, and has more than 5,000 employees during harvest time\u2014the largest employer in Senegal after the country\u2019s government. To understand how much money this family made from sugar consumption in Senegal as far back as the 1980s, in 1981, they paid $3 million to acquire Lamborghini and saved the Italian fast car company from bankruptcy. Then they sold it to Chrysler Corporation in 1987 after expanding its model line of product from 1 to 3 in the space of 6 years.\n\n\u201cMy thought then was: since everyone in the country consumes sugar, it\u2019s essentially like a tax on the population,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd then that should not be held in the hands of a single person or that single family.\u201d So at 26, the ambitious Watt took on the Mimran empire.\n\nWatt would build the business into a household name employing nearly 100 people and achieving revenues of $15 million. In the grand scheme of things, that didn\u2019t harm the Mimran\u2019s dominance, but Watt believes that it created a new narrative. \u201cThere is a lot of value in Africa and it\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s the foreigners who are capturing most of it. To some extent, we changed that\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years running the company as CEO, building processes and structure, Watt left to pursue an MBA at Harvard. After that, he worked as an investment officer at Nigeria\u2019s Travant Capital in Lagos, where he stayed for 2 years before returning to Senegal to run Crystal in 2009. Seven years after, Watt finally exited Crystal and moved to Ethiopia to work as the chief revenue officer of mFino, a fintech company providing banks and telcos with mobile banking solutions in major markets in Africa including Ethiopia, Nigeria and Senegal. He stayed at mFino for a little over a year before moving to Silicon Valley in 2017 to start African Tech Leaders, an advisory firm that would morph into Wuri Venture.\n\nSacha Haider, Partner at Global Ventures, and other guests listening to Watt\u2019s speech at the launch event.\n\nThe same hunger still lingers in Watt\u2019s eyes as the ferry approaches the island, prompting guests to pull out their phones and take pictures as they make their way to the Keur Louise, a colonial house dating back to 1864, where the event would happen.\n\nAs the guests, now gathered in the beautiful stone lined courtyard of the historical house, enjoyed a variety of hors d\u2019oeuvres, an artist, sitting in a corner holding his Kora instrument dearly to his chest, blessed the scene with a calming rendition. After the meal, the guest mingled and conversed for a bit. The music stopped and Watt signalled he was making a speech from a makeshift podium. Watt told the abridged version of his entrepreneurial journey, and attempted to sell the crowd on Wuri Venture\u2019s dream, especially its subscription plan, urging them to join Wuri Ventures in building a prosperous Africa one startup at a time.\n\n\u201cWe support the concept of entrepreneurism, which is the notion that through proactive initiative, founders can create positive change in their own societies and can create their own economic opportunities,\u201d Watt said. \u201cThe subscription fund further pushes that vision by empowering individual investors.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Where to invest N1m right now",
          "text": "For most people, saving N1 a day isn\u2019t enough by itself to make them rich. But the fact that you can end up with tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands or millions of naira, from a N1-per-day investment just shows the power of small, consistent effort.\n\n\u201cThe first rule of an investment is don\u2019t lose (money). And the second rule of an investment is don\u2019t forget the first rule,\u201d Warren Buffett once said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s business environment is being plagued by FX liquidity concerns, insecurity, policy flip-flop, weaker consumer pockets, and lack of infrastructure, which are discouraging long-term capital commitments.\n\nBroadly, there are three major investible instruments: equity, money market, and fixed income securities.\n\nBefore you invest in stocks, bonds, Treasury bills (T-Bills), exchange traded funds, foreign exchange, and even cryptocurrency, you must consider your investment objective, risk tolerance and source of fund, and age.\n\nLizzie Kings-Wali, chief executive officer of Blackstone Capital Limited, said: \u201cEquity market is likely to have a bumpy ride throughout the election cycle, especially as yields on fixed income rise and Naira gets more volatile.\n\n\u201cYou may have noticed the steady uptick in yield in the fixed income environment, including primary market, where even the yield on the FGN Saving Bonds has steadily climbed above 9 percent for the three-year note.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, Eurobonds funds are a good option for those who seek to hedge FX risk of naira volatility and seek exposure to a rising yield environment.\n\n\u201cAlbeit, for those who do not mind taking the risk of the equity market, I would suggest they target to buy when it gets lower, especially value counters in the banking sector, which I think should see the most volatility and portends the highest upside, as the banks (especially Tier-1 names) should benefit from the naira depreciation and rising rate environment,\u201d Kings-Wali said.\n\nYinka Abenuwagun, an investment analyst at Value Alliance Asset Management, said: \u201cInvesting is not straightforward for everyone because every portfolio is created based on the risk appetite of the investor.\n\n\u201cFor someone with a high-risk appetite, 25-50 percent of the N1million can go to equity, 20 percent to the money market (commercial papers, treasury bills) and 30 percent to bonds (example; corporate bonds).\u201d\n\nHe advised low-risk appetite investors to put 10 percent in equity, 85 percent into fixed income as they are the most stable and 5 percent in bonds.\n\nAbenuwagun said: \u201cFor medium-risk investors \u2013 they are people willing to take a bit of risk but not as much as those with high risk, 30 percent of the capital can go to equities, 30 percent to bonds and 40 percent to money market (20 percent a high yield fixed deposit and 20 percent to commercial papers).\n\n\u201cMarket is a cycle that goes up and turns down; we are at the point where the market might turn downwards as we are approaching election period. FX issues and macro issues will have a negative impact on the equity market for the rest of the year; so entering now might be a bad time for a low-risk investor.\n\n\u201cReal estate is a highly volatile sector because of the uncertainty that comes with real estate, but there are different investments that come with real estate such as Real Estate Investment Trust Fund. The capital is not enough to buy a property as it requires huge capital.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sola Oni, a chartered securities dealer, there are warning signals that every investor must watch out for in order to avert avoidable risk.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis explains why some investors smile to their banks often, irrespective of the mood of the market, while others go on endless fasting and prayers for losing money daily.\n\n\u201cIt is settled in financial management that there is no investment without risk elements. Government bonds, called gilt edge and crowned as risk-free, are merely theoretical. Although the risk level is significantly low, compared with ordinary shares, that does not remove risks entirely.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oni, a government bond, with all its benefits, is subject to inflation risk, interest rate risk and opportunity cost risk, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut risks are more pronounced in corporate bonds, of which the biggest are default and liquidity risks. While default risk refers to the possibility that the company may not be able to redeem the bond\u2019s principal at maturity, liquidity risk is a lack of demand for the bond when the bondholder is willing to sell.\n\n\u201cThere are key issues that every investor must monitor, prior to purchase or sale of shares. They are usually referred to as red flags. Every investment decision is impacted by red flags and failure to watch out for them may turn a profitable investment to mere gambling.\u201d\n\nOni said a company\u2019s management should be examined before investing in such an organisation.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor instance, an investment game-changer of all times, Warren Buffett, will never purchase shares of a company whose management lacks integrity, skills and competencies.\n\n\u201cBefore an investor buys into shares of a company, he must study the trend of earnings. Shrinking profit margins and decelerating sales growth are signals that the company\u2019s business model is probably failing. The share price of such a company is vulnerable to volatility. Let me quickly add that volatility is part of every stock market. But understanding how to play around it separates men from boys in the art and science of investments.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee recently raised the Monetary Policy Rate by 150 basis points to 13 percent, in line with the hawkish policy stance being adopted by policy authorities in both developed and emerging markets to combat inflation and increase the attractiveness of local securities. Nigeria\u2019s April inflation rate printed higher at 16.82 percent, compared to 15.92 percent in March.\n\nRead also: Need to leverage investment in real estate today\n\nIn the Nigerian equities market, bearish sentiment prevailed in the week ended June 3 as the All-Share Index declined by 2.18 percent week-on-week to 52,908.24points; while the year-to-date return decreased to +23.86 percent. On a sectoral basis, the sentiment was broadly negative as all indices, except NGX Insurance recorded week-on-week loss. Also, the sentiment in the fixed income secondary market was mixed, as average T-bills yield increased by 11 basis points to 4.69 percent, while bond yields declined by 6bps to 11.16percent.\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP grew by 3.1percent year-on-year in first-quarter of 2022, compared with 3.9 percent in fourth-quarter 2021.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, the Central Bank of Nigeria expects steady GDP growth but at a subdued pace, due to headwinds associated with unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy. These headwinds include the effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis as well as persisting supply chain disruptions in major trading routes. Furthermore, China is confronted with the spread of COVID-19, and its zero-COVID policy is leading to the total lockdown of manufacturing hubs/cities,\u201d Chinwe Egwim, chief economist at Lagos-based Coronation Merchant Bank said in a recent economic note.\n\n\u201cWe expect the hawkish tone to cause significant disruptions across all asset classes. We see scope for a surge in money market and bond yields in the coming months. In addition, we expect a negative reaction in the equities market as investors sell off equity exposures in response to rising yields. However, we expect companies with solid half-year (H1) 2022 earnings performance will remain attractive to investors particularly in July,\u201d said United Capital research analysts in their May 25 note.\n\nThe United Capital analysts said last week that despite the rate hike by the MPC, \u201cwhich ideally makes the fixed income space more attractive to both local and foreign investors, Nigeria\u2019s extended FX crunch continues to deter foreign investors\u2019 interest in the Nigerian capital market, raising concerns for foreign portfolio investment inflows.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, risks associated with the political environment in anticipation of the general 2023 elections outweigh the benefits of the rate hike,\u201d they added.",

          "text": "With the presidential primaries of the parties over and the emergence of their candidates, it is now obvious that about sixteen political parties are set to do battle at the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nThe parties in the race are African Action Congress (AAC), African Democratic Congress (ADC), Action Democratic Party (ADP), Accord Party (AP), All Progressives Congress (APC), All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Boot Party (BP), and Labour Party (LP).\n\nOthers are New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), National Rescue Mission (NRM), People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), People\u2019s Redemption Party (PRP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), Young Progressives Party (YPP), Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), and Action Alliance (AA).\n\nFrom the pack, about four parties are seen to be prominent and actually in the race, either because of the popularity and structure of the platforms, or the popularity of the candidates flying the flags of such parties.\n\nIt was against this perception that while the primary elections and selection process of most of the parties went unnoticed, those of the APC, PDP attracted the attention of the entire country and the outside world.\n\nAlthough the presidential primaries of the Labour Party and the New Nigeria People Party did not attract huge publicity, their candidates are considered formidable and are capable of springing surprises in the election.\n\nAcross the country, in recent weeks, especially on social media the presidential primaries have attracted a wide following among Nigerians, especially among the youth population.\n\nIn the last few days, Nigerians and political leaders have expressed divergent views on the candidates and what they bring to the table.\n\nObservers are of the view that judging from their political antecedents and background, the presidential contest would be a four horse race between Atiku, Tinubu, Obi and Kwankwaso.\n\nUntil the elections are over, the names of the foremost candidates of the four leading parties will continue to be on the lips of Nigerians. As they begin their campaigns, they will cause a lot of disruptions in social and economic lives of the country.\n\nUnlike in 2019 when the contest was only between President Muhammadu Buhari, who was then seeking a second term in office and Atiku, pundits predict that the scenarios would be different this time around.\n\nKwankwaso and his party is tipped to give the other candidates a tough challenge in the North West, and even the entire Northern Nigeria, where he had already teamed up with another former governor of his home state, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau.\n\nBut unlike in 2015 and 2019 elections when APC dominated the zone due largely to the towering presence of outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari, who hails from the region, next year\u2019s presidential election would be keenly contested by the APC, PDP, NNPP and Labour Party.\n\nIt is believed that since incumbent cult following wouldn\u2019t be a factor anymore and considering the state of the country which may not work in favour of the ruling party, there could be surprises.\n\nThere is no doubt that each of the aspirants would have a strong showing in their zones, just like Tinubu would win the South West, Obi is expected to win the South East, but their success elsewhere would largely determine how far they would go which would also be determined by several factors.\n\n\u201cTinubu would win his South West base; Atiku, who hails from Adamawa State in the North East would also carry the day there. Obi should win in the South East. Kwankwaso would also make a strong showing in the North West.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think, the South-South and the North Central zones are the battleground regions for Tinubu, Atiku and Obi, their fates in the presidential election would be determined by their strong outing or otherwise there.\n\n\u201cMy worry for Obi is that he does not have the structure across the country with LP, and the time is not with him,\u201d Tope Musowo, political analyst, said.\n\nObservers also say that given the situation of things in the country at the moment, nothing is sacrosanct in terms of which party will carry the day.\n\nTaking a critical look at the chances of the candidates, Emeka Emordi, a Delta State-born politician and business mogul, noted that the 2023 election may likely throw in surprises as both candidates of the two major parties have huge setback despite their acclaimed popularity.\n\n\u201cThe South East has been the stronghold of PDP, but the party\u2019s failure to zone its ticket to the zone may work against them and the southern part of the country will likely not vote for PDP because it means returning the north and Fulani for another eight years,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the chances of APC, the politician disclosed that Nigerians have suffered the most under APC, amid divisions and that the votes, if they truly count, may not roll in favour of the APC.\n\n\u201cYes, Bola Tinubu is popular in South West, but many have not forgiven him for selling the Buhari dummy to them. They are waiting for 2023 for payback, even many of his Yoruba kinsmen may not cast their vote for him, and that is why I think the Vice President lost the ticket. He is part of this administration and cannot absolve himself of any blame because he could have resigned if he was not happy with the situation in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso analyzing the issue, Chijioke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker, noted that Kwankwaso has a cult followership in the North West and that it could puncture PDP\u2019s chances, as Kano will vote for its own.\n\nFor him, the fans of Kwankwaso are not the type you will buy unless the NNPP presidential candidate urges them to vote for Atiku.\n\n\u201cI think the Labour Party and NNPP will pull surprises because Nigerians are tired of APC, PDP and their candidates, who have always expressed desperation to rule. For Obi, I think many are rallying for him and I think he represents the change Nigeria needs now because the two major flag bearers have been and are still part of the problems of the country today,\u201d he explained.\n\nMoreover, Umelahi does not think that Labour Party is a weak platform. According to him, it is personality and performance that people will vote for in 2023 and not party.\n\nThe former Abia PDP member lamented that the South East has been the stronghold of PDP and not zoning the ticket to the South East for 2023 means denial of an opportunity to realise that ambition and that it may work against PDP in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo delegates at the PDP primaries were alleged to have voted for Atiku, but the Igbo votes are not going to PDP this time because the zone is unhappy and feels its support for the party since 1999 is not recognised. If you are in their shoes, you will abandon PDP the way Obi rightly did,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nSpeaking further, he predicted that at least 80 percent of Igbo votes would go for Obi, reducing PDP chances.\n\nSam Onikoyi, a Nigerian researcher in Belgium, and keen follower of Nigerian politics since student union days in the university, cried out that in sane societies people will hold political office holders accountable for their promises and actions and also vote against them if they did not deliver on such promises.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s call a spade a spade, and I have relations back home in Nigeria, the people have been put under the harshest conditions under this government. I think, in the western world, voters will send them packing even before election. This may happen in 2023 because Nigerians are not happy and the options being presented have similar traits,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Emordi foresees a dilemma for the APC. \u201cI don\u2019t see the Muslim-Muslim ticket working now. Tinubu is a Muslim and his vice will come from the north and most likely a Muslim. With the many religious-related troubles, such choice may work against the APC.\n\nBut Onikoyi thinks the north could pull a surprise for the first time by allowing a northern Christian to run as Tinubu\u2019s vice.\n\nFor him, Nigeria needs to get the economy working in order to solve all other problems the bad economy caused. \u201cIf we think of economy first, then Peter Obi can be the option. I have seen some of his presentations, they are practicable,\u201d he admitted.\n\nUmelahi has same opinion, but Emordi said the 2019 Atiku/Obi formation would have been the solution for 2023.\n\nCandidates embark on consultations\n\nMeanwhile, as the search for the running mate continues in the two dominant parties; several names have been touted as a possible contender in recent days.\n\nIn the PDP, permutations have continued to intensify on who would be the running mates to Atiku. Different names have been listed as a possible running mate to Atiku.\n\nIn the last few weeks, the names of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, former Senator, Ben Bruce, Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, and former Imo Governor, Emeka Ihedioha have emerged.\n\nSimilarly, some stakeholders have also suggested the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel.\n\nSome PDP chieftains have also suggested the River State Governor Nyesom Wike due to his contribution to the party in recent years.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BusinessDay at the weekend, a chieftain of the PDP, and South West zonal Secretary, Wahab Owokoniran said that Wike stands a better chance ahead of other contenders due his strong personality and contribution to the party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf I have my way, it is Wike. You have to look at his contribution to the party and support he was able to get within the short time he campaigned. It shows his acceptance.\n\n\u201cHe came to Lagos here, and talked about his contribution to the party and you can\u2019t fault him. He held that view throughout his campaign.\u201d\n\nIn the APC, it was gathered that as the search for Tinubu\u2019s running mate continues, he would regularly meet with governors and party leaders to decide on the choice of his running mate in the coming days.\n\nThe spokesman for the Tinubu campaign organisation, Bayo Onanuga, in an interview with journalists last week, said the APC presidential candidate would meet the APC governors who would have a major say in who emerges as his running mate.\n\nBut pundits have advised that for religious balancing, Tinubu\u2019s running mate should be a Christian.\n\nIn recent days, several names have been touted. Those being mentioned are George Akume, Simon Lalong, Yakubu Dogara, Boss Mustapha and Babachir Lawal.\n\nSpeaking on Tinubu\u2019s candidacy, Femi Okurounmu, a former senator and leader of pan-Yoruba social-cultural group, Afenifere, said his victory at the primary was aided by the monetisation of the primary of the APC.\n\nOkorounmu expressed displeasure over Tinubu\u2019s candidacy, saying that his selfish interest brought Yorubas to where they are now.\n\nHe added that his pledge to continue with the policy of President Muhammad Buhari if he wins the 2023 presidential election would further spell doom for Nigeria and plunge it into more crisis.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe victory does not surprise me; politics these days is cash and carry. So, it depends on who you are competing with at the primary.\n\n\u201cWith the kind of primaries conducted these days, the wealthiest man would always win. Nigerians are after money, and I am not surprised, because the richest man among them was Tinubu. It was like the presidential primary in 1993; when MKO Abiola won the SDP ticket, where he used a plane to carry money to the venue of the primary.\n\n\u201cTinubu has not been good to Yoruba, it is his selfish interest that brought Yoruba to where it is today, of what use is he to the Yoruba\u2019s, since the killings began what has he done?\n\n\u201cExcept for the Ondo massacre, he went because of the primary that he was going to attend. What Tinubu said was that he was going to continue with the Buhari policy, policy like RUGA of what use is that to Nigeria?\n\n\u201cIt is a continuation of the implementation of the Fulanisation agenda. You can see that happening around us, just to please a small portion of the people in the society.\n\n\u201cThere is no future for Nigeria, without restructuring the country. Look, the country is more divided now than before and it is because a particular ethnic group has been imposed on the country, they dominate everywhere. Nigeria is not one nation, until we realise that we would not move forward.\u201d\n\nPerplexed Nigerians weigh options\n\nSince the emergence of the candidates, Nigerians have been pondering who among them could be suitable for the country, particularly with the state of the economy and worsening insecurity.\n\nThis riddle could be solved as the candidates begin to embark on nationwide electioneering campaign to sell their manifestoes.",

We are transforming our school system, offering every Edo child the requisite knowledge and skills to compete with their peers in a technology-driven 21st century.\n\n\u201cWe have expanded the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (Edo-BEST) programme to give more children the opportunity to get quality basic education. Our commitment to technical and vocational education will ensure the construction of 20 more technical colleges that will allow children to acquire technical skills as part of our drive to promote industrialisation.\u201d\n\nObaseki said the state government will not fail to prosecute parents and guardians of out-of-school children, as it will deploy necessary steps to take all children off the streets and improve access to education.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThe implementation of the Violence Against Persons (VAP) law also protects our children from all forms of abuse which include the use of children for cheap labour.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United Nations, \u201cthe 2022 theme of the World Day Against Child Labour calls for increased investment in social protection systems and schemes to establish solid social protection floors and protect children from child labour.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu on Saturday, said the commission would soon make its stand known on calls for extension of June 30 deadline for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).\n\nYakubu disclosed this while addressing youths in Lagos State at a Mega Musical Concert on \u2018Youth Vote Count\u2019, organised by INEC in collaboration with some partners to awaken youth consciousness toward participating in politics and governance.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the awareness campaign held at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) aim to mobilise and get youths registered in the CVR.\n\nThe exercise started on Monday with the deployment of 50 INEC Voter Enrolment Devices (IVED) to capture youths in the CVR, culminated in the concert which featured several youth-inspiring musicians, comedians and celebrities.\n\nThe campaign was organised by the electoral umpire in collaboration with the EU Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA), International Press Centre (IPC) and other partners.\n\nThe INEC chairman noted that he was aware that the youth wanted their votes to count with their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), and assured them that they would get their PVCs while their votes would also count in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that you will have your PVCs. We have new machines which will be deployed all over Lagos from next week.\n\n\u201cI know you want to hear from INEC if we are ending the registration on June 30. We have heard you loudly and clearly, You want time until all Nigerians register for PVCs: you will hear from INEC very soon on that.\n\n\u201cYou want to hear from INEC if you register and vote: will your vote count? Your votes will count,\u201d he said.\n\nNAN reports that at this point, the shout of \u201cno rigging, no rigging\u201d filled the air, chorused by teeming youths at the event, the development which disrupted a bit, the address of the INEC chairman.\n\nResponding to them, Yakubu said: \u201d We heard you loudly and clearly. I listened to you, I listened to you very clearly. Once you collect you PVCs, please go and vote. Vote and not fight.\n\n\u201cLet me assure and reassure you, your votes will count,\u201d Yakubu reiterated.\n\nAssessing the success of the Youth Vote Count campaign which started on Monday, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Lagos state said the commission\u2019s goal of mobilising huge number of youths for the CVR had been achieved.\n\nAgbaje, who said that about 10,000 youths were captured within the five-day exercise, said more voter enrolment machines had been deployed to the 20 local government areas of the state to bring more youths into the voting population.\n\nDecrying that many youths had waited till the 11th hour before presenting themselves for registration, Agbaje urged them to move to their various local government areas to register before the expiration of the CVR on June 30.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ensure that we capture as many of them that are eligible before the end of the exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking, the Head of the European Union (EU) delegation to Nigeria, Ms Samuella Isope described the youth turnout as a sign of hope, trust and confidence of youth in the electoral process.\n\nIsope applauded the nation\u2019s new Electoral Act as well as various technologies and innovations that INEC had introduced to make elections more transparent in Nigeria.\n\nThe envoy said that youths needed to be mobilised for electoral processes because they had power to make change happen and make a difference.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up your power. Don\u2019t allow others to be making decisions for you. Come out to register, pick up your PVCs and vote,\u201d Isopi advised.\n\nOne of the organisers, Mr Lanre Arogundade, the Executive Director, International Press Centre, said the current generation of Nigerian youths must take their destiny in their hands by getting involved in the process of choosing leaders.\n\nArogundade urged the youths to join political parties, registering and being active \u201cthis is the only way to change things in this nation. Youths have a civic duty to register and vote in 2023\u201d.\n\nAlso, Mr Samson Itodo, the Executive Director, YIAGA Africa, described as appalling, a situation where Nigerian youths with demographic majority, were not taking part in electoral processes.\n\n\u201cThe young people of Lagos state have a unique opportunity in the next election to make their number count,\u201d Itodo said.\n\nHe encouraged the youths to know that there were reforms within the electoral system that would make their votes to count.\n\nNAN reports that musicians, comedians, and social media influencers among others performed at the event to encourage the youths to get registered, collect their PVCs and vote.\n\nSome of them included: Kizz Daniel; M.I, Teni; Falz; Omawumi; Mayorkun; Waje; JeoBoy; 2Baba; Patoranking; Skiibii; Ashake, Small Doctor; Pasuma, and Bella Shmurda.\n\nOthers were Ufuoma McDermott; Chioma Akpotha; Uti Nwachukwu; Uche Jombo; Lasisi Elenu; Kie Kie; Mr Macaroni; Real Warri Pikin; Omoni Oboli; Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi and Broda Shaggi among other celebrities.\n\nThe only access card to the concert was the PVCs or the Temporary Voter Cards (TVCs).\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Democracy Day: Osun Civil Societies Coalition seeks security, free, fair elections",
          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi\n\nAs Nigeria marks Democracy Day, there is the need for governments at all levels to double their efforts to ensure safety of lives and property, as well as guarantee transparent electoral process, as the nation moves to another election year.\n\nChairman, Osun Civil Societies Coalition (OCSC), Comrade Waheed Lawal, stated this on Sunday when members of the coalition held its annual June 12 rally in Osogbo, Osun State capital.\n\nLawal who decried the state of insecurity in the country expressed disappointment that 29 years after, Nigerians are still facing hardship in all strata of life, stressing that the continued ailing of the economy portends the insensitivity of the nation\u2019s leaders to the plight ot the masses.\n\nHe said: \u201cMKO Abiola represented Hope for a better Nigeria. It is unfortunate that 29 years after the annulment of June 12, Nigeria is still far from its expected development pedestal. It is so unfortunate that even since the return of democracy, our politicians have continued to re-echo the campaign manifesto of the Shagari regime in 1976, as their agenda for Nigeria close to five decades after.\n\n\u201cWe still premise our yardstick of good governance to building roads, schools, providing potable water, electricity and the basic necessities for survival, when nations who got independence after us have moved beyond the basics.\n\n\u201cWe cannot over-emphasize how badly we need a working democracy where the will of the people will suppress the desire of the minority, who have been opportuned to continue to rule us, will manifest.\n\n\u201cThe primary responsibility of every government is provision of adequate security for the protection of lives and property. With starring facts and incidents, Nigeria is far from winning the war against insurgencies, banditry, kidnapping, armed robbery, etc.\n\n\u201cThe recent attack on a catholic church in Owo where many people were killed with scores injured is a sorrowful evidence that insecurity still pervades the country. We condemn the Owo massacre and call on the security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of such dastard act.\u201d\n\nAddressing the members of the public at strategic places when members of the coalition including students, businessmen and women and pro-democracy activism who moved through Ayetoro, Igbona, Olonkoro, Ajegunle, Old Garage, Oke-fia to Olaiya junction all in the state capital, a leader of the movement, Comrade Waheed Saka, called for immediate transfer of the Osun Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode.\n\nSaka condemned the continued harassment, intimidation and killing of harmless citizens by policemen, with a call on the Inspector General of Police to rescue the residents of Osun from Olokode, and \u201chis trigger-happy and blood sucking men.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWithin a year, Osun has recorded no fewer than four deaths to police brutality and extra-judicial killings which crowns the gross misconduct and anti-democracy tenets experienced by Nigerians, pre and post 1999.\n\n\u201cA borehole operator, Kabiru Babai was shot dead by a policeman at Ota-efun, Osogbo, on December 3, 2021. On July 27, 2021, Mr Saheed Olabomi, a relative of Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oba Abdulrasheed Olabomi, was also shot dead by a mobile policeman at Islahudeen Area, Oke-Onitea, Osogbo. Also, on April 4, 2022 Mr Abiola Afolabi, a young businessman was shot dead in the middle of the night by the police at Zone II, Osogbo. A 24-year-old man, Olufemi Oriyomi, was allegedly tortured to death by the police. On May 31, a journalist, Toba Adedeji was also shot by the police who were dispersing protesters at Olaiya, Osogbo, with live bullets.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Wale Olokode, has always been manipulating facts on cases of police brutality and extrajudicial killings. We demand that the Inspector General of Police should investigate all the cases of police extortion, illegal arrest and detention, brutality and extrajudicial killings, among other misconducts where characterised the police operations under the leadership of CP Wale Olokode.\n\n\u201cEqually, we want CP Wale Olokode to be transferred out of Osun because of his brazen neglect and continued shield for his trigger-happy officials. The conduct of the police boss have so far shown how inhumane, selfish and unpatriotic he is to the sanctity of lives which he swore to protect.\u201d\n\nCorroborating him, Comrade Ayo Ologun, a member of the OCSC stressed the need for a free, fair and transparent process in the build-up to the July 16 governorship election in Osun and the general election, next year.\n\n\u201cThe governorship election in Osun State is coming up on July 16, a month to this time. The precept of democracy which we are celebrating today is for the people to have free will of choosing who represent them in government. We demand from INEC, security agencies, political parties and all other stakeholders that the governorship election must be free, fair, transparent, credible and violent free.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in its entirety, the destruction of campaign billboards of governorship candidates in the state. The act remains a tenet of an uncivilized and unhealthy democracy, which Nigerian Politics and its players should have grown from. We equally demand a free and fair election, devoid of any form of rigging for the 2023 General Elections.\u201d\n\nResidents of the state showered encomiums on members of the Osun Civil Societies Coalition (OCSC), stressing that the movement has been instrumental to entrenching the tenets of democracy and justice, as well as timely demands for good governance in the society.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe AnyiChuks Campaign Organization, the campaign organization of Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Ebonyi State governorship election, has appealed to party members to close ranks with a view to achieving the much needed liberation of the state in 2023.\n\nThis is as it dismissed claims by Senator Obinna Ogba that he remained the authentic candidate of the main opposition party in the state, warning that the much needed cohesion within the party could not be achieved through \u201cfalsehood or the telling of blatant lies.\u201d\n\nSenator Ogba, chairman of senate committee on sports, who emerged candidate in a now nullified rescheduled governorship primary held on Sunday, June 5, had addressed a press conference on Saturday, insisting that he remained the authentic candidate of the party in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal high court sitting in Abakaliki, had on Tuesday, June 7, nullified the rescheduled primary election, which was boycotted by ad-hoc party delegates, pronouncing it illegal, unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nAddressing Ogba\u2019s claims in a statement on Sunday by its director of media and publicity, Abia Onyike, the AnyiChucks Campaign Organization maintained that the Lagos-based industrialist is the only PDP governorship candidate whose name has since been submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAccording to Onyike in the statement titled, \u2018The Time for Truth and Reconciliation has Come,\u2019 the crisis in the party cannot persist without a resolution and the time to resolve it has come.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish to refer to the Press Conference addressed yesterday, 11th June, 2022 by Sen. Obinna Ogba and to react as follows:\n\n\u201cThe crisis rocking the PDP in Ebonyi state is a self-inflicted logjam which came about because of weak leadership. However, the crisis cannot persist without a resolution and the time to resolve it has come, if the party must rise to the occasion in the state as a liberation movement in the hands of Ebonyi people to rescue themselves from the atrocities of the incumbent APC Government in the state.\n\n\u201cThe resolution of the crisis could be achieved not through falsehood or the telling of blatant lies to the suffering people of Ebonyi. Our teeming members and the ordinary people on the streets need to be told the true situation of things so that they can face the situation squarely and take their destiny into their own hands.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governorship Candidate today is Dr Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi. He won the Primary Election conducted by the PDP on 28 and 29 of May, 2022. The 3-man Delegates List used for the Primary Election was the outcome of the State PDP Congress of 7th May, 2022 which was eventually recognised by the PDP National Working Committee(NWC). That Primary Election was properly authorized by the PDP NWC and was peacefully conducted with the INEC mornitoring the exercise in line with the Electoral Guidelines and the 2022 Electoral Act. An attempt by the opposition to cancel the successfully conducted Primary Election suffered a set-back.\u201d\n\nThe Campaign Organisation emphasized that the rescheduled primary which produced Ogba was undemocratic, and had been pushed for by forces that didn\u2019t like the fact that Dr. Odii emerged candidate.\n\n\u201cThe parallel primaries conducted on the 4th and 5th of June, was an anti-democratic intervention by some powerful forces who were hell-bent on reversing the popular will of the people. The ruling of the Federal High Court in Abakaliki on 7th June, 2022 restoring the authenticity of the first Primaries which elected Dr Odi was a historic confirmation of the democratic will of Ebonyi PDP cadres as against the dictatorship and imposition by a few Godfathers,\u201d Onyike said.\n\n\u201cOn the 10th of June, 2022, the National body of the Party obeyed the Court Order by forwarding the names of all the candidates elected during the legitimate Primaries of 28 and 29 June, 2022 to INEC and the processing of their forms have commenced.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governorship Candidate in the person of Dr Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi is willing and ready to provide leadership and to reconcile the members of the party after the divisions arising from the internal power struggle.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the Leaders and members of our great Party in the state to embrace the path of maturity and reconciliation at this moment to enable us focus on the common enemy as we gradually approach the 2023 general elections. We should quickly recover from the fallouts of the primary elections and close ranks in the interest of our people and the future of the state.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that his administration will continue to ensure their protection from both external and internal enemies.\n\nThe president who made the promise in his Democracy Day speech also said he will ensure credible elections in 2023, promising a free, fair and transparent electoral process.\n\nHe pleaded with citizens to support his government in its effort to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nFull Speech Below:\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June the 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\nIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\nWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\nFellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nIt is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nI am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\nI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\nAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\nAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\nI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\nFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\nThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\nI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\nOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\nFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\nWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\nOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\nI will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\nI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u2022 Being an address by President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of the commemoration and celebration of Democracy Day 2022",

One of those involved in the consultation for Tinubu\u2019s running mate pointed out that the party might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nReliable sources close to Tinubu also indicated that the former Lagos State governor would rely on the input of the President Muhammadu Buhari and members of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum on who should be his running mate.\n\nThe pressure to pick a Muslim as his running mate, it was learnt, was to assuage his many supporters in the North due to indications that there were no popular Christian politicians to sway votes in favour of the APC in the region.\n\nA source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the sensitive issue, affirmed that four men were in contest for the position. The source said, \u201cWe have Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State; a former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima; Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State; and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that the Governor of Borno State, Prof Babagana Zulum, made a case for Shettima when Tinubu visited the state during his consultation with delegates. Shettima is a strong supporter of the APC candidate and he spoke out in Tinubu\u2019s defence after his Abeokuta outburst.\n\nAnother source noted, \u201cHowever, the President and the members of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum will play key roles in deciding the running mate. You will be surprised to know that Zulum made a case for Shettima when Asiwaju visited Borno during the campaign. He said, \u2018Jagaban, please I am going to ask for two favours from you. I want you to pay attention to my state and also consider my principal, Senator Shettima, as your running mate. He has good things to offer and you will enjoy him\u2019.\n\n\u201cFor now, the running mate may have to come from these four men.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that Lalong\u2019s name was dropped because he\u2019s known to be very close to the former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who came second during the primary.\n\nThe source said, \u201cFrom fresh considerations, we cannot pick Lalong or Boss Mustapha. Apart from his closeness to Amaechi, a factor we are not very comfortable with, Lalong is from the North-Central, which is not a core northern state. Plateau is also considered not to be strategic enough to win elections in northern Nigeria. Using him will be like alienating the entire northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cConcerning Boss Mustapha, well, he is not with us. Though he belonged to the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria like Tinubu, he does not identify with him. He was not part of our campaign and has yet to visit the aspirant (as of Saturday afternoon) since he won the primary.\n\n\u201cIn his home state of Adamawa, it\u2019s known that Mustapha cannot win an election there. So, why will you impose such a man on an aspirant that needs the huge votes from the northern region?\u201d\n\nSome stakeholders and chieftains of the APC, on Saturday, urged the party\u2019s presidential candidate to allow the northern APC governors to choose his running mate.\n\nThey argued that since the northern governors suggested that the party should zone its presidential ticket to the South, they were still in a better position to field a running mate.\n\nThe Director-General, Voice of Nigeria and foundation member of the APC, Osita Okechukwu, told one of our correspondents, \u201cOn the issue of the running mate, I will advise our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to weigh the opinion of the northern governors on this matter. They stand in a better position, better than any other organ of the party, in consultation with Mr President to give us a candidate.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the APC Rebirth Group, Aliyu Audu, said, \u201cThe northern governors sat and decided that the ticket should go to the South. The same set of people should be able to decide who will be the running mate. It is not just up to the candidate. It is up to the party.\u201d\n\nThe APC\u2019s first national secretary, Tijjani Tumsah, also stated, \u201cTinubu\u2019s criteria should be competence, a known value addition to the ticket and someone who can deliver. We should not be limited by religion or some other criteria. His criteria should be a competent person from the North.\u201d\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, efforts to reach Tinubu\u2019s spokesperson, Mr Tunde Rahman, proved abortive as he neither responded to calls or an SMS sent to him.\n\nResponding to the rejection of Muslim-Muslim ticket by the Christian Association of Nigeria and counter-claims by the Muslim Rights Concern, the Director, Legal Directorate, Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Babatunde Ogala (SAN), told Sunday PUNCH that the APC would not pander to such sentiment.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat is the business of CAN in politics? That is what I don\u2019t understand? Was CAN there when we were doing our convention? Do they know the processes of how our candidate emerged? I think CAN, MURIC and other religious bodies should concentrate on their religion and stop heating up the polity. The party has not come up with any position; so why the issue of threats? What is their own with issuing threats?\n\n\u201cWe will pick the best (running mate) for our party who can deliver the election for us; they should allow the people to decide what they want.\u201d\n\n(PUNCH)",

          "text": "The federal government is working hard to address the lingering security challenges in some parts of the country and ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nThe President said this Sunday in a nationwide broadcast to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day anniversary in honour of the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola.\n\nThe President stressed the need for Nigerians to be actively involved in the fight against insecurity, saying that addressing security challenges should not be left for the government alone.\n\n\u201cI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n\u201cOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n\u201cFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n\u201cWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n\u201cOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security,\u201d he said.\n\nHe assured of his commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n\u201cI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation,\u201d he said.\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.

          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, President Muhammadu Buhari said Sunday that he remains committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nThe President said this in a nationwide broadcast to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day anniversary in honour of the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola.\n\nHe said in the last seven years, the present administration has made significant investments to reform the country\u2019s electoral laws, systems and processes to safeguard electorate\u2019s votes, stressing that the right of Nigerians to choose their government would be respected.\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n\u201cAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n\u201cI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n\u201cFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n\u201cThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also expressed satisfaction with the conduct of primary elections by political parties and called on politicians and electorate to run issues-based campaigns ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cRecently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n\u201cI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n\u201cAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also spoke on the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election said to to have been won by the late Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, saying that Nigerians must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of the country\u2019s democracy during 1993.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n\u201cOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n\u201cWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT\n\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\n12TH JUNE, 2022\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate the freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th, 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th, 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issue-based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue-focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this, however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s overall security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "The World Trade Organization chief voiced cautious optimism Sunday as global trade ministers gathered to tackle food security threatened by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, overfishing and equitable access to Covid vaccines.\n\nOpening the WTO\u2019s first ministerial meeting in nearly five years, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said to \u201cexpect a rocky, bumpy road with a few landmines along the way\u201d.\n\nBut she told journalists she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the more than 100 attending ministers would manage to agree on at least one or two of a long line of pressing issues, and that would be \u201ca success\u201d.\n\nThe WTO faces pressure to eke out long-sought trade deals on a range of issues and show unity amid the still raging pandemic and an impending global hunger crisis.\n\nBut since the global trade body only makes decisions by consensus, it can be more than tricky to reach agreements.\n\nTop of the agenda at the four-day meeting is the toll Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, traditionally a breadbasket that feeds hundreds of millions of people, is having on food security.\n\nWalkout\n\nTensions ran high during a closed-door session, where a number of delegates took the floor to condemn Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, including Kyiv\u2019s envoy, who was met with a standing ovation, WTO spokesman Dan Pruzin told journalists.\n\nThen, right before Russian Minister of Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov spoke, around three dozen delegates \u201cwalked out\u201d, he said.\n\nEven before the conference began, the European Union gathered representatives from 57 countries for a show solidarity with Ukraine, with EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis slamming Russia\u2019s \u201cillegal and barbaric aggression\u201d\n\nDespite the contentious atmosphere, ministers are expected to agree on a joint declaration on strengthening food security, in which they will \u201ccommit to take concrete steps to facilitate trade and improve the functioning and longterm resilience of global markets for food and agriculture\u201d.\n\nAccording to the draft text, countries would vow that \u201cparticular consideration will be given to the specific needs and circumstances of developing country Members\u201d.\n\n\u201cI hope you will collectively do the right thing,\u201d Ngozi told the delegates.\n\nFisheries deal in sight?\n\nThe WTO hopes to keep criticism of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine to the first day of talks, allowing ministers to focus in the following days on nailing down trade deals, after nearly a decade with no major agreements.\n\nThere is some optimism that countries could finally agree on banning subsidies that contribute to illegal and unregulated fishing, after more than two decades of negotiations.\n\n\u201cWill our children forgive us\u2026 if we allow our oceans to be depleted?\u201d Okonjo-Iweala said.\n\nOne of the main sticking points has been so-called special and differential treatment (SDT) for developing countries, including major fishing nation India, which can request exemptions.\n\nThe duration of exemptions remains undefined, with environmental groups warning anything beyond 10 years would be catastrophic.\n\nIndia blocking\n\nIndia has demanded a 25-year exemption, and is so far refusing to budge.\n\nIndian Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal insisted in a video address that most fishing in India is vital for survival, and that fishermen use \u201csustainable methods\u201d.\n\n\u201cTheir right to life and livelihood cannot be curtailed in any manner.\u201d\n\nAngered by lacking follow-through on promises made at a WTO ministerial meeting nearly a decade ago for food policy measures, India is proving intransigent on other issues as well, jeopardising the chances of locking down deals.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single issue that India is not blocking,\u201d a Geneva-based ambassador said, singling out WTO reform and agriculture.\n\nPatent waiver?\n\nIndia has also struck a harsh tone on another key issue on the table: WTO response to the Covid crisis.\n\n\u201cThe rich countries need to introspect. We need to bow our heads in shame for our inability to respond to the pandemic in time,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia and South Africa began in October 2020 pushing for the WTO to temporarily lift intellectual property rights on Covid-19 medical tools like vaccines to help ensure more equitable access in poorer nations.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of talks, the EU, the United States, India and South Africa hammered out a compromise.\n\nThe text, which would allow most developing countries, although not China, to produce Covid vaccines without authorisation from patent holders, still faces opposition from both sides.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry insists the waiver would undermine investment in innovation, while public interest groups charge the text falls far short of what is needed, by limiting and complicating the vaccine waiver and not covering Covid treatments and diagnostics.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Full text of President Buhari's 2022 Democracy Day Speech",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has again said Nigeria and indeed Nigerians, will not forget the sacrifices of heroes of democracy in the 1993 struggles.\n\nHe made this remark on Sunday during a statewide broadcast to mark this year\u2019s democracy day celebration.\n\nRead the full text below\n\nTHIS DEMOCRACY DAY, 2022 SPEECH IS RELEASED TO YOU STRICTLY UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL 7.30 AM, JUNE 12, 2022 AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAS READ IT. KINDLY REFRAIN FROM USE ON YOUR ONLINE PLATFORMS OR ANY PLATFORM WHATSOEVER UNTIL THE AFOREMENTIONED TIME.\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT\n\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\n12TH JUNE, 2022\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "Some students of Nigerian public universities have expressed frustration over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nASUU has been on strike since February and all efforts to make lecturers return to the classrooms have not yielded results.\n\nSome of the students in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt, appealed to the federal government to meet at least 50 per cent of ASUU demands to end the strike.\n\nA third-year student of the University of Port Harcourt, Greatness Nnamdi, who is studying gas engineering, said that the ongoing strike was impacting negatively on the plans of Nigerian students.\n\nHe said although he enrolled for a five-year programme in 2017, he was still in the first semester of the third year because of the ASUU constant strike and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cMy mates who left Nigeria to study abroad have graduated, some are in their final year and it seems those of us in Nigeria are forgotten.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect students who spent most of their time on strike and who also studied without properly equipped laboratories to come out with good grades or become experts in their fields.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the federal government to put in some efforts to meet the demands of ASUU, at least 50 per cent and this will also make the lecturers not depend on students for their upkeep.\n\n\u201cI plead with the government to bring back hope for Nigerian youths, our plans and programmes are slowing down.\n\n\u201cI also plead with the government to employ young graduates to teach new technologies and innovations in our universities,\u201d Nnamdi-Ikpo said.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the University of Calabar, Ms Gift Nwafor, who studying education psychology, said that the ongoing strike had frustrated and setback her studies.\n\nNwafor expressed displeasure at the ongoing strike, saying that the action was leading some students into crime.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am very sad and frustrated. My two siblings and I have been at home since Feb. 14 and our rent for this year would soon expire without being in school.\n\n\u201cMy greatest fear is that some of us have gone into crimes\u2026 They are into theft, raping and consumption of hard drugs.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the federal government and ASUU to consider our future and call off the strike so that we can go back to school,\u201d Nwafor said.\n\nASUU Chairman at the Abia State University, Mr. victor Nkemdirim, attributed the strike to the non-revitalisation of public universities in the country.\n\nNkemdirim told NAN that ASUU was fighting for the revitalisation of the institutions.\n\nHe said since 2009 the government has been unable to implement its agreements with ASUU.\n\nHe said that the government had always reneged on the Memorandum of Understanding and the Memorandum of Action it signed with the lecturers.\n\nHe stated that since the founding of some public universities, the government`s presence there had been minimal, except for projects embarked by the Petroleum Trust Fund(PTF) which came about as a result of ASUU agitations.\n\nNkemdirim said if not for ASUU\u2019s continued struggles, most of the states and federal universities would have gone under by now.\n\nHe also recalled that ASUU had continued to oppose the Integrated Pay Roll and Personnel Information System(IPPIS), a foreign-based platform, which he said the Federal Government was servicing yearly with N7 billion.\n\n\u201cThis (IPPIS) platform contravenes the university autonomy which means that the council of the universities do not have the right to employ or dismiss staff.\n\n\u201cASUU was asked to develop a platform that is congenial to the university system and it came up with University Transability and Accountability Solution (UTAS) which in all tests, including the integrity test, scored 99.7 per cent pass mark.\n\n\u201cWe have also decided to fight for the upgrade of our salaries. We have been receiving the same salary since 2009 while our counterparts\n\nin the polytechnics and colleges of education are earning more than us.\n\n\u201cAll these reasons are why ASUU is still on strike. I, therefore, urge the state and Federal Government to understand that education is paramount to the development of the Nigerian system in its entirety,\u201d Nkemdirim explained.\n\nFunmi Ogundare",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s 2023 Elections Can\u2019t Be Rigged, INEC Says as It Considers Voter Registration Extention",
          "text": "Following insinuation that the 2023 general election could be rigged scientifically, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, Saturday vowed that the commission would do everything in its power to protect the sanctity of the ballot\n\nYakubu has also promised that the commission would get feedback concerning the calls for the extension of the Continuous Voters\u2019 Registration (CVR).\n\nYakubu spoke at a pre-event dinner organised on Saturday by the European Union (EU), where Nigeria\u2019s music stars featured in the Youth Vote Count 2.0 mega concert held at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos, interacted with officials of the commission.\n\nHe promised that the electoral body would ensure that all eligible Nigerians willing to register as voters in the current CVR exercise are allowed to do so.\n\nYakubu has also allayed the fears being expressed in certain quarters that the 2023 elections could be rigged, promising that the commission would do everything in its power to protect the sanctity of the ballot.\n\nHe debunked the claim that the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) would expire, clarifying that the PVCs have no expiry date.\n\nOn the fears being expressed in certain quarters that elections could be rigged, the INEC Chairman said the commission would do everything in its power to protect the sanctity of the ballot.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been hearing many stories about \u2018scientific rigging\u2019 or \u2018photochromic ballot papers\u2019 where, according to them, when you thumbprint for a party of your choice, your vote will move to another political party on the ballot paper as it drops inside the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThe best way to protect the sanctity of the ballot is what happens at the polling unit. There are no collation centres where ballot boxes are taken to. The ballot boxes are emptied, sorted out, the votes are counted, recorded on a result sheet, and then uploaded to the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV)\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll like to advise all of you to register on the IReV portal. On election day, when voting ends at the polling unit, the results are immediately uploaded to the portal once the processes are completed. We are the first and so far, the only election management body in Africa that does so. We started it in August 2010 with the Nasarawa State Constituency bye-election. So, you can see the result of your polling unit on election day. And since we started, I keep asking: is there any discrepancy between the result uploaded to the IReV and the results given to polling agents at the polling units? I haven\u2019t heard of any. So, be rest assured that we will protect the sanctity of the ballot, first at the most important level, which is the polling unit, and subsequently the results that are collated at the different levels.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman also debunked the rumour making the rounds that the commission was deliberately preventing registrants from a particular section of the country from registering in the current exercise.\n\nResponding to calls for an extension of the CVR due to the surge in the number of young people trooping the commission\u2019s offices across the country to register, Yakubu said: \u201cWe are concerned like all Nigerians. We are appreciative of the fact that young people and Nigerians generally are trooping out in large numbers to register.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a measure of confidence that people have in the system and that is why they are coming out to register. We\u2019ll never let the young people of Nigeria down. Whatever it takes, we will ensure that those who are seeking to register to have the opportunity to do so.\n\n\u201cYesterday in Abuja, we invited all the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) nationwide and we discussed what we can do to ensure that no Nigerian is left out in the current voter registration exercise. What we identified immediately is that we need additional equipment, and we need to create additional registration centres.\n\n\u201cSo, in addition to what we did earlier, the commission has approved 209 additional machines to be deployed to ease the pressure nationwide. And we identified three areas of pressure based on the discussion we had: the entire South-east region; the big apple \u2013 Lagos, and Kano. There is also pressure coming from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). We\u2019ll continue to respond to the pressure.\n\n\u201cFor this concert, the commission deployed 30 additional machines to Lagos, which they used for the CVR exercise since Monday (6th June). These machines are not going back to Abuja. They will remain in Lagos to respond to the pressure.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cINEC will do whatever it takes to ensure that Nigerians can register, vote and we\u2019ll protect the votes cast by Nigerians. INEC is not a political party. The choice of who becomes whatever in Nigeria democratically lies in the hands of Nigerians. Our responsibility is to protect the voter.\u201d\n\nYakubu said the INEC would, within the next one week, observe the effects of the remedies being put in place to ease the pressure and take further action based on the outcome of the observation.\n\nHe urged the music stars to take advantage of their large followership to encourage young people to register, collect their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) and vote on election day.\n\nHe told them: \u201cThere are some things I would like you to please the bear in mind. Messaging is very important, and you are the masters and mistresses of messaging. When you say one thing, a million people will listen to you. But I would have to say the same thing a thousand times before I get 10 people to listen to me.\n\n\u201cThere are three messages I want you to emphasise: Encourage young people to register, but that is only the first step. The second step is that, when they register, they have to collect their PVCs, because registering is one thing, collecting the PVC is another. You can\u2019t go to the polling unit on election day and say \u2013 here I come INEC, I\u2019ve registered. You won\u2019t vote until you have your PVC. Then, they should use the PVCs, come out and vote on election day. The message consistently is to vote, not fight. Register, collect your PVCs and vote. They have a friend in INEC\u201d.\n\nYakubu also debunked another rumour that the PVCs would expire, insisting that the PVCs have no expiration date.\n\nTHISDAY",

          "title": "CBN Unveils Plans to Introduce USSD Code to Improve eNaira",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said it is set to introduce the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) code as part of steps to improve the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nThis development is coming as the National Pension Commission (PenCom) disclosed that Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) registered 93,114 Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs), in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022.\n\nCBN\u2019s Deputy Governor, Dr Kingsley Obiora, disclosed the apex bank\u2019s efforts to improve eNaira at the IMF African Department Speakers Series held virtually at the weekend.\n\nThe series was focused on \u201cCBDC and Private Digital Payments in Kenya and Nigeria: Challenges and Opportunities for Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nThe CBN inaugurated the CBDC, also known as the eNaira, on October 25, 2021, aimed at making financial transactions easier and seamless for every stratum of society.\n\nObiora said the introduction of the USSD code became necessary to improve financial inclusion in the country and to ensure people without smartphones could still transact on the eNaira platform.\n\n\u201cWe have made serious progress in the last seven to eight years because when the current governor resumed in 2014, one of the pillars of his vision was to significantly improve financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cSo at the time, we were at 48 per cent of our population within the financial system and given several policies that he conceived and implemented, we are almost at 70 per cent.\n\n\u201cThat still leaves us with about 30 per cent of our population out of the financial system and we believe the CBDC can help reduce that number even more.\n\n\u201cA lot of people might not have smartphones but that is essentially the next step of our improvement in the CBDC, to introduce the USSD code, so those that do not have smartphones can still transact,\u201d Obiora said.\n\nThe CBN deputy governor said that the barrier to entry on the CBDC platform was low, which, he said made it possible for everyone with a Bank Verification Number (BVN) to be onboarded into the eNaira platform in a few minutes.\n\nObiora said the value of the country\u2019s digital payments grew from $324 billion in 2008 to about $2.4 trillion presently, adding that Nigerians were now used to digital payments.\n\n\u201cAs you know, within the continent we have one of the largest Fintech companies, Futterwave, Paystack, etc,\u201d the apex bank boss added.\n\nHe said that the CBDC had significant benefits for Nigeria, which was why the CBN decided to introduce it.\n\nObiora listed the benefits to include rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct welfare payments to citizens, and reducing the informal economy.\n\nOthers are improving tax collection, boosting cross-border trade and remittances, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of payments and just endearing economic growth in general.\n\nHe, however, listed some of the key risks to CBDC to include banking sector disintermediation, operational risks of knowing that there is non-stop service, cyber security risks, internet disruptions and financial literacy.\n\nObiora said that Nigeria was doing well based on a PwC report, which showed that the country was number one in terms of adoption, adding that the CBN would keep growing and improving on the system.\n\nSpeaking on adopting cryptocurrency in Nigeria, the deputy governor said for now it would not become part of the country\u2019s financial system because of the volatility that it could create for the system.\n\nCommenting on the high cost of food and fuel in Nigeria caused by the war in Ukraine, he said that the problem was more political than economic.\n\n\u201cWe hope that world leaders will sort this out as quickly as possible because ordinary people who have no egos and did not cause this problem are the ones that are suffering the most.\n\n\u201cWithin Nigeria what we are seeing is that farm gate food prices have either stabilised or reduced, whereas in the market it has increased.\u201d\n\nObiora said a lot of the problems with rising food inflation were due to logistic problems and the issue of higher prices of fuel and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to deal with that by investing a bit in a commodity exchange so that they can stabilise prices.\n\nHe said, \u201cwithin the monetary policy committee, rates will be raised at least to signal that we will continue to keep an eye on inflation and stand ready to do whatever it takes to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAccording to the moderator, Director, African Department, IMF, Mr Abebe Selassie, the series is a platform where Africa\u2019s pressing economic policy issues are discussed and organised by the IMF\u2019s African Department.\n\nSelassie said the series provided an opportunity for policymakers, academics, and analysts to offer their perspectives on economic and policy issues relevant to the IMF\u2019S African constituency.\n\nPFAs Registered 93,114 Retirement Savings Accounts in Q1, Says PenCom\n\nIn another development, the PenCom has disclosed that PFAs registered 93,114 Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs), in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, according to a statement posted on its official website at the weekend.\n\nThe report showed that the PFAs registered 93,114 RSAs during the quarter under review, which brought the cumulative RSA registrations from inception to 9,621,979 as of March 31.\n\nThe report stated that the total RSA Transfer was 7,663, which was concluded in the first week of April 2022.\n\n\u201cThis covered RSA transfer requests, submitted by PFAs between January 1, and March 31, which were eligible for RSA transfer in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cOut of the total RSA transfers initiated, 5,543 RSAs were transferred to their new PFAs, along with their associated pension assets, while 2,120 transfer requests failed.\n\n\u201cThe failed submissions by PFAs could be attributed to their internal processes, as all the PFAs recorded some failed RSA transfer request submissions,\u201d the report said.\n\nAlso, the report stated that PenCOM received an application from the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), to transfer NSITF contributions, on behalf of 218 NSITF contributors during the quarter under review.\n\n\u201cApproval was granted to transfer N11.53 million to the RSAs of 213 contributors; on a similar note, the commission approved monthly pensions in the sum of N40.47 million to 2,304 NSITF pensioners,\u201d it said\n\nThe report also stated that the compliance by state governments to the status of Implementation of the CPS and other Schemes as of Q1 2022 is impressive.\n\n\u201c25 States of the Federation had enacted pension laws on the CPS, while eight states are at the bill stage, four states adopted the Contributory Defined Benefits Scheme (CDBS).\u201d\n\nPenCom added that it received 11,200 applications from private sector organisations for the issuance of Pension Clearance Certificates (PCCs).\n\n\u201cOut of this number, PCCs were issued to 10,541 organisations, while 659 applications were in the approval process as of March 31.\n\n\u201cThe records showed that the 10,541 organisations\u2019 actions had remitted a total sum of N59,39 billion into the RSAs of their employees, totalling 45,170,\u201d it added.\n\nFestus Akanbi",
