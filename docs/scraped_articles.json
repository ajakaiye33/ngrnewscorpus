          "text": "\u2026.Says we protect female folks against predators\n\n\n\nBy Shina Abubakar\n\nThe Management of Obafemi Awolowo University, OAU, Ile-Ife, in Osun State, Wednesday, reiterated its commitment to protecting members of the university\u2019s community, especially female folks, against sexual predators in the institution.\n\n\n\nIt also dismissed insinuations that the university is attempting to shield a professor accused of alleged sexual assault against a student in the school.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that Boluwatife Bababunmi of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages petitioned the university, alleging that a Professor of Yoruba Incantations and Stylistics, Joseph Opefeyitimi, had sexually assaulted her.\n\n\n\nHowever, the university, in a statement by its Public Relations Officer, Abiodun Olarewaju, stated that the rumour of cover-up or foot-dragging over the matter is unfounded, saying it has sacked three of its lecturers over such acts in the past.\n\n\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe management of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, would like to debunk an unfounded allegation making the rounds in some quarters that it\u2019s foot-dragging in sanctioning a professor, who was alleged to have sexually assaulted a female student in his office.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the authorities of the Obafemi Awolowo University have never shielded and will not shield any staff or student found to have committed any sexual misdemeanour. Previous cases of this nature have not evaded the disciplinary hammer of the University administration.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe unwholesome incident, which happened on the 18th of March, 2022, prompted Boluwatife Bababunmi of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages to write a petition to the University Management against Joseph Opefeyitimi, a professor of Yoruba Incantations and Stylistics, of the same department, on March 21, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cProcedurally, after the receipt of the formal complaints, the first step was that the departmental committee sat on the matter and, after a thorough investigation, Professor Opefeyitimi was found prima facie liable.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecond stage was at the Faculty level and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Professor Niyi Okunoye referred the matter to the anti-sexual harassment committee of the University. The committee, which also sat and clinically deliberated on this same matter, recommended appropriate disciplinary actions against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi to the University Management.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the University administration would have to present its recommendations to the Governing Council which has the final say on the matter, considering the status of the staff involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe present University Management does not condone sexual rascality of any form, under any guise against any member of the University community from anybody. We also pledge to continue to protect our students, particularly the female ones, against any sexual predator, no matter how highly placed.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It has gotten over the issue of community police.\n\n\u201cIt is now State Police. It is from that State Police that we can now be talking about community police,\u201d he said.\n\nObasanjo advocated the strengthening of the traditional system and local government administration which he prepared during the Murtala/Obasanjo administration.\n\n\u201cI believe there is a need to enable that tier of government to work truly like a local government. They have their own Executive, Judiciary and Legislature.\n\n\u201cThey were working and were very visible. Building and managing roads, looking into education, health, local administration, agriculture. But they were all gone,\u201d he lamented.\n\nObasanjo added that the experience of the ex-chairmen in local government administration was enough to aspire for higher posts.\n\nObasanjo, who was presented with a letter of a Life Patron, assured that he would look into their request and always be available on request.",

The school is to complement their efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe national president said that the neglect of parental responsibility at home had made it a task for schools to achieve much progress.\n\nOtubela said the faulty background of a child would hinder effective collaboration with the school management to address the identified challenges.\n\nHe said that only effective collaboration between the school and the home would help to bring out a morally rich child.\n\n\u201cIt is sad to note that this much-needed collaboration has been lacking in our educational system due to societal pressure, which has created a communication gap between the school and home.\n\n\u201cParents are not usually present to monitor their children at home due to pressure from work and unending heavy vehicular traffic, especially in the city.\n\n\u201cThis makes many parents leave home as early as 5 am and return home from 9 pm in the evening, so there is no quality time with the children,\u201d he said.\n\nOtubela said that due to the gross reduction in moral values, parents should pay special attention to the emotional needs of their children.\n\nAccording to him, since technological devices became imperative to advance the course of mankind, parents must ensure that they devised a means to monitor what their children watch to restrict them from accessing adult sites at home.\n\nHe said that some television programmes, including reality TV shows, should be properly censored by appropriate government agencies before allowing them on cable TV.\n\nOtubela advised that every school should have a child protection policy in place to properly engage parents, staff members, students and other stakeholders on how to ensure strict adherence to the instructions contained in the policy.\n\n\u201cTechnological devices used by students in schools must be restricted to ensure students are limited to educational sites only.\n\n\u201cParenting programmes should also be organised periodically by the school authorities to sensitise parents and the school on how to appropriately deal with negative issues regarding their children,\u201d he said.\n\nOtubela, who condemned in its entirety the act as depicted in the said video involving the minors, appealed for caution from members of the public.\n\nHe called on the public to refrain from making unsavoury comments over the issue for the sake of the mental well-being of the minors involved.\n\nHe further appealed to relevant stakeholders to pay equal attention in counselling the boy-child just \u201cas it is done for the girl-child as both need to be fully guarded and provided for as they approach puberty.\u2019\u2019",

You can spend N228 billion to feed children in primary and secondary schools, but you cannot raise N200 billion to fund your universities; it is an issue of priority, that is the problem.\u201d\n\nOsodeke said the government had refused to make any definite move to address the demands of the lecturers since the strike which crippled academic activities across public universities in the country began in February.\n\nAccording to him, nothing concrete has happened, adding that the federal government had not shown any sign that it was willing to resolve the issues.\n\nThe ASUU president said that no concrete resolution was reached despite the series of meetings with the government delegation led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen Chris Ngige.\n\nOsodeke added: \u201cReally, nothing significant has happened since we declared the strike about nine weeks ago, which means that this system (government) is really not interested in anything about education,\u201d Osodeke stated.\n\n\u201cIf all universities are shut down for about nine weeks and there is no single comment from the government\u2019s side, it shows that something is really wrong.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe duo of Yemi Osinbajo, Vice President and presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peter Obi, former Governor of Anambra State and presidential aspirant under the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) have emerged as the most preferred presidential aspirants in the upcoming Nigeria general elections scheduled for February 2023.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThis result is from a survey conducted by Nextier, a multi-competency advisory firm, and Data-Tier, a data analytics and digital communications firm, and released Thursday.\n\nAccording to a statement by Nextier, and Data-Tier, please explained that the survey aimed to gauge Nigerians\u2019 preferences for a presidential candidate, understand the challenges they would like the next government to address promptly, and decipher how ethnic and gender biases would inform the next election.\n\nFrom the 467 responses, the most preferred candidate for president were Peter Obi (46 percent), Yemi Osinbajo (28 percent), Bola Tinubu (7.5 percent) and Atiku Abubakar (3 percent). The most preferred candidates for the vice presidency were Aminu Tambuwal (28 percent), Musa Kwankwaso (19 percent), Peter Obi (16 percent), Bukola Saraki (6.9 percent), Nyesom Wike (6.4 percent) and Yemi Osinbajo (5.8 percent).\n\nAssessing the responses from a geopolitical dimension, the presidential preference for respondents from southern Nigeria were Peter Obi (51.2 percent) and Yemi Osinbajo (26.6 percent). For the position of Vice President, these same respondents preferred Aminu Tambuwal (30.2 percent), Peter Obi (16.6 percent) and Musa Kwankwaso (16.6 percent).\n\nNo other candidates polled up to 10 percent in either of the categories.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe presidential preferences for respondents from northern Nigeria were Yemi Osinbajo (34.2 percent), Peter Obi (20 percent), and Musa Kwankwaso (13.2 percent). The respondents\u2019 preferences for the vice presidency were Musa Kwankwaso (32.9 percent), Aminu Tambuwal (17.1 percent) and Peter Obi (14.4 percent). No other candidates polled up to 10 percent in either of the categories.\n\nThe survey asked the respondent to rank the 15 candidates in their most preferred and least peferred order. Obi and Osinbajo were the most preferred candidates, while Tinubu and Malami were the least preferred candidates.\n\nAnalysis of the survey responses shows that Nigerians are most concerned with the insecurity level in the country. Three out of 10 Nigerians (34.1 percent) indicated that insecurity is the most critical challenge in the country.\n\nWeak economic growth ranked second (22.1 percent), while national disunity ranked third (13.92 percent). Poverty (11.99 percent) and unemployment (10.28) were the other critical development issues.\n\nThe ordering of the developmental challenges remained relatively the same when analyzed from a geopolitical perspective.\n\nRespondents were asked to select the top three attributes (out of a list of ten) they wished to see in their next president. The survey report showed that despite Nigeria\u2019s overt religiosity, \u201cBelieves in God\u201d ranks very low compared to \u201ccompetence,\u201d which is represented on this list by terms such as knowledgeable (17.9 percent), ability to solve problems (17.4 percent), and capable (16.5 percent). Being \u201cyoung\u201d received only 3.2 percent of the responses.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHow much influence do ethnicity and religion have on the choice of presidential candidates in Nigeria? Would Nigerians vote for a president/vice-president ticket that meets all their desirable attributes, but both candidates share the same religion? Or same ethnic origins? On religion, while 5.14 percent of the respondents are emphatic that they would never vote for such a ticket, 58. 7 percent are open to the idea.\n\nSimilarly, on ethnicity, 11.13 percent of the respondents are emphatic that they would never vote for a ticket where the presidential and vice-presidential candidates are from the same ethnic group. However, 43.7 percent of the respondents are open to the idea.\n\nAlmost eight out of ten respondents (76 percent) claimed that \u201cabove all other considerations, I prefer someone who can fix Nigeria irrespective of his or her religion or tribe.\u201d\n\nThis insight signposts a growing desire to have a functional country and citizens\u2019 zeal to thrive and make a difference. It also lends credence to the commonly held belief that if people can meet their daily livelihood needs, they will care less about the ethnic or religious leanings of the president.\n\nIs Nigeria set for a female president, following Liberia and Malawi\u2019s footsteps? The survey responses are in the affirmative, with over 86 percent of respondents stating that they would vote for a competent woman.\n\nThe most gender-progressive regions in Nigeria are the South South and North Central. 93.4 percent of the respondents in the South South would vote for a competent female president, while 97.1 percent would do the same in the North Central region.\n\nThe least progressive regions are the North West with 57.7 percent and the North East with 64.3 percent. It is, however, unclear how this perception would play out at the polls.\n\nNigeria is effectively a two-party state, given the dominance of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nOver 54 percent of the respondents think it is unlikely that the next president will come from a party other than the two dominant ones. If the result is anything to go by, it is evident that either the APC or the PDP will produce the next president of Nigeria.\n\nWhile this is not expected to discourage aspirants on other political platforms, it justifies the focus of Nigerians on the actions and activities of the PDP and the APC.\n\nThis survey is a dip-stick analysis that aims to provide insights into Nigeria\u2019s evolving political space.\n\nGiven the long electoral process leading to the February 2023 elections, one can expect significant changes in perception.\n\nNextier and Data-Tier pledged to continue running the polls and publishing the results until the elections.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to deploy tougher security measures in restive parts of the country to restore situations to normalcy.\n\nSpeaking at the 11th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, he said with the review of operations and strategy, Nigerians can be assure that efforts that resulted in relative peace in South-South, and rescuing of North-East from the hold of terrorists would be ramped up. He said the major challenges have remained in the North Central and North West vowing: \u201cWe are going to be very tough. I will like us to reflect on what the situation was before we came in. How many local government areas were under the control of terrorists in the North-East? In the South-South, we all know what the situation was. Now, we have relative peace. With the resources at our disposal, we have done very well. People are very forgetful. Our main problem now is in the North West and North Central. People are killing one another in these places, what for? We are going to be very tough.\u201d\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe president urged party members to be mindful of the pitfalls that led to the ouster of the PDP in 2015.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThe PDP thought that only time could remove them, and the time actually came. They thought it was impossible to lose elections. We put together a committee with clear terms of reference on how to remove the PDP from power. The PDP thought it wasn\u2019t going to be possible. But it happened.\u2019\n\nBuhari told new members of the National Working Committee (NWC), which had been delegated powers of NEC for a period of 90 days to work towards keeping the party together by creating more room for discussions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to develop differences among ourselves. We have no time for that. I enjoin you all to follow due process in all the party processes and more importantly to develop more mechanisms against corruption. I call on all party members to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to leaders of our party to avoid imposition of candidates that cannot win popular elections. This dictatorial behaviour cost us many strategic seats in the past. In the recent past, this led to some of our strong members unfortunately opting to go elsewhere because of unfairly oppressive behaviour of party leaders at state level. I must caution strongly against any tendency towards developing cliques, infighting within the party.\u201d",

          "title": "Rethink Your Policy on Fuel Subsidy, World Bank Tells Nigeria",
          "text": "\u2022Insists the rich benefit more from fuel subsidy than the poor\n\n\u2022Says barriers distorting country\u2019s trade flows\n\nObinna Chima in Washington DC and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\n\n\nThe President of the World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass has once more reiterated the need for Nigeria\u2019s federal government to reconsider its policy on fuel subsidy, saying that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled to other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass said this yesterday, while responding to a THISDAY question during a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC.\n\nThe Senate last week approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nThe World Bank had last November sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see federal and state governments unable to pay salaries from 2022. The Lead Economist, Nigeria Country office of the World Bank, Marco Antonio Hernandez, had painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria if the country decides to continue with the controversial fuel subsidy.\n\nBut speaking during the media briefing, Malpass pointed out that generalised subsidies have significant negatives effects on any system.\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, the World Bank boss reiterated the need for the country to do away with multiple exchange rate system, which according to him was often, \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there were a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help.\u201d\n\nMalpass noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows, urging the federal government to improve on this so as to help the country and its people move forward.\n\nCommenting on the spate of insecurity in the country, he said: \u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into to none Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stressed the need to boost agricultural productivity in Africa and get farmers to produce more, even as it noted that 20 countries in the region were either in debt distress or very close to debt distress.\n\nSpeaking at the opening press conference of the ongoing World Bank/IMF 2022 spring meetings holding virtually, the Managing Director of the Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said the multilateral institution was working on debt restructuring for the affected countries.\n\nShe stated that the IMF and its partners had agreed on an action plan to address the situation.\n\n\u201cIn Sub Saharan Africa, 20 countries are in bed distress or very close to debt distress, with interest rates going up. This burden of debt is intolerable. So working to get that restructuring currently, this is a priority for us. And this is why I talked about the common framework,\u201d she said.\n\nWhilst noting that the high and rising food prices were of particular concerns, especially in poor countries where there was a growing risk of a food crisis, she said an international action to avoid it was critical.\n\n\u201cFighting inflation through monetary policy tightening raises the costs of servicing debt. For low-income countries, its burden has reached 50 percent of GDP, placing 60 per cent of these counties at or near debt distress,\u201d the IMF boss added.\n\nShe noted: \u201cTo address debt, countries need domestic policies that can help bring their budgets back on track, while providing targeted assistance to the most vulnerable. They can help finance this with more equitable tax policies.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, she said the ongoing Ukraine war had resulted to spike in global inflation as well as insecurity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Ayu to Amaechi: We don\u2019t want president that can run round stadium like Usain Bolt, but can\u2019t run railway transportation\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nAt the close of the submission of completed presidential nomination forms of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, 17 presidential aspirants were listed for further screening ahead of the party\u2019s primary elections.\n\nThe aspirants, who beat the deadline, were two-term governor of Kwara State and immediate past President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki; former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Speaker, House of Representatives, and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; former President of the Senate and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nOthers included former Minister of Federal Capital Territory and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; former Minister of State for Education and Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; outgoing Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel; 2019 PDP vice presidential candidate and former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi; former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose; United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; and media mogul, Dele Momodu.\n\nAlso successful were Investment banker and economist, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa; former Speaker of Abia State House of Assembly, Cosmos Ndukwe; Charles Ugwu; as well as the only female aspirant in the race, Tareila Diana.\n\nThe party realised N640 million from the 16 male presidential aspirants and N6 million from the only female presidential aspirant, Diana, making the revenue generated N646 million.\n\nNational Organising Secretary of PDP, Bature Umar, in a statement, said the screening of presidential aspirants would commence April 27, while the governorship aspirants would be screened on April 26.\n\nUmar also said the House of Representatives, senatorial, and House of Assembly aspirants would be screened on April 25, while appeals by those dissatisfied with the screening exercise would commence on April 25 for House of Assembly, while that for House of Representatives and Senate would take place on April 27.\n\nAppeals from governorship aspirants would be addressed on April 29, and the presidential appeal committee would hear appeals from dissatisfied presidential aspirants on April 30, the statement said.\n\nIt said the process of selection of ad hoc delegates for the election of candidates would commence April 23, to be followed by ward congress on April 26.\n\nIn the revised timetable, local government congresses would take place nationwide on April 29, while the local government appeal committees would hear appeals from the election of the ad hoc delegates on May 2.\n\nDelegates\u2019 list would be published on May 5, while the nomination congress of the House of Representatives and Senate would take place May 12 and May 14, respectively.\n\nThe appeals would take place on May 18, while the governorship primaries would be held on May 24, with the appeals following on May 25. The presidential convention of PDP is expected to hold on May 29 and 30.\n\nYesterday, also, the Akwa Ibom State governor addressed the party\u2019s NWC on his presidential aspiration, likening the 2023 presidential election to a war, and required an experienced politician to carry the APC presidential ticket.\n\nEmmanuel stated, \u201cJust to let the party know that we are challenged as a nation. The party is about going to war. And if you want to go to war, you cannot leave your generals and start dealing with recruits.\n\n\u201cYou have the generals in your team and we\u2019re ready to march on to victory. And I\u2019m trying to let you know that if you will look around the country today, there are issues in Nigeria, so people want to see those that will bring solutions and not create more problems.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigeria was challenged, \u201cBecause this is a country that you\u2019d woke up one morning, if care is not taken, you wouldn\u2019t have stories to tell our children. You come into the scene, you play the politics, with all your knowledge, with all your experience, with all the education, with all your exposure, how come you didn\u2019t try, you didn\u2019t even offer to serve your country?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be questioned like that in the next generation. So, today, I\u2019m standing as one of those that have solution to economic issues. So, the solution for Nigeria, first of all, is to try and rescue our economic values in this country. I don\u2019t want to go so much about the infrastructure, because that one, once you can rescue, with that you can actually reconstruct and restore the infrastructure that has decayed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday took a swipe at Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, a presidential aspirant on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), for his alleged inability to manage the railway system in the country. Speaking after Emmanuel had briefed the party on his presidential aspiration, Ayu said Nigeria desired trusted and tested politicians, like the Akwa Ibom State governor, to manage the affairs of the country.\n\nAyu stated, in a veiled reference to Amaechi, \u201cWe don\u2019t want presidential aspirants, who can run round the stadium, like Usain Bolt, but cannot run a railway station.\u201d\n\nHe compared the presidential aspirants of the party to those of APC, saying all of them are qualified to run the affairs of the country better than President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAyu advised the PDP presidential aspirants to take their campaigns to the delegates, as their votes would decide the 2023 presidential candidate of the party. He also warned against mudslinging during electioneering campaigns, saying such would give the opposition ammunition to attack the party.\n\n\u201cCampaigns would be issue-based and not attacking each other or mudslinging,\u201d the PDP national chairman said. He pledged that the party would conduct a transparent and fair presidential convention, as it had no preferred candidate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country.\u201d\n\nChairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi,however, commended President Buhari for demonstrating resilience and determination at a crucial period in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader, who is not distracted by momentary challenges but has continued to commit to the renewal of our nation and we, governors, ministers and heads of government agencies are equally dedicated to building a better Nigeria, on your watch,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that this year\u2019s Holy month of Ramadan coincided with the just concluded Christian Lenten period, the Governor of Ekiti, said it held enormous spiritual value on the benefits of renewal, sacrifice, almsgiving, forgiveness and healing for the individual as well as the nation.\n\nOn his part, Diri, who spoke when he received the Comptroller of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Bayelsa Command, Mr Sunday James, the Bayelsa helmsman lamented the level of insecurity in the north, saying once a part of the country was in distress, other areas were also affected.\n\nHe said the spate of killings by terrorists in the country was a great setback for Nigeria, where lives could be taken at will and urged the APC-led federal government to effectively curb the killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cI use this opportunity to again call on the federal government to do something. These are the same issues that led to the APC government coming to power in 2015.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you will agree that things are worse now than in 2015. The federal government has to redouble its effort, otherwise, the joker card is with the people of Nigeria. They know what to do come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen one part of the country is sick, it affects the other parts. Kaduna and other states in the North are sick security-wise and it is affecting other parts of the country. Nigeria is very close to the Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u2018state of nature\u2019 where life is described as nasty, brutish and short. The federal government has to do something to keep us away from the Hobbesian state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, James, said the visit was to formally present himself as the new helmsman of the service in the state, and said as the agency in charge of giving clearance to intending foreign visitors, he was prepared to synergise to realise the state\u2019s investment drive.\n\nDiri equally charged the new Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral Idi Abbas, to collaborate with the state government in curbing oil theft, illegal bunkering, kidnapping and related crimes in the maritime domain of the state.\n\nHe acknowledged that having served in the Command in other capacities, Rear Admiral Abbas, would contribute significantly towards sustaining the peace and development of the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe you have distinguished and excelled in your service and will not be a pawn in the chess game of anybody or any political party.\n\n\u201cEnsure that you discharge your functions with utmost professionalism to bring about peace, security and development of Bayelsa and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cSecurity does not know ethnicity. It has no face of political parties and so, let nobody influence you and your Command on politics. We are in a political season and all kinds of characters are on display: the good, the bad and the ugly. The number one thing is to ensure safety of lives and property in our maritime domain and that is the only way we can talk about genuine development.\u201d\n\nAbbas, on his part, also said his visit was to officially present himself to the governor following his posting to head the Command on February 4 this year.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the state government for its support to the Command and appreciated it for the donation of land to build a referral hospital, adding that the secondary school allocated to the Navy would be taken over completely in no distant time.\n\nIn a related development, Diri was decorated as an ambassador against drug abuse by the state command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nThe NDLEA State Commandant, Commander Aminu Ali, conferred the honour on the governor when he led other members of the agency to formally introduce himself as the new head of the command.\n\nTerrorists Kill Three Kidnapped Victims in Kaduna, Threaten to Kill 22 Others over N20m Ransom\n\nSome terrorists operating in Kaduna State had killed three of their victims in the state, and threatened to kill 22 others if a ransom of N20 million was not delivered to them before midnight yesterday.\n\nThe victims were abducted at about 8pm on March 31, 2022, in Anguwan Bulus, a suburb near Sabon Tasha GRA in Kaduna city.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, who visited the community yesterday, the Village Head, Mr. Gideon Goni, said the terrorists called the community on telephone to inform them that three of the victims had been killed and threatened to kill the remaining 22 if by midnight yesterday N20 million ransom was not paid.\n\nHe said on March 31, 2022, the terrorists invaded the community around 8pm, killed two people and abducted 26 others, adding that one person was later released on health ground.\n\nHe said the terrorists gave them a description of a location along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, to pick the corpses of the three persons killed.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists called and said they had killed three of the 25 people being held in captivity and that if we don\u2019t pay N20 million ransom before 12pm on Tuesday (April 19, 2022), others would be killed,\u201d Goni said.\n\nAccording to him, the community was raising some money to secure the release of the victims \u201cwhen the terrorists called us and told us to pick the corpses of three of their victims at Dutse.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to them not to kill anyone. We are appealing to the state and federal governments as well as religious bodies to come to our rescue so that the killings will stop,\u201d Goni said.\n\nOne of those whose family member were kidnapped, said he had been able to raise N7 million, \u201cbut the terrorists insisted on the N20 million or they will keep killing the victims.\u201d\n\nMohammed Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command did not respond to telephone calls, when contacted.\n\nThree Dead, 19 Injured As Explosion Rocks Taraba Cattle Market\n\nThree people were yesterday killed while 19 others sustained varying degrees of injuries, when an explosions rocked Iware Cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nThe incident, which occurred around 4pm at a local drinking spot, sent the entire community in pandemonium as people ran helter-skelter for safety.\n\nThe State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview.\n\nA resident of Iware, Ismael Yakubu, also told THISDAY that the bomber came into the spot in company of another accomplice with the bomb hidden in a polythene bag and disguised as customers.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTwo guys came to the drinking spot as if they wanted to buy Burukutu and after they were served, the one holding the poly bag containing the bomb dropped his beer and the polythene bag and left.\n\n\u201cThe accomplice then said he was going to look for his friend and would come back. After he had also left, the bomb exploded and many people were injured while some others were killed.\u201d\n\nOne of the bombers was, however, apprehended and was killed by the angry mob before security operatives could arrive the scene.\n\nThe corpses of those killed had been deposited at the mortuary while those injured were receiving treatment at a health facility in Iware. Others in critical conditions had equally been moved to the Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo.\n\nIware cattle market is one of the biggest cattle markets in Taraba State and the economic hub of Ardo Kola Local Government Area, which operates every Tuesday.\n\nIG Orders Maximum Security in Schools, Colleges; Hard on Compliance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, yesterday, ordered the review of police personnel and operational assets deployments to schools and colleges around the country.\n\nThe review may not be unconnected with the incessant kidnapping of school children by bandits in the North and the killing of school pupils in isolated incidents, owing to inadequate security by the affected schools in the Southern part of the country.\n\nLagos State government had yesterday shut Chrisland School over alleged sex scandal involving a 10-year-old female pupil during a trip to Dubai.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters said the review was to ensure the protection of schools and colleges, particularly, boarding schools, tertiary institutions and its campuses in areas prone to security breaches around the country.\n\nThe statement said the IG directive was issued at a meeting of the force management team at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, while reviewing the general security in the country including the security of schools and colleges as a result of some isolated incidences reported in some schools.\n\nThe IG slso directed all Commissioners of Police in the 36 States and FCT, tactical commanders as well as their supervising Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) to explore all available options and think outside the box to boost security in and around schools, colleges and student-based communities.\n\nThe IG, therefore, directed detectives/operatives of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) and the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) to ensure sustained surveillance and intelligence gathering activities within various school environments while the Police Airwing was directed to extend its aerial patrols to the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThe IG, however, assured the people that all hands would be on deck to ensure a safe environment for all pupils and students in the various schools and colleges in the country, even as he reiterated the commitment of his administration to diversifying resources towards sustainable security and safety of the citizenry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nobel laureate: This is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry\n\n\u2022Falana laments disparity in justice system, says influential politicians getting away with corruption\n\nGoddy Egene, Wale Igbintade in Lagos and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\n\n\nNobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, yesterday joined the growing number of eminent Nigerians and groups that have condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant a presidential pardon to former governors, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame. Soyinka said the pardon showed that the Buhari administration\u2019s anti-corruption fight was over.\n\nEchoing the words of Jesus Christ before he breathed his last, Soyinka said regarding the president\u2019s anti-graft effort, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d signifying the end of his mission.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) yesterday condemned the presidential pardon granted to the two former governors convicted for corruption.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, denounced the disparity in the sentencing of rich and poor convicts in Nigeria, stressing that the justice system is often manipulated to favour influential politicians facing corruption charges.\n\nSoyinka, in a statement, likened the state pardon given to the former governors to an egg smashed against the faces of Nigerians, saying it would take a long time to wiped it off.\n\nThe former governor of Plateau State, Dariye, and erstwhile Taraba State governor, Nyame, were serving jail terms for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, while they were in office.\n\nBut to the surprise and disappointment of many Nigerians, the National Council of State last week approved that Dariye, Nyame, and 157 others serving jail terms be pardoned following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, as approved by Buhari.\n\nMixed reactions greeted the decision, with many condemning it.\n\nHuman rights organisation, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), specifically asked Buhari to urgently withdraw the pardon.\n\nReacting to the pardon, in a message titled, \u201cA Putrid Presidential Easter Egg,\u201d Soyinka said he aligned with Bishop Matthew Kukah, in his Easter message, where the cleric lambasted Buhari.\n\nSoyinka said, \u201cComing from a leader who had placed all his eggs in one basket, labelled Anti-corruption, this is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\n\n\u201cIt evokes the legend of Pandora\u2019s box whose contents are alleged to constitute all the ills that plague the world.\n\n\u201cPutrid to the core, allied to power provocations in numerous variations, such as catapulting a notorious player in the martyrdom of a serving Minister of Justice to the hub of governance wheel, these define the nature of bequests that have brought the nation to this moment of near dissolution. Precedents are no consolation, no excuses.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added, \u201cOne states the obvious in remarking that precedents either undermine or reinforce principles, and aspiring offenders, especially in the political domain, are encouraged or inhibited by the ease or difficulty of access to the fount of mercy.\n\n\u201cOffice holders, we presume, are constrained by the existence of that dangling Sword of Damocles \u2013 simply knowing that one day, the cloak of immunity will turn threadbare, and the awaited day of reckoning finds them answerable. Clearly, not any longer.\n\n\u201cYou will forgive, though disagree with me, I know, for clambering onto the Easter wagon myself, to echo the words of the One whose passage through the world the Easter season commemorates: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Kukah\u2019s homily, the Nobel Laureate said he was impelled not to miss an opportunity to add his own Easter drop \u201cto the overflowing vessel of pietistic sentiments, if only to reassure Christians \u2013 and also Muslims in turn \u2013 that even \u2018we, non-believers, do partake of that same ethical communion to which most humanities aspire.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, your Easter sermon opens up yet again those sluices of juridical hypocrisy to which we dare not cease to draw attention. Such, in the immediate, remains the plight of two young men \u2013 Mubarak Bala and the musician Yahaya Sharif \u2013 one serving a sentence of twenty-five years, the other actually sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018blasphemy\u2019 comes into its authentic mode, in my view, whenever anyone violates a solemn oath of office. It penitentially becomes even redoubled when such violators are pampered with the prerogative of mercy.\n\n\u201cPermit me to call special attention to the following from your (Kukah) sermon: \u2018Religious leaders\u2026. must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam.\n\n\u201c\u2019While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that he was persuaded that the recent largesse from the president had already won a few hearts and minds to the ranks, \u201cif not of outright atheism, then at least to a healthy sceptical regard of piety spouting leadership that saw nothing wrong in attempts to extinguish the life of a young man for an honest declaration of conviction, while veterans of broken pledges were let loose to further infect a world they had betrayed.\n\n\u201cNo pardon has been extended in the direction of endangered, youthful integrity. Of course, it is easy to track the trajectory of events.\n\n\u201cNettled by increasingly scabrous comments, such as those of his predecessor in office, Olusegun Obasanjo, who declared that this incumbent has run out of ideas, that he has nothing left to offer the nation, Muhammad Buhari decided to embark on the Easter train and donate an Easter egg of truly presidential proportions to his subjects.\u201d\n\nFalana Condemns Disparity in Justice System, Says Influential Politicians Getting Away with Corruption\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Inaugural Public Lecture of Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Oyo State, Falana stated that some personalities in the society seemed to be \u201cuntouchable, since they have the money, they can influence and manipulate the justice system in their favour.\u201d\n\nIn his paper titled, \u201cSentencing Rich and Poor Convicts In Nigeria: An Unbalanced Scale,\u201d Falana identified the dysfunctional justice system operated by Nigerian courts as the main problem with the justice system.\n\nHe said, \u201cOwing to the class character of the society, the courts and law enforcement agencies tend to favour rich convicts against poor convicts. This problem has caused the public to lose hope and trust in the country\u2019s judicial system.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer stated that drastic \u201csteps must be taken to address the issue of disparity in sentencing, to ensure justice, fairness, and equality before the law, for all convicts.\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, some influential Nigerians commit crimes and get away with it, owing to corruption and the abysmally compromised system.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome persons convicted and sentenced and jailed were never found in any correctional centre while unemployed young people serve prison terms in lieu of rich convicts.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cJudges could even be coerced into favouring those rich offenders against their own will. But there is often no one to speak for the poor, who often have no voice of their own. On the few occasions that the rich are convicted, they are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors.\n\n\u201cCorruption: this is also one of the major issues affecting the fair administration of justice in Nigeria. Oftentimes, rich defendants engage in dilatory tactics, which frustrate and compel the state to enter into plea bargain with them.\n\n\u201cJudges award lighter sentences to convicted rich defendants or resort to technicalities to free them. Otherwise, how could someone that embezzled pension funds worth billions of Naira be sentenced to only six months imprisonment, but another who stole a cheap telephone handset be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment?\n\n\u201cInjustice: there is also obvious injustice against the poor. More attention is being paid to cases involving the rich, as opposed to the poor.\n\n\u201cI will highlight a few cases to illustrate my point. First, is the case of Tafa Balogun, the former Inspector General of Police. After his arrest and arraignment by EFCC for corruptly enriching himself to the tune of N17 billion, Tafa Balogun went to court challenging the powers of the EFCC to prosecute him. He later withdrew the case from court and the EFCC\u2019s case against him was eventually decided when he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly a case of plea bargaining, as the withdrawal of his case from court led to the negotiation by which his punishment was reduced to six months imprisonment after forfeiting some of his loots to the government.\n\n\u201cAnother incident of plea bargaining was the case of former Governor of Bayelsa State, Dieprieye Alamiesiegha. He, too, was arrested and taken to court by the EFCC, who, after entering into negotiation with the accused, reduced the charges against him to six. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment while he refunded some amount of money into the government coffers.\n\n\u201cSimilar thing happened in the case of Lucky Igbinedon, the former Governor of Edo State, who was fined the sum of N3.5 million after he had entered into a plea bargain with EFCC to reduce the 191-count charge against him to just a single count. Though Igbinedion walked away a free man in Nigeria, he was effectively barred by the United States Government on January 12, 2013 from entering its territory henceforth.\n\n\u201cIn the case of John Yusuf, who embezzled N27.2 billion pension fund of retired police officers, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment or a fine of N750,000.00 that being the maximum punishment provided for in Section 309 of the Penal Code under which he was charged!\n\n\u201cMrs. Cecilia Ibru, the former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Oceanic Bank Plc. Mrs. Ibru was arraigned before the court by the EFCC on a 25-count charge of different charges of corruption while in office. After negotiation with the anti-corruption body, the charges against her were reduced to three.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the plea bargaining between the EFCC and Mrs. Ibru, the accused decided to plead guilty to the reduced charges of mismanagement and abuse of office. Thereafter, Kola Awodein, (SAN), who appeared for the EFCC, subsequently informed the court that the commission had reached an agreement with Mrs. Ibru and the said agreement had been filed in court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria added, \u201cOn Friday, the 8th day of October, 2010, the trial judge, Justice Dan Abutu of the Federal High Court, Lagos, delivered judegment in the matter. He sentenced the accused to six months imprisonment on each of the three counts and directed that the sentences should run concurrently. This means the convict was to spend only six months in prison.\n\n\u201cThe convict, however, forfeited N191 billion worth of properties and assets to the government, according to the judgement of the court. Among the properties so forfeited were those in Nigeria, United States of America and Dubai in United Arab Emirates, together with shares in more than 100 companies, most of them listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe judge ordered Mrs. Ibru to be taken to Reddington Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos by the prison authorities within two hours after they receive the copy of the judgement and she is to remain in the hospital until she is certified fit to stay in prison custody.\n\n\u201cThe case of FRN v. Sarah Ochepke & 2 Ors , where the Defendant along with two other accused persons were by an Amended Charge dated 9th of February, 2018 arraigned before the Federal High Court, Jos, on three counts charge of conspiracy, to accept cash payment of the sum of N450,000,000 from one Annet Olije Gyen, Head of operations, Jos branch of Fidelity Bank Plc, and did accept and retain the said amount of N450,000,000.00, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law to be paid to an individual(s).\n\n\u201cThe court sentenced the defendants Sarah Ochepke (being the former Minister of Water Resources), Raymond Dabo, and Leo Jitung, to three months imprisonment each, with an option to pay a fine of N1 million each. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 16(1) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2013 (as amended), carries a minimum term of three years imprisonment or a N10 million fine. The judge, however, exercised his discretion and sentenced them to three months imprisonment each or an option N1 million naira each.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Falana said, \u201cThe case of FRN v. Abdulrasheed Maina is one of the few that made a little difference: Maina who was charged with criminal offences, punishable under sections 11(2) (a), 15(3), and 16(2) (c) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, and also acted in breach of the Advance Fee Fraud Act, was in November, 2021, convicted and sentenced to eight years imprisonment, after being found guilty on all the 12-count charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him and his company, Common Input Property and Investment Limited.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered Maina and his firm to forfeit about N2.1 billion that was traced to their bank accounts, as well as another sum of $223, 396, 30, to the federal government, after which he directed that the company should be wound up. It also ordered the forfeiture of Maina\u2019s two choice properties at Life camp and Jabi districts of Abuja, to the government, likewise the auction of a bulletproof car and a BMW 5 Series exotic car that was found in premises of the convict.\n\n\u201cOn March 18, 2022, an Abuja Upper Area Court in the Gwagwalada area council sentenced a 19-year-old student, Hillary Yunana, to four-month imprisonment for stealing spaghetti and noodles from a shop. The convict, a resident of Bassa village, along Airport Road, Abuja, was charged with burglary and theft.\n\n\u201cThe judge, Sani Umar, jailed Yunana after he pleaded guilty to the offence. Umar, however, gave the convict an option to pay N10,000 for each of the charges, or serve a jail term of two months for each of them. He said the sentence would run concurrently and warned Yunana to desist from committing crimes in the future. The judge said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to anyone who wanted to toe the depraved path in the future.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, 2022, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, discharged and acquitted the former Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Andrew Yakubu, of the money laundering charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him.\n\n\u201cThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, held that the anti-graft agency failed to prove its case against the erstwhile NNPC boss. The court ordered that monies the EFCC seized from Yakubu, who was GMD of the NNPC between 2012 and 2014, should be returned to him.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC had on the strength of a tip-off by a whistle-blower, raided Yakubu\u2019s guest house situated at Sabon Tasha, Kaduna State in 2017 and discovered the sum of $9.7million and \u00a374,000 which he hid in a fireproof safe inside the house.\u201d\n\nFalana explained further, \u201cBetween 2005 and 2006, a panel of enquiry instituted by the federal government found that 197 defendants who were tried, convicted and jailed for drug trafficking were not found in any correctional centre in the country.\n\n\u201cAt the end of their trials, members of a syndicate made of prosecution and defence lawyers, court clerks and warders collected heavy bribes from the convicts and allowed them to escape imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was found that the convicts returned to the nefarious business. I took up the matter with the authorities of the NDLEA, who assured me that the convicts would be arrested and made to serve the prison terms. But that was the end of the story.\n\n\u201cOn July 10, 2015, the then Chief Judge of Anambra State, the Honourable Justice Umeadi, visited all prisons in the state for the purpose of jail delivery to decongest the prisons. His Lordship disclosed that some prison inmates have no records in the prisons. The scandal was well reported at the material time.\n\n\u201cSince inmates are committed to prisons by warrants issued by Judges and Magistrates, the authorities of the correctional centre are challenged to explain who authorised the \u2018imprisonment\u2019 of inmates without records.\n\n\u201cAwaiting trial inmates constitute not less than 75 per cent of the prison population in the country. Majority of the inmates, including convicts, are poor people. The few rich people and members of the ruling class that are jailed are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors in exercise of their powers under section 175 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBased on the recommendation of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Council of State has just approved the pardon of a number of convicted persons, including two former state governors that were jailed for laundering billions of naira.\n\n\u201cSince the constitution provides for equality of all citizens before the law, all other persons convicted for stealing, fraud and money laundering ought to be pardoned and freed. There can be no moral or legal justification for jailing poor people who steal spaghetti and noodles to feed their family members while those who loot the treasury are granted clemency or pardon.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, permit me to call on the poor who constitute the majority of poor victims of institutionalised criminal justice system to unite and fight for socioeconomic justice and equality before the law.\n\n\u201cIn particular, indigent accused persons are advised to brief lawyers in the Legal Aid Council and the Office of the Public Defender in every state of the federation to provide them with legal practitioner whenever they are arrested, detained or charged with any criminal offence.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the state to assign lawyers, free of charge, to citizens who earn less than the national minimum wage of N30,000.00.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law is not neutral in a class society. It is made and enacted by rich legislators to serve the interests of the rich. The judges interpret the law to favour the rich and powerful people in the society.\n\n\u201cThe big lawyers hired to defend the rich exploit loopholes and technicalities in the law to free their rich clients. Hence, the poor man who stole noodle in Abuja to feed himself, was jailed by an Upper Area Court. Even though he had no more to feed himself, the judge sentenced him to six months imprisonment or N20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cBut the former top public officer who laundered $9.8 million and \u00a374,000, has been set free by the Federal High Court. The judge blamed the EFCC for not proving the case beyond reasonable doubt!\u201d\n\nPyrates Confraternity Condemns Pardon to Nyame, Dariye\n\nThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) declared that Nyame and Dariye were undeserving of the presidential pardon.\n\nThe group said the pardon had made mockery of the anti-graft law, stressing that it is manifestly undeserving, blatantly discriminatory and distasteful.\n\nFurthermore, it said the Council of State let the nation down by not rejecting the recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy to the former governors, adding that the pardon has effectively killed the anti-graft war.\n\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr. Abiola Owoaje, in a statement titled, \u201cPresidential Pardon for Corrupt Ex-governors: Buhari\u2019s death knell for the anti-graft war,\u201d and made available to THISDAY in Yenagoa, said the intention of presidential pardon ought not to be for the likes of Nyame and Dariye.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) is extremely disappointed by the unfortunate decision of the Council of State. We are saddened that the Council, which courageously, reportedly, turned down a state pardon for former Bank PHB Managing Director, Francis Atuche, also serving jail term for corruption, could not display the same courage and reject the request to pardon Nyame and Dariye.\n\n\u201cWhatever the rationale behind acquiescing to the recommendation of the committee to pardon the two corrupt former governors before serving out their prison terms, the nation has been let down by this eminent body.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the pardon had lent justifiable credence to speculations that its intention was to shore up the battered image of the ruling party and give it a bounce ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nOwoaje pointed out that the presidential pardon was inconsistent with Sections 15(5), 17(a) and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. He added that it \u201calso miserably falls below standards, measures and rules in the United Nations Convention against corruption.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that corruption in the country predated the Buhari administration, adding, however, \u201chis numerous assurances that he would fight and defeat corruption was one of the key reasons Nigerians elected him in 2015 and re-elected him in 2019.\n\n\u201cSeven years down the line, Nigerians are still bearing with the oft repeated refrain that \u2018we must kill corruption before it kills us\u2019 as the only tangible reference to demonstrate the president\u2019s acclaimed commitment to tackle corruption.\n\n\u201cWell-meaning Nigerians had hoped that President Buhari would be able to summon the courage and salvage his administration\u2019s tepid anti-graft war. Sadly, the presidential pardon has made mockery of the war against corruption. Unequivocally, the grim implication of the presidential pardon, aside the demoralising effect it would have on anti-graft officials, is the fact that it has effectively sabotaged the war against graft.\n\n\u201cIt certainly would embolden our well- heeled citizens to engage in corruption with the belief that they can be granted pardon by their friends in government. We have previously recommended to the government steps to take to tackle corruption but the administration\u2019s latest action has shown that it is not willing to lift a finger to fight corruption. In granting state pardon to corrupt individuals, President Buhari has conferred on himself the status of the Chief Undertaker that sounded the death knell for his administrations\u2019 anti-graft war.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The committee, which also sat and clinically deliberated on this same matter, recommended appropriate disciplinary actions against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi to the university management.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the university administration would have to present its recommendations to the governing council which has the final say on the matter, considering the status of the staff involved.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first lecturer to be dismissed from the school was from the Department of Management and Accounting, and the second was from the Department of English Language.\n\n\n\nThe third, who was dismissed in March 2022, was from the Department of International Relations.\n\nVictim\u2019s Account\n\n\n\nBababunmi, in her account, said she was \u201cviolated\u201d by the professor.\n\n\n\nShe said Opefeyitimi sexually molested her during a visit to his office on March 18, 2022.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Department of Linguistics & African Languages, OAU, titled, \u2018Report of Sexual Assault and Molestation Against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi,\u2019 she said the professor invited her to his office and as she was leaving, he grabbed her from behind and asked her to be his lover.\n\nThe female student said the professor continued to grope her after which he exposed his already erect penis which he forced into her hand.\n\n\n\nShe said the professor pleaded with her to give him a \u2018hand-job\u2019 and despite her pleas to be left alone, the professor pulled her to himself, rubbing his penis on her buttocks.\n\n\n\nThe aggrieved student said she was so petrified and traumatised all through the period of the incident as she called for justice. She said the Professor is the lecturer-in-charge of one of the courses she's enrolled in and might fail her.\n\n\n\nShe wrote, \u201cMy name is XXX with matric no. XXX. I am writing to inform you about the unpleasant experience I had with one of my lecturers in the person of Prof. Opefeyitimi on Friday, 18th of March, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe sent me a WhatsApp message on Thursday, 17th asking me to see him in his office the following day between 8 am and 2 pm. As a lecturer who I respected so much, I obliged and never questioned his order.\n\n\n\n\u201cI got to his office around 1: 23 pm. He told me that he only wanted to ask about what was going on on the campus since he wasn\u2019t on campus the previous day.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was astounded to hear that but I told him to take the Road 7 route when ready to go home because Road 1 was blocked.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe asked me to sit down and he asked me the reason why the road was blocked then I told him that I didn\u2019t really know and heard that it was all about the appointment of the new VC.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe decided to leave the office immediately and he packed his things, saying that I was a godsend to him because it was almost 2 pm and he needed to pick up his son from school.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe carried the bag and as we were about to leave the office, I offered to help him with the bag but he declined and I headed for the door.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe grabbed me from behind and held me so tight. At this point I was in shock, then he said and I quote \u201cMo f\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ed \u00e8mi \u00e0ti \u1eb9 j\u1ecd w\u00e0 pap\u1ecd\u0300 ni [thrice] but problem t\u00ed mo n\u00ed t\u1eb9\u0301l\u1eb9\u0300 ni boy XXX y\u1eb9n but mi \u00f2 r\u00f2 p\u00e9 \u00f3 y\u1eb9 k\u00f3 j\u1eb9\u0301 problem m\u1ecd\u0301\u201d meaning \u2018I want us to be together, the problem was that boy (name withheld) but I don't think that should be a problem any longer\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt this point, he had already dropped the big bag he was carrying and he held me with his other hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe made me sit on his lap and was groping me, he then said again \u201cMi \u00f2 m\u1ecd b\u00ed a \u1e63e f\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63e \u00e9 t\u00ed o fi m\u00e1a graduate p\u1eb9\u0300l\u00fa 2:1 k\u00ed o l\u00e8 pad\u00e0 w\u00e1 \u1e63e master\u2019s\u201d (I don't know how to ensure you graduate with a 2:1 so you can come back to this school for master\u2019s degree).\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I told him that he should let me go and that I will come back to see him some other day just to free myself of him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t answer me when I said that but he stood up from the chair still forcefully holding me and dragged me to the couch in his office.\n\n\n\n\"By this time, he had already pulled down his trousers, (and) brought out his erect penis. He grabbed my right hand and used it to rub his sexual penis. It happened so quickly that I was petrified.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe continued to rub his penis and I was so distressed by the entire situation that I lost count of time. In order to appeal to him to release his hold on me, I then told him that I needed to leave his office immediately because I was already taking too long and someone was patiently waiting for me downstairs.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut he replied me and said \u2018Gbogbo time t\u00ed mo n\u00ed p\u1eb9\u0300l\u00fa \u1eb9 b\u00e1y\u00ec\u00ed k\u00f2 ju 5mins l\u1ecd, j\u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0301 b\u00e1 mi \u1e63e \u00e9 mo k\u00e0n f\u1eb9\u0301 come ni (I won't stay longer than 5 minutes, please do it, I just want to come); I won\u2019t touch you today please because I didn\u2019t inform you before.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cI begged him that I was not comfortable at all that he should please let me go, but he didn\u2019t listen to me. He laid down on his couch and was using my hand to stroke his penis.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt some point, he stood up, dragged me to his table, turned my back to him and was rubbing his manhood on me. At this point, all my pleas to him to please release me fell on deaf ears.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe pinned me there against the table, rubbing his penis on my back, repeating over and over again, \u201cO \u1e63e \u00e9, O \u1e63e \u00e9\u201d (thank you).\n\n\n\n\u201cTaking advantage of my vulnerability because he is physically stronger than me, he sexually assaulted, molested, and violated me.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe used both his physical strength and high office and power as a professor in the Department of African Languages and Literatures to sexually impose himself on me, despite my pleas to him that I did not want his violent actions and forced attack on me.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor how long he was doing this to me, I could not tell because my heart was beating so fast out of fear, and I was drenched in sweat from a panic attack.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen he finally freed me, he asked me if I would see him 8 am on Monday and I said \u2018No\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe asked me why? Out of fear for my life and safety, I told him that it was because my place was far. I was trying hard to say whatever would make him release me. I had never been so terrified as I was that day in his office.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe asked me where my place was. And I told him that I live at Aba Iya Gani. He then offered to come and pick me (up) but I declined, after which he asked me if I knew Olatoke Hotel at Opa. I said I did not know the place and he said that was no problem; that anytime I\u2019m free to come on Monday, nobody will disturb him and then he gave me a thousand naira (N1,000) for transportation.\n\n\n\n\u201cI collected the money because I believed he wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to go if I didn\u2019t collect it from him. When we finally left the office, he sent me a message on WhatsApp thanking me and he asked if I would be on campus by 10 am on Monday and I told him that I didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen he said, \u2018Okay, hope you are not traveling?\u2019 And I didn\u2019t reply him till now. The entire situation has left me feeling so traumatized. This is an obvious abuse of power in which my faith in someone who has been a teacher and mentor, someone that I look up to and had maximum respect for since the very day I entered this University, has been exploited.\n\n\n\n\u201cProfessor Opefeyitimi teaches a class that I currently take, and he has the power to fail me or give me any grade that he pleases. In addition, I took another class with him, and he has not yet released the grade for that class.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy career depends on the grades he gives me. I believe his failure to fully penetrate me in his office frustrated him, and I was lucky that I wore tight trousers that he was unable to yank down.\n\n\n\n\u201cI remain grateful to God that I was not wearing a dress or a skirt that day, otherwise, he would have succeeded in penetrating me, while rubbing his penis on my buttocks.\n\n\n\n\u201cSir, I am writing this message to call your attention to this defiling act and wrongful use of his professorial power and influence.\n\n\n\n\u201cI ask that justice be served and to ensure that he does not further harm me physically or in any other way: including removing from my grades; shaming me during classes and learning activities, because I did not cooperate during his molestation, assault and molestation that fateful day in his office, which will never be erased from my memory.\n\n\u201cI expect that Prof. Opefeyitimi is brought to justice. His action was so quick and immediate that I believe I am not his first victim.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe seemed to have practised this assault before because he seemed to know exactly what to say and what to do, as I looked stupefied before him, and he kept manipulating my body and using his genitalia as a weapon of assault.\n\n\n\n\u201cI look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.\"\n\nIn a letter addressed to the school\u2019s vice-chancellor, Prof. Tope Ogunbodede, Opefeyitimi denied the allegation of sexual assault, saying the female student was his fianc\u00e9e and that \u2018all that happened in my office was consensual\u2019.",

The committee, which also sat and clinically deliberated on this same matter, recommended appropriate disciplinary actions against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi to the university management.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the university administration would have to present its recommendations to the governing council which has the final say on the matter, considering the status of the staff involved.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe first lecturer to be dismissed from the school was from the Department of Management and Accounting, and the second was from the Department of English Language.\n\n\n\nThe third, who was dismissed in March 2022, was from the Department of International Relations.\n\nVictim\u2019s Account\n\n\n\nBababunmi, in her account, said she was \u201cviolated\u201d by the professor.\n\n\n\nShe said Opefeyitimi sexually molested her during a visit to his office on March 18, 2022.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Department of Linguistics & African Languages, OAU, titled, \u2018Report of Sexual Assault and Molestation Against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi,\u2019 she said the professor invited her to his office and as she was leaving, he grabbed her from behind and asked her to be his lover.\n\nThe female student said the professor continued to grope her after which he exposed his already erect penis which he forced into her hand.\n\n\n\nShe said the professor pleaded with her to give him a \u2018hand-job\u2019 and despite her pleas to be left alone, the professor pulled her to himself, rubbing his penis on her buttocks.\n\n\n\nThe aggrieved student said she was so petrified and traumatised all through the period of the incident as she called for justice. She said the Professor is the lecturer-in-charge of one of the courses she's enrolled in and might fail her.\n\n\n\nShe wrote, \u201cMy name is XXX with matric no. XXX. I am writing to inform you about the unpleasant experience I had with one of my lecturers in the person of Prof. Opefeyitimi on Friday, 18th of March, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe sent me a WhatsApp message on Thursday, 17th asking me to see him in his office the following day between 8 am and 2 pm. As a lecturer who I respected so much, I obliged and never questioned his order.\n\n\n\n\u201cI got to his office around 1: 23 pm. He told me that he only wanted to ask about what was going on on the campus since he wasn\u2019t on campus the previous day.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was astounded to hear that but I told him to take the Road 7 route when ready to go home because Road 1 was blocked.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe asked me to sit down and he asked me the reason why the road was blocked then I told him that I didn\u2019t really know and heard that it was all about the appointment of the new VC.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe decided to leave the office immediately and he packed his things, saying that I was a godsend to him because it was almost 2 pm and he needed to pick up his son from school.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe carried the bag and as we were about to leave the office, I offered to help him with the bag but he declined and I headed for the door.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe grabbed me from behind and held me so tight. At this point I was in shock, then he said and I quote \u201cMo f\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ed \u00e8mi \u00e0ti \u1eb9 j\u1ecd w\u00e0 pap\u1ecd\u0300 ni [thrice] but problem t\u00ed mo n\u00ed t\u1eb9\u0301l\u1eb9\u0300 ni boy XXX y\u1eb9n but mi \u00f2 r\u00f2 p\u00e9 \u00f3 y\u1eb9 k\u00f3 j\u1eb9\u0301 problem m\u1ecd\u0301\u201d meaning \u2018I want us to be together, the problem was that boy (name withheld) but I don't think that should be a problem any longer\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt this point, he had already dropped the big bag he was carrying and he held me with his other hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe made me sit on his lap and was groping me, he then said again \u201cMi \u00f2 m\u1ecd b\u00ed a \u1e63e f\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63e \u00e9 t\u00ed o fi m\u00e1a graduate p\u1eb9\u0300l\u00fa 2:1 k\u00ed o l\u00e8 pad\u00e0 w\u00e1 \u1e63e master\u2019s\u201d (I don't know how to ensure you graduate with a 2:1 so you can come back to this school for master\u2019s degree).\n\n\n\n\u201cThen I told him that he should let me go and that I will come back to see him some other day just to free myself of him.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t answer me when I said that but he stood up from the chair still forcefully holding me and dragged me to the couch in his office.\n\n\n\n\"By this time, he had already pulled down his trousers, (and) brought out his erect penis. He grabbed my right hand and used it to rub his sexual penis. It happened so quickly that I was petrified.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe continued to rub his penis and I was so distressed by the entire situation that I lost count of time. In order to appeal to him to release his hold on me, I then told him that I needed to leave his office immediately because I was already taking too long and someone was patiently waiting for me downstairs.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut he replied me and said \u2018Gbogbo time t\u00ed mo n\u00ed p\u1eb9\u0300l\u00fa \u1eb9 b\u00e1y\u00ec\u00ed k\u00f2 ju 5mins l\u1ecd, j\u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0301 b\u00e1 mi \u1e63e \u00e9 mo k\u00e0n f\u1eb9\u0301 come ni (I won't stay longer than 5 minutes, please do it, I just want to come); I won\u2019t touch you today please because I didn\u2019t inform you before.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cI begged him that I was not comfortable at all that he should please let me go, but he didn\u2019t listen to me. He laid down on his couch and was using my hand to stroke his penis.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt some point, he stood up, dragged me to his table, turned my back to him and was rubbing his manhood on me. At this point, all my pleas to him to please release me fell on deaf ears.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe pinned me there against the table, rubbing his penis on my back, repeating over and over again, \u201cO \u1e63e \u00e9, O \u1e63e \u00e9\u201d (thank you).\n\n\n\n\u201cTaking advantage of my vulnerability because he is physically stronger than me, he sexually assaulted, molested, and violated me.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe used both his physical strength and high office and power as a professor in the Department of African Languages and Literatures to sexually impose himself on me, despite my pleas to him that I did not want his violent actions and forced attack on me.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor how long he was doing this to me, I could not tell because my heart was beating so fast out of fear, and I was drenched in sweat from a panic attack.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen he finally freed me, he asked me if I would see him 8 am on Monday and I said \u2018No\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe asked me why? Out of fear for my life and safety, I told him that it was because my place was far. I was trying hard to say whatever would make him release me. I had never been so terrified as I was that day in his office.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe asked me where my place was. And I told him that I live at Aba Iya Gani. He then offered to come and pick me (up) but I declined, after which he asked me if I knew Olatoke Hotel at Opa. I said I did not know the place and he said that was no problem; that anytime I\u2019m free to come on Monday, nobody will disturb him and then he gave me a thousand naira (N1,000) for transportation.\n\n\n\n\u201cI collected the money because I believed he wouldn\u2019t have allowed me to go if I didn\u2019t collect it from him. When we finally left the office, he sent me a message on WhatsApp thanking me and he asked if I would be on campus by 10 am on Monday and I told him that I didn\u2019t think so.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen he said, \u2018Okay, hope you are not traveling?\u2019 And I didn\u2019t reply him till now. The entire situation has left me feeling so traumatized. This is an obvious abuse of power in which my faith in someone who has been a teacher and mentor, someone that I look up to and had maximum respect for since the very day I entered this University, has been exploited.\n\n\n\n\u201cProfessor Opefeyitimi teaches a class that I currently take, and he has the power to fail me or give me any grade that he pleases. In addition, I took another class with him, and he has not yet released the grade for that class.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy career depends on the grades he gives me. I believe his failure to fully penetrate me in his office frustrated him, and I was lucky that I wore tight trousers that he was unable to yank down.\n\n\n\n\u201cI remain grateful to God that I was not wearing a dress or a skirt that day, otherwise, he would have succeeded in penetrating me, while rubbing his penis on my buttocks.\n\n\n\n\u201cSir, I am writing this message to call your attention to this defiling act and wrongful use of his professorial power and influence.\n\n\n\n\u201cI ask that justice be served and to ensure that he does not further harm me physically or in any other way: including removing from my grades; shaming me during classes and learning activities, because I did not cooperate during his molestation, assault and molestation that fateful day in his office, which will never be erased from my memory.\n\n\u201cI expect that Prof. Opefeyitimi is brought to justice. His action was so quick and immediate that I believe I am not his first victim.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe seemed to have practised this assault before because he seemed to know exactly what to say and what to do, as I looked stupefied before him, and he kept manipulating my body and using his genitalia as a weapon of assault.\n\n\n\n\u201cI look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.\"\n\nIn a letter addressed to the school\u2019s vice-chancellor, Prof. Tope Ogunbodede, Opefeyitimi denied the allegation of sexual assault, saying the female student was his fianc\u00e9e and that \u2018all that happened in my office was consensual\u2019.",

          "text": "\u2018\u2019It\u2019s not my problem.\u2019\u2019 \u2013 This was President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s immutable response to a question on his thoughts on the 2023 elections. Buhari has been coerced and blandished to assert himself like former President Olusegun Obasanjo who assumed the de facto office of godfather and technically installing the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua as president in 2007. But the president has remained stolid to these sweet temptations.\n\nBuhari has unremittingly warned members of his party \u2013 the All Progressives Congress \u2013 who are running for political office to desist from merchandising his name in their campaigns. At a meeting with party leaders in 2019, for instance, he said those running for office should work hard and convince the electorate to vote for them by dint of personal example. Using himself as a representative case, he said he ran for president multiple times but failed.\n\nThe president said he would not interfere or diddle with the electoral process to secure political advantage for anyone.\n\nHis words: \u201cWell, what I want to promise Nigerians is that I will work very hard on ensuring free and fair elections. All those that are going to succeed the National Assembly and the presidency, they better work very hard because I will make sure I use the law enforcement agents to ensure that elections are free and fair (and that) nobody uses his office or his resources to force himself on his constituency.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has again and again stated this position as regards the 2023 elections. Buhari is not the archetypal politician. He is placid and disinterested in ensconcing a political hegemony. He is empty of chicanery, and perhaps, full of childlike candour. He is politically guileless. His administration and whatever political edge that comes with it ends with him. I think this is the making of a democrat. A leader who will not want a puppet to succeed him and who will not try to maintain control of the government after him.\n\nBuhari said he would return to Daura to tend his farm at the end of his tenure, and he appears to be working according to his word. The only way up from the presidency for Buhari is Daura. If the president stays on this path, then it will be a new precedent \u2013 sepulchring the old 2007 Obasanjo/Yar\u2019Adua paradigm.\n\nBuhari is very reluctant about becoming a political godfather \u2013 even when it seems political knights-errant need him to be one. During the APC leadership crisis involving Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman, the president sequestered himself from the party and all the intrigues. He refused to be involved in the melee or take sides with any group. Some party insiders said he told them to \u2018\u2019behave themselves\u2019\u2019 and deal with the issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd during the national chairmanship tussle involving Mai Mala Buni, the president refused to move a hand. While there were plots and counterplots on the national convention, he totally unlooked. The party wobbled and tottered to purgatory, but the president was unfazed. He was even reluctant to name anyone as national chairman. The APC governors eventually had to impress it on Buhari why he should intervene and save the rocky boat.\n\nAt the meeting with the APC governors, the president was said to have nominated Abdullahi Adamu as national chairman. That was the only person he named for a position in the APC national working committee (NWC). But lists with names of certain persons for some offices purportedly endorsed by the president were already in circulation weeks to the national convention. Evidently, some acquisitive interests exploit Buhari\u2019s name to pursue their own agenda within the party.\n\nThe president\u2019s reason for being standoffish, according to those who know, is that he believes the party should be self-sustaining and self-governing; so that when he leaves office, the party can still function without his intervention. He just wants to go and rest in Daura after 2023.\n\nIn the build-up to the Edo governorship election of 2020, when the APC gave Godwin Obaseki the heave-ho, the governor who joined the PDP to actualise his ambition, still found support in Buhari. A few hours after his defection to the PDP, the governor was seen at the presidential villa grinning from ear to ear with Buhari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the 2019 governorship campaign rally in Imo, the president told residents to vote for any candidate they liked regardless of the party \u2013 this is to the stupefaction of the APC candidate and other party leaders present. His words: \u201cYou can vote for whosoever you want. Do not allow intra or inter-party affairs stop you from voting for the candidates of your choice.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari has shown rare political expansiveness. He does not interfere in or influence elections for anyone; he does not show exceptional preference for any candidate against another. But he gives the customary support to his party\u2019s candidates no doubt. He meets, smiles and take photographs with every candidate \u2013 whether PDP, APC or PRP.\n\nOn political matters, Buhari has really lived up to his 2015 pledge: \u2018\u2019I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody.\u2019\u2019\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "For the first time in the past decade, Netflix announced that it lost subscribers in a quarter.\n\nThe announcement was made by the streaming giant during its recent earnings call where it also shocked investors by forecasting that its number of subscribers would fall by another 2 million in the current quarter, to about 219.6 million, after declining about 200,000 in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nNetflix shares plummeted over 25%, shaving $30 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation after this announcement was made.\n\nNetflix previously told shareholders it\u2019s expected to add 2.5 million net subscribers during the first quarter. During the same period a year ago, Netflix added 3.98 million paid users.\n\nThe company said it would have seen 500,000 subscriber net additions during the most recent quarter, but for the suspension of its service in Russia and the winding-down of all Russian paid memberships which resulted in a loss of 700,000 subscribers.\n\nNetflix attributed the slowdown in part to saturation in its biggest markets, it also acknowledged the impact of rising competition from streaming services launched by traditional media groups such as Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount.\n\nIn the wake of its loss of subscribers, Netflix wants to maximise revenue from existing subscribers and viewers. To do this, the company is now looking into cracking down on password sharing, an act Hastings once described as \u2018a positive thing\u2019 a few years ago.\n\nOn the earnings call, Hastings said, \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of how to monetise sharing. We\u2019ve been thinking about that for a couple of years. When we were growing fast it wasn\u2019t a high priority to work on, now we\u2019re working super hard on it.\u201d\n\nNetflix estimates that there are about 100 million households that share passwords. The company has already started testing ways to prevent sharing passwords. COO Greg Peters explained on the call that Netflix is not planning to eliminate sharing passwords but most likely charge a premium on users who want to share their accounts with friends and family.\n\nTo curb the loss of subscribers Netflix is now planning to introduce lower-priced, ad-supported plans. This announcement hints that the company is open to exploring an alternative business model, considering that Netflix has raised prices 6 times in the last 8 years, making subscriptions twice as expensive as they were in 2014.\n\n\u201cThose who have followed Netflix know that I have been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cBut as much as I am a fan of that, I am a bigger fan of consumer choice, and allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising-tolerant to get what they want makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, Netflix has had a difficult time penetrating the mass market due to its high subscription price. Last year, the streaming giant introduced a $3.99 mobile-only plan that costs 50% less than the standard plan.\n\nUnlike the typical 30 days trial which gives users access to Netflix\u2019s full library for a limited time, in this free plan, Netflix is only making about one-quarter of its movies and television shows catalogue available. Even at that, the $3.99 is still a lot to ask from many Africans, as 490 million people in Africa live under the poverty line of $1.90/day according to a 2021 UN estimate.\n\nThe ad-supported model might be Netflix\u2019s best chance at unlocking growth on the African continent, which consists of an audience that might not be able to pay higher prices but is comfortable with ads.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars Seier Christensen, Chairman, Concordium Foundation and founder of Seier Capital, met with some stakeholders in the blockchain, financial, and tech space in an exclusive event held at Four Points by Sheraton on Thursday, April 14.\n\nThe much-anticipated event had notable personalities in the Nigeria tech and blockchain space, including influencers.\n\nLars Seier Christensen gave a lecture touching on the blockchain, the internet, Concordium blockchain, and investing, among others.\n\nHis talk stressed that the Concordium blockchain is big on compliance and working with regulators because he believes that blockchain technology regulation is inevitable.\n\nHe said regulators couldn\u2019t have worked for many years to regulate the traditional financial systems just to watch them get dismantled without fighting back or trying to regulate them.\n\n\u201cThis opens up for a new transformation of the economy because it can both make a lot of existing processes much more safe, much more efficient, much more secure, much more trustworthy,\u201d He said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars said that there will be entirely newer business models built based on blockchain. Cryptocurrencies, coins, and tokens are not blockchain\u2019s major focus or use case. The important thing about blockchain is blockchain.\n\nYou only need your tokens to encourage some things happening on the blockchain because you need a very efficient and quick means of payment. Normal foreign exchanges cannot meet that requirement at this point, and if they could, there probably won\u2019t be the need for this technology.\n\nAccording to Lars, cryptocurrencies have taken much of the attention away from what blockchain is really about: improving your business model, keeping your data safe, and ensuring that people do what they agreed to do.\n\nHe raised concerns about the anonymity in the blockchain and why it can be dangerous. From his experience in the traditional financial systems, regulators work to protect people from those who are smarter and more knowledgeable than them in the financial market or protect them from getting into something that they didn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cI think that for blockchain to be successful, it has to respect those aspects of a normal society that are exactly the same. You don\u2019t want it to be possible to cheat people who don\u2019t understand it, and there is a need to hold people accountable for bad behaviour and prevent vices like terror financing, money laundering, and so on.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lars, the basic premise of concordium is a blockchain that has a better balance between privacy and accountability than an average blockchain. The bottom line is that it is built to be able to provide the building blocks for the regulations that will surely come.\n\nAnother important thing to remember about concordium is that it is a layer one infrastructural blockchain such as Ethereum, and it is something you can build your user base upon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use cases for blockchain are immense, and one of the use cases of a well-built blockchain is the preservation of data. Another strong use case for blockchain is the registration of ownership.\n\nLars also highlighted the importance of educating one\u2019s self about the blockchain and its many use cases to make informed decisions. Interestingly, according to Mr Lars, the good news is that the blockchain is not very complicated.\n\nGiving reasons for investing in the African continent, he cited that the continent has a relatively young population, which according to him, is a good thing because it is far better to have more younger people than older generations.\n\nIt is a huge benefit, and he believes it is important to educate the young generation on business, economics, technology, and understanding of society because the higher the level of education of a society, the higher their prosperity.\n\nIt is important to educate them so they can take on the opportunities that present themselves.\n\nLars is very optimistic about the future of Africa and Nigeria.\n\nHe advised that people should look into the blockchain and keep themselves informed.\n\nHe added, \u201cI look to invest in Nigeria thanks to its thriving tech culture that seems to be here.\u201d\n\nAnswering a question bordering regulation of crypto in Nigeria, he said it\u2019s important to distinguish between what is speculative crypto and what is not. Most people lose money when they trade speculatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting an example of European Regulators recognising that blockchain is important for growing the economy, and they want protection against the abuses of crypto, and that\u2019s a balance that is needed to be found.\n\nHowever, he admitted to having little or no influence on lifting the ban on crypto in Nigeria.\n\nThere seems to be a focus on the negatives or things that could go wrong. However, Lars hopes that people see the positives and things can come out that will help transparency, efficiency and grow the economy, inclusive to many people. All these have to be balanced against restricting abuse.\n\nConcordium is a blockchain that\u2019s compliance-ready with today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s economies.\n\nIt is a science-based proof-of-stake blockchain created for all, with unique business applications in mind.\n\nThe blockchain has identification built into the protocol to meet regulatory requirements while delivering a user-friendly platform that can handle smart contracts.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the opening of its first product development centre in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.\n\nOver the next two years, Google plans to hire over 100 employees across software engineering, research, and design roles and, with this launch, joins Visa and Microsoft in setting up shop in Nairobi.\n\nIn October 2021, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, announced that the company planned to invest $1 billion in projects that will \u201cprovide fast, reliable, affordable internet across the continent; build helpful, local products; and support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that underpin Africa\u2019s economies.\u201d This product development centre is just one of such projects.\n\nAs the global battle for tech talent heats up, African tech talents have been thrust into the spotlight. With record-breaking sums pumped into startups on the continent, who can blame Big Tech companies for hustling to get a piece of the pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, while this development bodes well for local talents, it affects the ability of local startups or businesses to hire suitable talents.\n\nPer Financial Times, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Center in 2019 and its subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best hands to Microsoft.\n\nAccording to Caine Wanjau, Twiga Foods CTO, \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s entry changed the dynamics of the software engineer market overnight. The company liked what they saw not only in software engineers but product managers and designers, and still now they are actively recruiting.\u201d\n\nWith Microsoft offering significantly higher salaries, local startups lost some employees. While Twiga Foods lost four employees, Lori Systems \u2014 another startup \u2014 lost six employees.\n\nBut with Google and Visa joining the fray, the competition for local talent will only increase. And some local entrepreneurs admit as much.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa, June Odongo, Senga Technologies Founder and CEO, said, \u201cIn the short term, this will be a strain for startups such as ours, particularly from a compensation perspective given that we are not only competing with the world\u2019s largest technology companies but are also doing so in an ecosystem with different macroeconomic variables from the US.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester, Mazi Mobility CEO and Founder, believes that while local entrepreneurs cannot compete on pricing, the presence of Big Tech companies will benefit the local ecosystem in the long run.\n\n\u201cThe tech giants have a penchant for snatching up top talent, which in turn affects the ecosystem negatively for startups who can\u2019t compete on pricing. Therefore, they have an opportunity to bring up the collective technological skills whilst still enabling top-class developers to be within reach for startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great for the local ecosystem; more talent and hubs will lead to better software products and development across the country. Hopefully, this will increase the number of highly skilled developers.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Kagure Wamunyu, Jumba Founder and CEO, believes that this will allow local developers to contribute to the local economy while working for global companies.\n\n\u201cThe recent launch by these global companies will certainly make the talent market a bit more competitive. However, this also gives an opportunity for talent to work for global companies and still contribute to the local economy, as opposed to having to relocate to the West,\u201d she said.\n\nOdongo and Wamunyu both have experience working for global companies and believe that such developments are good for the long-term growth of the local ecosystem.\n\n\u201cLonger term, this is good for the ecosystem, both for developers and companies. Large companies nurture talent, which further seeds and has a multiplier effect on an ecosystem. Outsourcing talent to Indian companies such as Tata and Wipro by Microsoft, EMC and such is arguably the biggest contributor to India\u2019s current tech boom; we\u2019ll see the same here.\n\n\u201cI had the opportunity to work for such firms learning industry-leading skills, and I\u2019m now here in Kenya with a startup; I think more Kenyans should have those opportunities if they desire such environments,\u201d Odongo added.\n\nSimilarly, Wamunyu sees this as validation for the local ecosystem\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cHaving major tech companies invested in Kenya should help shine more of a spotlight on what African companies have achieved over the years, with the help and support of employees, as well as provide an enabling environment for more partnerships and investment opportunities.\u201d\n\nForrester also hopes that the arrival of companies like Google will encourage local non-traditional investors to step forward.\n\n\u201cThe investment singles out Africa as the next frontier for development. A true testament to Africa taking on a more central role in the startup scene globally. I think this will allay fears of the quality of talent we have on the continent, which is great and encourage non-traditional investors in Africa to come forward,\u201d he remarked.\n\nUnable to compete on salaries and benefits, Kenyan startups need to find ways to attract and retain talent. Building great products that provide employees with more autonomy and the feeling of being on a mission might be one way to go, and Odongo agrees.\n\n\u201cWe hope to retain our developers by building more interesting and game-changing products and are motivated to scale faster so that we can pay better. Startups, of course, also have their own dynamics which are preferred by a certain set, so that will always remain true.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "No fewer than eight Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have leveraged the short-term funding opportunities at the commercial papers (CP) market this year in a bid to raise a total of N135 billion.\n\nThe companies that have their CPs either registered or quoted on the platform of the FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited include MeCure Industries Limited, which has its N20 billion CP Issuance Programme registered, and Mixta Real Estate Plc (N25 billion).\n\nOthers are Babban Gona Farmers Services Nigeria Limited (N15 billion); Coleman Technical Industries Limited (N20 billion); NECIT Nigeria Limited (N20 billion); Skymark Partners Limited (N5 billion); Veritasi Homes & Properties Limited (N10 billion); and Prima Corporation Limited (N30 billion).\n\nCPs are unsecured short-term debt instruments (in the form of a promissory note) used by corporate entities to meet their working capital requirements and pay off short-term debts. Put simply, a CP is an unconditional promise by the issuer to pay to the order of an investor a certain sum at a future date.\n\nAnalysts say that if many SMEs can access the market for commercial papers, other mezzanine financing, bonds, and even equity, there would be enhanced financial inclusion.\n\nThey said this would foster capital formation requisite for developing the manufacturing, industrial and service sectors and ultimately creating jobs, reducing dependency on imports and enhancing the welfare and overall lifestyle of Nigerians in an inclusive and sustainable manner.\n\nAbiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based financial analyst, told BusinessDay that SMEs occupy a very important position, stressing the need for them to be strengthened and given access to diverse sources of funding and capital.\n\nAccording to him, while the SMEs are increasingly positioning to meet the requirements to access funding through the capital market, including issuance of commercial papers and bonds, a larger percentage are still excluded due to their inability to meet relevant standards and sometimes due to their relatively small size, which discourages financial advisers and other relevant parties from taking on their transactions.\n\nOn the platform of FMDQ Securities Exchange, there are 62 registered CP programmes valued at over N3.63 trillion and 340 quoted CPs valued at N2.71 trillion.\n\n\u201cAs a survey by PwC revealed, Nigerian SMEs contribute more than half of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and employ over three-quarter of the labour force, yet less than half of them can access credit, mainly through the banking sector and sometimes at terms that may not support the fundamental reality of their businesses,\u201d Rasaq said.\n\nAccording to the financial analyst, while banks often justifiably or otherwise have very low appetite for SME financing, these businesses often do not meet the requirement to access financing from the capital market.\n\n\u201cNotably, the need for investor protection against probable abuse of issuers and other market participants reinforces the need to ensure all issuers of securities in the capital market meet minimum standards, including having an investment grade rating from any of the SEC-approved credit rating agencies like DataPro, Agusto and GCR, amongst other requirements such as the existence of up-to-date audited financial statements and relevant governance standards,\u201d Rasaq added.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s first vertically integrated financial market infrastructure group, the FMDQ Securities Exchange has continued to avail its platform as well as its listing and quotation services to suit the needs of issuers looking to seamlessly raise finance from the debt capital market.\n\nFMDQ Securities Exchange currently has an average annual market turnover of N165.78 trillion. On its platform are 88 bonds/Sukuk (excluding Eurobonds) valued at over N1.96 trillion; 474 listed/quoted Federal Government of Nigeria debt securities worth N91.96 trillion; listed/quoted corporate debt securities valued at N3.71 trillion; and $59 billion worth of OTC FX Futures traded.\n\nAt the start to this year, FMDQ Exchange approved for quotation the MeCure Industries Limited N490million Series 1 and N1.44 billion Series 2 CPs under its N20billion CP Issuance Programme on its platform.\n\n\u201cThe issuance will help the company meet its short-term working capital and funding requirements. It will also strengthen our commitment to building and positively shaping the healthcare industry in Nigeria,\u201d said Samir Udani, chairman/CEO of MeCure Industries.\n\nMeCure Industries is a human therapeutics company in the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria.\n\nComing on the heels of the quotation of MeCure Industries CPs, FMDQ Securities Exchange approved the registration of the Mixta Real Estate N25 billion CP Issuance Programme on its platform.\n\nMixta, a subsidiary of Mixta Africa, is a real estate development company in Nigeria, with operations spanning the residential, commercial, and retail sectors of the Nigerian real estate industry.\n\nIn January, FMDQ Exchange approved the registration of the Babban Gona Farmers Services Nigeria N15 billion CP Programme on its platform. Babban Gona is a social enterprise that seeks to sustainably improve the lives of smallholder farmers in Nigeria through the provision of comprehensive farming services.\n\n\u201cWe are an agricultural franchise committed to curbing the growing trend of poverty and violence in Africa by creating opportunities of dignified and fulfilling work for the rural farmer youths. We aim to make farming more profitable for smallholder farmers as we support them across the entire production chain,\u201d said Bukola Masha, managing director of Babban Gona.\n\n\u201cWith the successful registration of this N15 billion CP Programme, we are a step closer to achieving this goal; we are delighted at the opportunity to diversify our short-term funding sources and look forward to the participation of the investment community when we launch Series 1 of the CP Programme,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: FMDQ Exchange admits Prima Corporation Series 2 Commercial Paper on its platform\n\nIn March, the Exchange approved the quotation of the Coleman Technical Industries N2.40 billion Series 3 and N3.65 billion Series 4 CPs under its N20billion CP Issuance. Coleman Technical Industries Limited is a producer and distributor of electrical wires and cables.\n\nNECIT Nigeria got approval last month for the quotation of its N2.17 billion Series 1 CP under its N20billion CP Issuance Programme.\n\n\u201cWith this support, our capacity to unlock value for all stakeholders has been further enhanced,\u201d said Emmanuel Iheagwazi, MD/CEO of NECIT Nigeria, an indigenous company that deals in the manufacturing of car lubricants and engine oil, as well as the importation and sale of base oil.\n\nThe Exchange also approved the registration of Skymark Partners Limited N5billion CP. \u201cWe expect funds raised under this CP programme to enable us to expand our investment opportunities,\u201d Egie Akpata, the chairman of the company, said.\n\nEarly this month, the registration of Veritasi Homes & Properties N10billion CP Programme was approved.\n\nVeritasi is a real estate company providing marketing, advisory and developmental services across the real estate value chain in Nigeria. \u201cWe are delighted that the proceeds from the issuance of the CP will be applied to develop superior real estate projects designed for clients at home and in the diaspora,\u201d said Nola Adetola, its MD.\n\nLast week, approval was given for the registration of the SKLD Integrated Services Limited N2billion CP Programme on the FMDQ Exchange platform.\n\nSKLD Integrated Services is an integrated corporate entity providing educational and office supplies, branded product distribution, technology, garment manufacturing and humanitarian aid procurement services through contracts, wholesale, retail and online channels.\n\n\u201cThe successful establishment of our N2billion CP Programme confirms SKLD Integrated Services Limited\u2019s ambition to harness the Nigerian capital market, in funding its operations and strategy. It also gives credence to SKLD\u2019s belief in the Nigerian DCM and puts the Company in a position to broaden its potential funding sources and create superior value,\u201d Tayo Osiyemi, the company\u2019s deputy MD, said.\n\nThe Exchange has also welcomed on its platform the quotation of the Prima Corporation Limited N7.02 billion Series 2 CP under its N30 billion CP Programme.

          "title": "Trading trumps research in Nigerian pharmaceutical firms",
          "text": "Pharmaceutical companies in Nigeria are more interested in trading than investing in research and development of drugs, therapies, and treatments, a BusinessDay analysis has shown.\n\nBig pharmaceutical companies in developed countries are increasing their risk appetite for investing in untested diseases and are raking in billions of dollars from product sales and patent rights.\n\nWhile multinational drugmakers\u2019 investments in research and development grew by the most following the outbreak of COVID-19, attracting additional funds from development donors, research activities in Nigeria\u2019s private drug-making sector were few and far between.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of the financials of the six largest drugmakers listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited shows that none of the producers had a specific budget for research except May & Baker, despite recording 76 percent growth in profit in 2021. They made more in profit and revenue from increased demand for prescription drugs and heightened health consciousness amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, one of the companies, for instance, says it charges research and development expenditure to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. But it did not mention specific research goals targeted in Nigeria.\n\nIts parent company in the UK spent \u00a34.8 billion on research and development focused on the immune system, human genetics, and advanced technologies. Some analysts have described its Nigerian unit as a sales outlet for its products.\n\nOthers, including Fidson, Morrison Industries Ltd., Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals and Pharma Deko Plc do not have fixed investment budgets reflected in their books.\n\nWhat May & Baker has for research and development is categorised under distribution, sales and marketing expenses, which increased to N9.3 million in 2021 from N7.8 million in 2020.\n\nInterest in research has failed to grow, despite incentives such as the N200 billion health intervention fund introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in 2020. It is targeted at the research and development of candidate drugs, herbal medicines and vaccines for the control, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.\n\nHowever, more than 50 percent of the financing has been spent on things outside research and development in a country plagued by different diseases requiring local solutions and where the malaria burden is the highest in the world.\n\nOut of N200 billion, N107.7 billion has gone to 114 healthcare projects, which are focused on medical diagnostics, drugs, dental services, and eye clinics, according to the CBN.\n\nSome analysts say part of the reasons most local drugmakers see research as a lacklustre venture is that they are still stuck with the colonial orientation that research is not an African thing and most African companies do not realise the potential buried in it.\n\nOyewale Tomori, a retired professor of Virology, identified the lack of foresight, inadequate government support, and the risk of counterfeiting as three major hurdles discouraging local investment in research.\n\nHe said,: \u201cThose who are investing in research are not doing it because they love it. They are investing in it because they make money out of it. They see that if they can do research to get a product, then they can sell and have monopoly and patents.\n\n\u201cTheir government also supports them to put money in research because the government realises that when they do research and make money, they also get more taxes. So it helps everybody. Our government also does not support it.\u201d\n\nWhat big players are doing\n\nBefore the pandemic began, Pfizer\u2019s research and development expenses stood at $8.4 billion in 2019. In 2020, it rose by 11 percent to $9.4 billion after the pandemic broke out and jumped 44 percent to $13.8 billion in 2021.\n\nIts revenue also followed a similar pattern as it recorded $81.3 billion in 2021 compared to $41.6 billion in 2020 and $51.8 billion in 2019.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s research and development budget declined slightly from $6 billion in 2019 to $5.9 billion in 2020 but jumped by 62 percent to $9.7 billion in 2021. The result in revenue was growth from $24.3 billion in 2019 to $26.6 billion in 2020 and $37.4 billion in 2020.\n\nModerna increased its research and development budget from $496 million in 2019 to $1.4 billion in 2020 and approximately $2 billion in 2021. Its revenue surged from $60 million in 2019 to $680 million in 2020 and $18.5 billion in 2021.\n\n\u201cAs we enter our second year as a commercialised company, we are undertaking sustained, long-term investments in technology creation, which is reflected in our R&D investments of $1.99 billion, compared to $1.37 billion in 2020. This gives us the opportunity to build a better Moderna and develop mRNA medicines for everyone,\u201d the company said in its 2021 full-year report.\n\nIt plans to expand its global health portfolio through two new initiatives aimed at advancing mRNA vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases. It aims to advance a portfolio of 15 vaccine programs by 2025 that target emerging or neglected infectious diseases that threaten global health.\n\nThe company is also launching a new programme, mRNA Access, that will offer researchers the use of Moderna\u2019s mRNA technology to explore new vaccines against infectious diseases more broadly.\n\nAnalysts say if Nigeria does not take a cue in a similar direction, the country will remain a passive actor in the invention of medical breakthroughs and might be forced to wait months for medicines or treatments to arrive in periods of urgent need like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Africa currently imports 70 to 90 percent of its drugs, due to a very poor biotechnology sector. For comparison, China and India, with comparable populations, import 5 percent, and 20 percent.\n\nThere is also a severe shortage of human resources as indicators show there are currently only around 1,900 epidemiologists in Africa, far fewer than the 6,000 needed, as stipulated by the Global Health Security Agenda.\n\nThe continent continues to struggle to secure medical supplies. More than 70 countries imposed restrictions on the export of medical materials including the raw materials needed to make diagnostics during the early months of the pandemic. Countries couldn\u2019t start procuring medical supplies at a pace that better met demand until the African Union established the Africa Medical Supplies Platform in June 2020.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nDivine providence did a lot in the life of great men in the world, men who make up their minds to make great impact and to stand out in their fields of learning no matter what.\n\nThe is the story of a young boy who dreamt of building world class Hospital and Medical Clinics in Africa that will be accessible to all. People in Africa especially Nigeria will be able to enjoy good Healthcare facilities.\n\nIndeed, good things are achieved through hard work, determination, resilience and perseverance in order to thread the path of honour. Yes, success is not for lazy men but for the hardworking and intelligent once. All these statements could best be used to describe the personality of Dr Nosa Aigbe lebarty who became an achiever through seriousness and steadfastness, making his way to progress and greatness in the field of Medicine.\n\nMeeting Dr Nosa Aigbe lebarty, MD CEO and Chief Medical Officer Centralmed Urgent and Primary Care, Founder, Lebarty Medical PLLC, President, Project Health Africa for the first time gives one the impression that this young and vibrant Medical doctor knows exactly what he is doing and want to do.\n\nThe Health situation in Nigeria is gradually turning into something else; hence the need for this young Edo man reaching out to the people requires commendation.\n\nHearing Dr Nosa speak about his passion and dreams for the African man especially his place of birth (Edo State), one will begin to wonder. Dr Nosa has an evidence based holistic approach and training in urgent care, primary care and specialized addiction Medicine. He has more than 20 years of combined experience in medical treatment; he is setting up a world class hospital in Africa that will be accessible to all and give people in Africa access to quality Healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, he saw that a lot of people especially the elderly and children find it difficult to access the health facilities mostly because of funds. And as a medical doctor in the US (United States of America) he has seen the way the medical Healthcare is done here in Africa so different from the way it\u00eds done abroad. That is the reason why he is coming to build a hospital in Benin City and nearby villages. And as a general Practitioner, he said he decided to come home to help the people. Dr. Nosa said what is driving his desire to build this project is his love and passion for the place of his birth, Edo State Nigeria where his heart is.\n\nA proud Bini man, he feels concern about the less privileged, knowing fully well that in Africa, the first thing people worry about is what to eat instead of taking care of their health, just as the saying goes that \u00ecHealth is Wealth\u00ee.\n\nThat is why he wants to set up a hospital where people can afford to go and get what they need to help their condition health wise. According to Dr. Nosa, another significant part of his hospital is to take care of the old and elderly. He said that section will be named after his grandmother. Most of the old and elderly who have children overseas usually don\u00edt like or want to travel and so at the end of the day house helps are hired to attend to their needs. But most people prefers institutions like the care home because some of these hired helps don\u00edt usually take adequate care of them. But if institutions like a care home attached to the hospital is provided, the aged can have a place to stay, where they will be well taken care of by professionals including their medical care and everything they need. The goal according to Dr. Nosa is to inspire the people.\n\nThe monetary aspect to be able to access the Facility will be very minimal compared to what is presently paid in our health institutions. And the reason according to Dr. Nosa is because of maintenance to keep the place going.\n\nThe good thing about this project is that the state governor Mr. Godwin Obaseki is seriously interested in investors coming in to the state to develop it. Anything that will help make Edo State shine out to the world is what brings joy to the governor and people of the state, Edo state is going to be great again.\n\nAs the dream becomes a reality, the people of Edo State are waiting patiently to welcome and be part of this wonderful Healthcare facilities which Dr. Nosa Aigbe lebarty will use to bring hope to the hopeless and courage to the downtrodden to now be able to access health care in improved standard of health facilities in the state.\n\nIndeed, it is a welcome development.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The committee, which also sat and clinically deliberated on this same matter, recommended appropriate disciplinary actions against Professor Ayo Opefeyitimi to the university management.\n\n\u201cOf course, the university administration would have to present its recommendations to the Governing Council which has the final say on the matter, considering the status of the staff involved,\u201d he said.\n\nHe gave the assurance that the present university management does not condone sexual rascality of any form, under any guise against any member of the University community from anybody no matter how highly placed.\n\nHe noted that as a mark of its zero tolerance for sexual harassment, the management had summarily dismissed three lecturers who had committed similar sexual offences",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday in Abuja warned the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) members to be more mindful of the pitfalls that led to the ouster of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015.\n\nHe spoke at a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party, which held at Trancorp Hilton Hotel.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thought that only time could remove them, and the time actually came. They thought it was impossible to lose elections,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the APC was formed by a merger of Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), some members from All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the new PDP, which was a faction of the then ruling party.\n\n\u201cWe put together a committee with clear terms of reference on how to remove the PDP from power. The PDP thought it wasn\u2019t going to be possible. But it happened,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari told new members of the National Working Committee (NWC), which had been delegated powers of NEC for a period, to work towards keeping the party together by creating more room for discussions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to develop differences among ourselves. We have no time for that,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President commended Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and all its members for offering themselves to serve the party at a critical moment in utmost satisfaction despite all the attendant challenges, and for organizing the National Convention that produced the NWC.\n\n\u201cI must also sincerely thank all the aspirants for their desire to serve but had to withdraw their aspirations for the over-all interest of our Party. I consider it an honour to my person and an unwavering sacrifice for the unity of our great party as we approach the coming elections.\n\n\u201cI plead with all aspirants who were not elected to put in efforts in support of the leaderships of the Party to achieve our goal of success in the forthcoming elections. Furthermore I am pleading with all litigants to withdraw cases against the Party and put faith in party mechanisms.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also advised party leaders against imposing unpopular candidates on the APC.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you all to follow due process in all the party processes and more importantly to develop more mechanisms against corruption. I call on all party members to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to leaders of our party to avoid imposition of candidates that cannot win popular elections.\n\n\u201cThis dictatorial behavior cost us many strategic seats in the past. In the recent past this led to some of our strong members unfortunately opting to go elsewhere because of unfairly oppressive behavior of party leaders at state level.\n\n\u201cI must caution strongly against any tendency towards developing cliques, in\u2013fighting within the party. We want to win well not succumb to factions on account of personal acerbities and desire to retain control at all costs. That surely is not the road to win,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also congratulated the new National Chairman of APC, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, and the entire NWC members.\n\n\u201cYou came in at a critical time and the entire party has a high expectation from you. The critical task ahead of you remains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needful compromises in the interest of our great party,\u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari felicitated with party leaders and members for successfully conducting the Ward, Local Government, State Congresses, and the National Convention, in compliance with the Party Constitution.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you all to recognize the place of due process in all our tasks as managers of the party. We must develop party in-built mechanisms against corruption. Our success in 2023 will depend more on our capacity to respect our own extant rules, and regulations.\n\n\u201cNow that NEC has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the Party Constitution in the overall interest of the Party, I want to assure Mr. Chairman and the entire NWC members of my full support,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remark, the APC Chairman appreciated President Buhari for always working for the unity and survival of the party, assuring that the NWC will further unite the party, and ensure victory at the polls.\n\n\u201cWe must succeed, failure is not an option,\u2019\u2019 the APC Chairman said.\n\nThe NEC meeting was attended by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, other principal officers of the National Assembly, APC governors and state party chairmen.\n\nHe also warned of tougher security measures in restive parts of the country, with review of operations and strategy, reassuring Nigerians that the efforts that resulted in relative peace in South-South, and rescuing of North-East from the hold of terrorists will be ramped up.\n\nThe President noted that the major security challenges have remained in the North Central and North West, saying, \u201cWe are going to be very tough.\u2019\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI will like us to reflect on what the situation was before we came in. How many Local Government Areas were under the control of terrorists in the North-East?\n\n\u201cIn the South-South, we all know what the situation was; now we have relative peace. With the resources at our disposal, we have done very well.\n\n\u201cPeople are very forgetful. Our main problem now is in the North West and North Central. People are killing one another in these places, what for? We are going to be very tough,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

Therefore the approved total one million pilgrims for the 2022 Hajj is far less than 50 per cent of the number of pilgrims that performed the 2019 Hajj rites.",

We are not happy that SON is not allowed to operate at its maximum capacity especially with their presence being felt at the port.\n\n\u201cNigeria is import dependent with porous borders and for them not to be at the port to inspect these goods first hand is not good enough. They should be allowed to be at the port to see these products before they enter into the market\u201d, he said.\n\nRecall, that years ago ,the Standard Organization of Nigeria has vacated the seaports, the intention of the government is to allow the Agency do the role of regulation outside the ports.\n\nHowever, the increase in the imports of sub-standard goods and the effort of some freethinker have shown that there is need to reverse this executive decision inorder to win the war against importation of sub-standard goods in Nigeria.\n\nAlso a stakeholder, Mr Yinka Adegboyega called on the managers of the economy to bring SON back to the nation\u2019s seaports, adding that this is the easiest and safest way to stop these goods from coming into the country.\n\n\u201cThese goods are better checked at the ports not in the markets. Dealing in fake and substandard products is a crime to humanity and poses great danger for the nation\u2019s economy, as a result of this, we must collaborate with SON to collectively fight this battle against a substandard goods. We were not doing this before, but the new SON boss has told us and convinced us that this is the only way out to stamp out these goods. We have seen his desires and commitment to fighting this war and we need to contribute our own quota by lending our support to SON\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nENROLMENTS for the Biometric Verification Number (BVN) by bank account owners in the country rose by 2.3 million in the last three months, New Telegraph has learnt. According to data released by the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), the new enrolments recorded between January and March brought the total registration to 54 million as of April 10, 2022.\n\nAs of December 26, 2021, the enrolment for the number stood at 51.7 million. Checks revealed that the BVN database grew by six million in the year. NIBSS data showed that active bank accounts in the country stood at 133.5 million as of December 2021.\n\nWhile there may be multiple accounts linked to a single BVN, industry analysts said there is still a gap between bank accounts and BVN registrations, which must be filled.\n\nAccording to NIBSS, BVN gives bank account owners a unique identity that can be verified across the Nigerian banking industry, while it ensures that customers\u2019 bank accounts are protected from nauthorised access.\n\nEmphasising the need for the number, NIBSS noted that with the increasing incidents of compromise on conventional security systems (password and PIN), there was a high demand for greater security for access to sensitive or personal information in the Banking System.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, biometric technologies have been used to analyze human characteristics as an enhanced form of authentication for real-time security processes,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in collaboration with the Bankers\u2019 Committee, NIBSS, and a German firm, Dermalog, launched the $50 million BVN project on February 14, 2014, with the aim of capturing biometrics of all bank customers and giving them a unique identity that can be verified across the Nigerian banking industry.\n\nThe project is also aimed at deepening financial inclusion in the country. To have many more Nigerians on the BVN database, CBN had in December 2019 announced the commencement of the classification BVN 2.0 plan that allows both the rich and poor in rural areas to access financial services.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who broke the news at the end of the 11th Bankers\u2019 Committee retreat in Ogere, Ogun State, explained that BVN will now be classified into two, BVN Premium and BVN Lite.\n\nAccording to him, while BVN Premium covers customers that can provide the 18 basic requirements for a complete BVN enrolment, the BVN Lite requires minimal documentations like name and phone numbers for bank customers, especially those in the rural areas that do not meet the full requirements.\n\nThe initiative, which is in collaboration with the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) and Mobile Money Operators (MMOs), would ensure more Nigerians are brought into the financial system.\n\n\u201cThe BVN 2.0 classification scheme will help bring more people into the financial system and reduce the financial exclusion rate,\u201d the CBN Governor had said.\n\nThe \u201cKnow Your Customer (KYC) scheme is part of what will be migrated into the BVN Lite. However, some people are currently financially excluded, like people in our rural communities that carry phones but do not have financial services.\n\nWith the collaboration of NCC, we are putting this BVN arrangement to allow them to conduct minimal financial services. \u201cIt should be possible for us to migrate these people into the BVN lite arrangement where they can conduct minimal financial services, not just banking services, but minimal financial services, insurance, and anything you want to conduct in terms of finance, e-payment, or anything, you can do it with the aid of your phone.\n\nBringing them into the financial system will help to increase the rate of financial inclusion and reduce the exclusion rate,\u201d Emefiele added",

The eventual assent by Mr. President signalled a new era in the oil and gas sector of the economy after almost two decades of unsuccessful efforts to have the law passed in the country.\u201d\n\nHe said the enactment of the PIA would usher in new investment opportunities in the Nigerian Petroleum Industry with massive opportunities for every industry player. \u201cIt is to this end, that the Legislative Arm of Government in its wisdom deemed it necessary to involve various stakeholders and professionals in the oil and gas industry like you and I in the making of these regulations.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, effective regulations are key to harnessing the gains of the PIA and the Government has a mandate of ensuring sound management of the oil and gas sector considering the key role the sector plays in the revenue generation of the country. \u201cThis is why the Presidential Steering Committee on the PIA, which I chair as the Minister of State Petroleum Resources, has played this pivotal role in collaborating with the Commission in the drafting of the first set of regulations, which will be presented for review at this interactive forum.\u201d\n\nThe minister stated that the effort of the Commission in the preparation of these draft regulations to beat the deadline set by the law for the commencement of the implementation of the PIA is quite commendable.\n\nHe said he was hopeful that the regulations when fully implemented will help in no small measure in the smooth take-off of the day-to-day operations of the NUPRC.",

The case has gotten over the issue of community police. It is now State police. It is from that State Police that we can now be talking about community police,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also spoke on the need to strengthen the traditional system and the local government administration, \u201cwhich I prepared during the popular Murtala/Obasanjo administration, because I believe that there is need to enable that tier of government to work truly as a local governmen. They have their own Executive, Judiciary and Legislature.\n\n\u201cThey were working and they were very visible, building and managing roads, looking into education, health, local administration, agriculture, but they were all gone,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nHe said that the experience the former chairmen had in local government administration was enough to aspire for higher posts, stressing that some of them have the competence, ability and integrity to get to these posts.\n\nObasanjo, who was presented with a letter of a life patron, assured that he would look into their request, assuring further that he would be available on request for their needs at all times.\n\nAshipa had earlier told the former President why they decided to come together in all the 774 local governments in the country, declaring, \u201cwe can also contribute to the economy and political developments of the country.\n\n\u201cAnd realising your position as father of local government in Nigeria, we need you to actualize our goals, hence this all important visit.

They could each face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe charges against Fico and Kali\u00e1k, according to David Lindtner, a lawyer for Fico and Kali\u00e1k, pertain to crimes they allegedly performed as Cabinet members between 2012 and 2018, while Smer anchored successive ruling coalitions. Former President Andrej Kiska and Boris Koll\u00e1r, the current speaker of Slovakia\u2019s parliament, are among those accused of using confidential tax information to run smear campaigns against them.\n\nFico was accused of being the leader of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that includes former police director Tibor Gap\u00e1r and Slovak oligarch Norbert Bodor, according to the indictment.\n\nHe stood for president in 2014, while serving his second term as Prime Minister of Slovakia, but was defeated by Kiska by nearly 20 percentage points. Fico accused Kiska of \u201cmaking his money from usury on impoverished people,\u201d \u201cmisusing his charity for political goals,\u201d and having \u201cclose ties to Scientology\u201d during an exceptionally acrimonious campaign.\n\nFico and Kali\u00e1k allegedly acquired unlawful access to tax documents in 2017, and the prime minister, then in his third term, began referring to President Kiska as a \u201ctax cheat.\u201d\n\nHowever, the 2018 murders of investigative journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak, 28, and his fianc\u00e9e Martina Kunirov\u00e1 brought Fico\u2019s premiership and government to an end. The release of thousands of private messages between Kuciak\u2019s alleged killers and police, judges, and ruling-coalition politicians galvanized voters, propelling the anti-corruption Ordinary People movement to power in 2020.",

          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron cleared a major hurdle on the path to re-election with a combative TV debate performance against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen that convinced most viewers, a poll said, even if he was still deemed arrogant.\n\nAlthough Le Pen came across as more polished and composed than in a TV duel for the presidency in 2017, Macron went on the offensive over her ties to Russian leadership, her plans for the economy and her policy for the European Union.\n\nWith the deciding vote just four days away, some 59% of viewers found Macron to have been the most convincing in the debate, according to a snap poll for BFM TV. That suggested the almost three-hour showdown would not alter the course of the election, with Macron ahead in all previous polls.\n\nVoter surveys have shown a widening of Macron\u2019s lead over Le Pen to as much as 56%-44% since the first round on April 10, and analysts said the debate was unlikely to swing voting intentions in Le Pen\u2019s favour.\n\n\u201cYes, Emmanuel Macron won but his adversary has avoided a repeat of last time\u2019s disaster,\u201d Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador said on Twitter. \u201cThis debate doesn\u2019t disqualify her like the one in 2017, but it doesn\u2019t help her close the gap either.\u201d\n\nOn the offensive for most of the debate, Macron\u2019s most piercing line of attack was on a loan to Le Pen\u2019s party for her 2017 campaign contracted through a Russian bank.\n\n\u201cYou talk about your banker when you talk about Russia, that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Macron told his opponent. \u201cYou depend on Russian power, you depend on Mr. Putin.\u201d read more\n\nOn the cost of living, rated the most important issue for the French in this election, Macron also appeared to put Le Pen on the defensive, asking her why she had voted against his plans to cap electricity prices if she wanted to help hard-up workers.\n\nStill, during the debate Macron failed to dispel an image of haughtiness that has taken root during his presidency. He interrupted his rival repeatedly with lines like \u201cMrs Le Pen is much more disciplined than five years ago\u201d, and \u201cStop mixing everything up\u201d.\n\n\u201cMr Macron, stop lecturing me,\u201d Le Pen retorted. By contrast, she adopted a much more courteous and softer tone than in 2017, even going so far as to applaud Macron\u2019s diplomatic efforts to prevent war in Ukraine.\n\nAn Elabe snap opinion poll on each candidate\u2019s personal characteristics showed 50% of the French thought Macron had come across as arrogant during the debate, while only 16% thought Le Pen had.\n\nLe Pen also appeared marginally more in tune with regular citizens, with 37% of viewers saying she sounded closer to people\u2019s concerns, while only 34% thought Macron did.\n\nShe also delivered a memorable punchline, which may resonate with left-wing and younger voters who think Macron has not done enough to combat climate change, despite his early-mandate slogan \u201cMake our planet great again\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am not a climate sceptic, but you\u2019re a bit of a climate hypocrite,\u201d Le Pen quipped.\n\nBut Macron\u2019s mastery of policy details made him look more \u201cpresidential\u201d, the same Elabe poll showed, while she failed to convince a majority of viewers she was fit to govern.\n\n\u201cEach of them has a huge weakness,\u201d Bernard Sananes of pollster Elabe said. \u201cEmmanuel Macron is considered arrogant by more than one in two viewers. And Marine Le Pen remains scary for half of them.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged city of Mariupol on Thursday but instead to block it \u201cso that not even a fly comes through.\u201d\n\nHis defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the rest of the city beyond the sprawling Azovstal steel plant where Ukrainian forces were holed has been \u201cliberated\u201d \u2014 as Russian officials refer to areas of Ukraine they have seized. Putin hailed that as a \u201csuccess.\u201d\n\nBut leaving the plant in Ukrainian hands robs the Russians of the ability to declare complete victory in Mariupol, which has seen some of the most dramatic fighting of the war and whose capture has both strategic and symbolic importance.\n\nThe scale of suffering there has made it a worldwide focal point, and its definitive fall would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, complete a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and free up Russian troops to move elsewhere in the Donbas.\n\nShoigu said the plant was \u201csecurely blocked.\u201d\n\nPutin and Shoigu\u2019s comments appeared to reflect a change in strategy in Mariupol, where the Russians previously seemed determined to take every last inch of the city. But it was not clear what it would mean in practical terms.\n\nUkrainian officials did not comment on the latest remarks, but earlier said four buses with civilians managed to escape from the city after several unsuccessful attempts. Thousands more remain the city, much of which has been reduced to a smoking ruin in a nearly two-month siege, with over 20,000 people feared dead.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said another attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol would be made Thursday \u2014 though it was not clear how the latest comments would affect that.\n\nIn Kyiv, Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Denmark\u2019s Mette Frederiksen became the latest European leaders to show support with a visit to the capital. They were due to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in a video address overnight that the Russians were not \u201cabandoning their attempts to score at least some victory by launching a new, large-scale offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe West stands together to support the Ukrainian people,\u201d Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin said it submitted a draft of its demands for ending the war, and the West raced to supply Ukraine with heavier weapons to counter the Russians\u2019 new drive to seize the industrial east.\n\nBritain\u2019s Defense Ministry said in an assessment that Russia likely desires to demonstrate significant successes ahead of its annual May 9 Victory Day celebrations. \u201cThis could affect how quickly and forcefully they attempt to conduct operations in the run-up to this date.\u201d\n\nAs fears grew for the fate of civilians in Mariupol, the Kyiv regional police said Thursday that two mass graves with nine bodies were discovered in the city of Borodyanka, northwest of the capital. The findings added to thousands of civilians reported killed by Russian forces, who have been accused of wholesale abuses of Ukrainians.\n\nHead of the Kyiv regional police, Andriy Nebytov, said two women and a teenager were among the \u201ccivilians killed by the Russian occupiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to stress that these people are civilians. The Russian military deliberately shot civilians that didn\u2019t put up any resistance and didn\u2019t pose any threat,\u201d Nebytov said, adding that some of the victims were apparently tortured.\n\nWith global tensions running high, Russia reported the first successful test launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, the Sarmat. President Vladimir Putin boasted that it can overcome any missile defense system and make those who threaten Russia \u201cthink twice.\u201d The head of the Russian state aerospace agency called the launch out of northern Russia \u201ca present to NATO.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon described the test as \u201croutine\u201d and said it wasn\u2019t considered a threat.\n\nOn the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines. Russia said it launched hundreds of missile and air attacks on targets that included concentrations of troops and vehicles.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s stated goal is the capture of the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking eastern region that is home to coal mines, metal plants and heavy-equipment factories. Detaching it from the rest of Ukraine would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv.\n\nThe U.K. Defense Ministry said Russian forces were advancing from staging areas in the Donbas toward Kramatorsk, which continues to suffer from persistent rocket attacks.\n\nThe Luhansk governor said Russian forces control 80% of his region, which is one of two that make up the Donbas. Before Russia invaded on Feb. 24, the Kyiv government controlled 60% of the Luhansk region.\n\nGov. Serhiy Haidai said the Russians, after seizing the small city of Kreminna, are now threatening the cities of Rubizhne and Popasna. He urged all residents to evacuate immediately.\n\n\u201cThe occupiers control only parts of these cities, unable to break through to the centers,\u201d Haidai said on the messaging app Telegram.\n\nAnalysts have said the offensive in the east could become a war of attrition as Russia faces Ukraine\u2019s most experienced, battle-hardened troops, who have fought pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas for eight years.\n\nRussia said it presented Ukraine with a draft document outlining its demands for ending the conflict \u2014 days after Putin said the talks were at a \u201cdead end.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that \u201cthe ball is in their court, we\u2019re waiting for a response.\u201d He gave no details on the draft, and it was not clear when it was sent or whether it offered anything new to the Ukrainians, who presented their own demands last month.\n\nZelenskyy said he had not seen or heard of the proposal, though one of his top advisers said the Ukrainian side was reviewing it.\n\nMoscow has long demanded Ukraine drop any bid to join NATO. Ukraine has said it would agree to that in return for security guarantees from other countries. Other sources of tension include the status of both the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Moscow in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where the separatists have declared independent republics recognized by Russia.\n\nEarlier this week, Ukraine said the Russians dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of the Azovstal steel plant .\n\nA few thousand Ukrainian troops, by the Russians\u2019 estimate, remained in the plant and its labyrinth of tunnels and bunkers spread out across about 11 square kilometers (4 square miles). Zelenskyy said about 1,000 civilians were also trapped.\n\nA Ukrainian apparently in the plant posted a Facebook video urging world leaders to help evacuate people from the plant, saying, \u201cWe have more than 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians with us, including women and children.\u201d\n\nThe officer identified himself as Serhiy Volynskyy of the 36th Marine Brigade and warned: \u201cThis may be our last appeal. We may have only a few days or hours left.\u201d The authenticity of the video could not be independently verified.\n\nRussia has repeatedly issued ultimatums to the defenders to surrender, but the Ukrainians have ignored them.\n\nMore than 100,000 people overall were believed trapped in Mariupol with little if any food, water, medicine or heat. The city\u2019s pre-war population was 400,000.\n\nA Zelenskyy adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that he and other Ukrainian negotiators were ready to hold talks without conditions to save the lives of trapped Mariupol defenders and civilians. There was no immediate response from Russia.\n\nElsewhere, some residents of the eastern city of Kharkiv have lived in basements for weeks, trying to stay safe from Russian shelling. With no running water, gas or electricity, they collect rainwater and cook on open fires, burning debris from destroyed wooden buildings.\n\nIn one neighborhood, they sought safety in a school basement \u2014 using desks, tables and chairs to fashion beds. More than 300 people slept there during the first days of the war, but most have left for safer places, and only a few dozen remain.\n\nStirring a large pot of a thin vegetable soup, a woman said volunteers brought cabbage, beets and canned beans. \u201cWe mixed everything together and made borscht,\u201d said Natasha, who gave only her first name.\n\nAs Russia funneled troops and equipment into the Donbas, Western nations rushed to boost the flow of military supplies to Kyiv for this new phase of the war \u2014 likely to involve trench warfare, long-range artillery attacks and tank battles across relatively open terrain.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden was set to announce plans Thursday to send more military aid to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s Western allies have \u201ccome to understand our needs better,\u201d adding that Ukraine is receiving new shipments of Western weapons \u201cnow, when Russia is trying to step up its attacks, not in weeks or in a month.\u201d\n\nPutin, meanwhile, boasted that the Sarmat missile has \u201cno equivalents in the world.\u201d The Sarmat is intended to eventually replace the Soviet-built missile code-named Satan by NATO as a major component of Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt will \u201cmake those who, in the heat of frantic, aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country think twice,\u201d Putin said.\n\nNPR",
          "summary": "The findings added to thousands of civilians reported killed by Russian forces, who have been accused of wholesale abuses of Ukrainians.\nOn the battlefield, Ukraine said Moscow continued to mount assaults across the east, probing for weak points in Ukrainian defensive lines.\nDetaching it from the rest of Ukraine would give Putin a badly needed victory two months into the war, after the botched attempt to storm the capital, Kyiv.\nEarlier this week, Ukraine said the Russians dropped heavy bombs to flatten what was left of the Azovstal steel plant .\nIt will \u201cmake those who, in the heat of frantic, aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country think twice,\u201d Putin said.",

          "text": "The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has stated that a total of 15,225,627 travellers passed through Nigeria\u2019s airports in 2021.\n\nThis was an increase of 101.02 per cent in domestic and international travel when compared to 2020.\n\nThe data released by the NBS on Wednesday, stated that the figures were provided by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and verified and validated by the bureau.\n\nThe details showed that the total number of international passengers who passed through Nigerian airports was 2,219,146, as against 1,408,026 passengers in 2020.\n\nThis represented 57.61 per cent growth rate, while in 2021, the total number of domestic passengers who passed through Nigerian airports was 13,006,481 as against 9,069,295 in 2020, which also represented a 43.41 per cent growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, the data showed that the number of arrivals in 2021 stood at 6,533,740, which was higher compared to 4,870,072 in 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, departure stood at 6,472,741 in 2021 compared to 4,199,223 in 2020. Similarly, the total number of international passengers who passed through Nigerian airports were 2,219,146 in 2021 as against 1,408,026 passengers in 2020. This represented 57.61 per cent growth rate. Similarly, the number of arrivals in 2021 stood at 1,109,621, which was higher compared to 690,765 in 2020. Also, departure stood at 1,109,525 in 2021 compared to 717,261 in 2020.\n\nThe data showed that Abuja, Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Enugu and Owerri recorded the highest rate of traffic, while Katsina, Kaduna, Ibadan and Jos recorded the lowest traffic.\n\nA total of 4,758,843 passengers passed through the domestic terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, while 4,093,712 passengers passed through the domestic terminals of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. The domestic terminals of Port Harcourt International Airport had 900,728 passengers, Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (545,749) and Akanu Ibiam International Airport (508,513).\n\nOthers were Owerri (583,464) Benin Airport (433,017) Margaret Ekpo Airport (197,998) Yola (175,699) Maiduguri (197,898), Ilorin (148,109) Akure (113,625), Sokoto (137,511) Kaduna (73,110), Jos (57,020), Ibadan (51,172) and Katsina (30,313).\n\nFor foreign travel, Lagos recorded the highest traffic, with 1,595,522 passengers, while Abuja came second with 565,062 passengers. Port Harcourt had 14,519 passengers, while Kano had 39,441, Enugu had 4,532 and Maiduguri had 68.\n\nReacting to the significant increase in passenger traffic in 2021, the President of National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye said while COVID-19 initially stopped many people from traveling after the lockdown, it was also the major factor that made more people to travel later, as people who were locked down were eager to travel on business and pleasure.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 was a factor that brought down the passenger traffic in 2020 but it is also the reason it went up in 2021. COVID-19 protocol introduced by countries restricted many people from travelling because it was costly and inconveniencing but immediately countries began to lift COVID-19 protocol there was a surge in passenger traffic; people started travelling.\n\n\u201cDoing those tests was not funny, since you would spend almost the same amount you paid for airfare on tests. So that\u2019s why there is increase in air travel,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso the Regional Manager, South West in charge of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba told THISDAY that due to the lockdown in 2020, there was a record of low passenger throughput because people did not travel as much when the airports were reopened in September, 2020 but in 2021 more people travelled with the removal of COVID-19 restrictions, adding that there was increase in the number of people on international destinations because \u201ca lot of people are leaving the country.\u201d",

          "title": "Ex-NNPC GM Says Nigeria Could Have Saved $20bn by Deploying Technology to Tackle Oil Theft",
          "text": "A former Group General Manager in charge of Research and Development division at the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd., (NNPC), Mr Benjamin Obaigbena, on Wednesday called on the federal government to deploy technology in solving the perennial theft of the nation\u2019s crude oil.\n\nMaking his views known in a treatise, the ex-NNPC top shot estimated that Nigeria would have saved as much as $20 billion if it had deployed technology when the problem started years ago.\n\nHe expressed surprise that Nigeria has just woken up from what he described as its heavy inertia to know that the country is losing substantial volume of crude oil to oil theft and bunkering, insisting that the activities of the criminals are as old as the oil industry.\n\nObaigbena noted that Nigeria cannot claim ignorance of the astronomical volume of oil theft for the past 50 years, maintaining that it deliberately \u201clet loose the baby tiger into the wild\u201d which has now matured to a monstrous size and sophistication to evade being caught or detected.\n\nThe retired NNPC employee disclosed that if the federal government had heeded and implemented a presentation made years ago for the use of technology to solve the problem, the challenge would have been reduced to the barest minimum today.\n\nHe insinuated that because government officials are involved in the crime, the criminals are never caught or brought to justice for a long time since they have powerful links to high profile politicians in government protecting the common interests of parties involved.\n\nHe explained that in the year 2000, the NNPC made a very innovative and successful strategy to combat corruption at the depots nationwide, reduce pipeline vandalism and smuggling of petroleum products to the neighbouring countries.\n\nAccording to him, earlier, a think tank of NNPC then, the Consultancy Services Unit (CSU) based in Lagos proposed the use of technology to monitor the distribution of crude and product lines using the principles of Telemetry/ SCADA where NNPC could monitor real time distribution activities of the pipelines along the country\u2019s arteries of pipeline network.\n\nWith the deployment of this technology, he stressed that vandalism or pipeline break along the distribution lines would have been instantly detected with tell-tale blinking lights or audible alarm displaying the coordinates of the location on the screen.\n\nIn addition, he noted that the signal is immediately dispatched to the nearest military base for immediate dispatch of anti-terror personnel to swoop the area and contain the menace.\n\n\u201cThis idea was muted at the presentation venue and did not get to top management of NNPC at that time because of the associated high cost to deploy such technology.\n\n\u201c That costly decision to mute the idea did not consider the long term cost- benefit implications. If that technology was deployed at that material time, the country would have saved more than $20 billion or more to date. Apart from the long term cost saving, the technological experience in managing the pipeline surveillance and security over the years would have been extended to our railway and road networks for same purpose.\n\n\u201cThis 1995 technology has advanced to modern and faster technology with many adds ons (e.g. use of HD video cameras to capture footage needed in identifying and persecuting the criminal bunch in court, SMS, long distance drones, cloud storage, satellites, etc.).\n\n\u201cIt is still not too late if we prioritise the need to deploy this technology. The money to acquire this technology can be generated if we can significantly reduce the huge wastages from the three tiers of government which are too numerous to mention here. The government can reengineer its processes to save cost and improve efficiency in delivery of their goals,\u201d he advised.\n\nWhile calling for a close working relationship with the Research and Development division in the NNPC, Obaigbena stated that the UK Government had offered technical assistance to address the problem of illegally obtained crude oils in the Niger Delta in collaboration with the University of Plymouth.\n\nHe explained that when the study was completed, further works were necessary to identify Nigerian crude from a mixture (co-mingling) with other foreign crudes, stressing that the challenge was the immediate acquisition of more sophisticated analytical equipment to complete the investigation.\n\n\u201cNNPC R&D division made a presentation on this study (as promising tool to stop stealing of Nigerian crudes for easy detection anywhere in the world) to the office of Hon. Minister of Petroleum in 2013.\n\n\u201cA promise was made by the office to release $350,000 for immediate purchase of High Resolution Time-of Flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometers (GC-GC-TOF-MS) and Gas Chromatograhy Combustion Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS).\n\n\u201cThe purchase of the equipment did not see the light of the day and that was the constraint to conclude the high end research to establish a base to identify Nigerian stolen crude anywhere on this planet.\n\n\u201cIt is good to let Nigerians know that the NNPC R&D division was at the time (and may be till now) the most equipped laboratory in African continent with developed capabilities to carry out many complex oil and gas studies that were being done in overseas saving several millions of dollars,\u201d he declared.\n\nAccording to him, if the government means business to stop oil theft, it should invite NNPC R&D division, Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), multinational and national oil companies to meet and come up with solutions to put a final stop to the old problem that has wrecked the nation.\n\nHe advised that the local vigilante group can also be a useful catalyst in the drive for intelligence surveillance and information gathering, noting that it is long overdue to overhaul the security of Nigeria\u2019s national asset.\n\n\u201cIt is now time for the federal government to wake up, make an early morning call to challenge and push the intellectual community of our great nation to start solving national problems through aggressive research and innovation.\n\n\u201cNo nation on this planet thrives in this highly competitive age without a solid foundation in pure and applied research,\u201d he maintained.",
