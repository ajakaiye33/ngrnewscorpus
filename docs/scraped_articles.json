          "text": "By Sam Eyoboka\n\nTHE Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins has called on all Nigerians to celebrate the joy of Christmas and the birth of Jesus Christ, despite the insecurity and economic challenges in our country.\n\nIn his 2021 Christmas message titled, \u2018Joy to the world, the Lord is come\u2019, signed by the Director of Social Communications, Rev. Fr. Anthony Godonu, Archbishop Martins also encouraged all citizens to be grateful to God for the gift of life, and for the grace of surviving the numerous security challenges that have arisen in the outgoing year.\n\n\u201cBeing alive to witness yet another Christmas is a great gift from God that should never be taken for granted particularly in our present realities. We know that thousands who started this year with us are no longer here; having fallen victim to the endemic insecurity in the land caused by kidnappers, bandits, Boko Haram terrorists, COVID-19, amongst others.\n\n\u201cHaving come thus far, we must remain thankful and hopeful that the good Lord will sustain us to the end of this year and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile calling on all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious and tribal inclinations, to learn to live in peace, love and unity as exemplified by the life of Jesus Christ, he equally urged them to put aside their fears and open their minds and hearts to the beautiful message of the season.\n\n\u201cThe message of Christmas is a message of hope for everyone. The message that God loves us so much that He sent His only Son to redeem us and show us the way to the Father in heaven, should raise our hope that all is not lost despite all our problems\u201d he said.\n\nGod cares and is in control even if it is difficult to see.\n\nThe Archbishop also charged all Nigerians to offer all that is within their power in order to bring joy to people especially those in a state of despair. This should be the desire of everyone not only in this season but all the time.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must be generous to the less-privileged in our midst through our kind words of affirmation and offering the support that we can as our proclamation of the joyous tidings that \u2018God is with us.\u2019 By so doing, we will, in no small measure, help to dampen the wave of violence and hunger in our land, awaken hope in the hopeless, give water of life to the thirsty and food to the hungry as well as joy to those in distress. These are what God expects from us during this yuletide and beyond.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Prelate enjoined the Federal Government to redouble efforts in stemming the tide of insecurity in the country, particularly during the yuletide and New Year celebrations.\n\nIn the midst of insecurity and anxiety due to the killings, kidnappings etc, people must be able to see hope in the actions and policies of their governments.\n\nVANGUARD NEWS NIGERIA",

          "text": "\u2026Narrates how Akande ran to Obasanjo for help during Ife/Modakeke war\n\n\u2026Says Electoral Act remains our last opportunity to rebuild Nigeria\n\n\u2026Jandor\u2019s nice to PDP\u2019ll shake APC in Lagos\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\n\nChief Olabode George is the former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. In this interview, he speaks on the recent defections to the PDP in Lagos, the back and forth over the autobiography of former Osun State governor, Chief Bisi Akande, among other issues.\n\nYour party recently welcomed an APC faction in Lagos, what is the atmosphere like?\n\nWe welcomed a new infusion of massive decampees from the crumbling APC led by Mr. Abdulazeez Olajide Adediran popularly called Jandor and his followers who have decided to abandon the sinking and the blighted ship of the APC for a renewed, energized, invigorated, forward-looking PDP.\n\nLet it be known by all and sundry that the strength of all political parties resides precisely in their population. The more the merrier. A good political party does not turn people away. It embraces everyone who can contribute to the progress of the party.\n\nHow do you intend to manage the relationship between the new members and former members?\n\nFor those of us who are already in the People\u2019s Democratic Party in Lagos, let us welcome the new entrants with warm, open embrace. They are coming to add values to our party.\n\nWe know who the enemy is. We know those who are despoiling the riches of our state. We know the man who is carting away N9 billion every 30 days from our collective coffers.\n\nThere is no need for unnecessary enmity. There is no need to feel threatened about our new members. We must work together to achieve victory. Everyone will be given a level playing ground to achieve their aspirations. Politics is always a game of number. We can only strengthen ourselves when we embrace and encourage those who are joining our team and sincerely work with them to take our state back from the prodigal mis- managers.\n\nDo you think Jandor will be accepted\u2026\n\nI believe our people will troop out in their thousands to welcome Mr. Adediran and his followers when they make their official declaration in January.\n\nNo one should feel threatened about the people who are joining us. The umbrella is big enough to give us all effective protection and salvaging refuge.\n\nWhat is your take on the Electoral Act\u2026\n\nAs we will be entering a new season of campaign in the next few months, I will be remissed if I fail to mention the very pivotal new bill presently on the President\u2019s table. The direct primary bill which was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate will not only deepen our democratic process, it will basically remove power from the back-room leaders and hand true power to the people. It is a great opportunity for President Muhammodu Buhari to ensure a great place for himself in the pantheon of our democratic heroes. He should sign this bill and the electronic transfer of result bill.\n\nINEC has already assured Nigerians that they are willing and capable to adopt these innovations. Mr. President must never lose this opportunity to reclaim the moral high ground in the history of our nation.\n\nDemocracy is about the people\u2019s will, the People\u2019s voice, the collective participation in the guidance of the state. It is never about a privileged few determining the fate of the nation in some This nation will be on the right path of redemption and genuine harmony when power truly resides in the people. That is now our national challenge to a better, more peaceful and progressive nation. It is our road to liberation from the scourge of bandits, the rampage of terrorists, the savagery of sundry criminals and the recklessness of bullion van pseudo democrats.\n\nThis may be our last opportunity to rebuild a genuine, fair and just nation that generations yet unborn will be proud of. Let Mr. President begin that process now. Let him lead this cause. History will be kind to him if he stands with the people.\n\nAs the Atona Oodua of Yorubaland, are you not worried about the tension the autobiography of former governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande, has generated?\n\nI want to plead and beg Baba Adebanjo, the man is 93 and people are throwing tantrums and Akande is about 83 that is 10 years different and you are firing on all cylinders, for what. Let Chief Akande remember that there is the younger generation who are watching. That is not the proper record to leave for them.\n\nChief Akande is older than me but I will say it in a milder form that that kind of attitude is not acceptable. Do you think the people in the north don\u2019t fight and have differences? Do you think people in the east don\u2019t fight and have differences? Baba Akande must apologize openly. Some people are reacting, in fact, Baba Falae was so angry and he said he was going to take his time to talk to them. But I want to plead with Baba Falae that this is the time for sobering.\n\nAnd you know the worst thing is that of all those statements he made, he was now praising Bola Tinubu. The question I want to ask Baba Akande directly is that is Bola Tinubu from Lagos? Why are you afraid to tell the people of your origin where you came from? Now, you want to be the president of this country but your identities are not clear. Even if he donated any kobo towards the building, is this the time to be saying it? Did Adebanjo force him to do it? It shows you have no class. You are not cultured.\n\nHow do you think the impasse generated by the book can be resolved?\n\nI want to plead with Baba Akande, unfortunately, it was not just a statement, it was a book. That book should be condemned outrightly shredded into the dustbin of history because of the fallacies, inaccuracies and lies. It is most unfair. I had a cordial relationship with him when he was governor because when Ife and Modakeke were burning, he ran to Baba Obasanjo for help. I\u2019m not from Osun and so I said I would need somebody knowledgeable about the state to work with and he gave me a very brilliant guy beyond my comprehension that can really educate me about the problems between Ife people and Modakeke.\n\nThe man was straightforward and we worked together and God favoured that knowledge. Since then, there has been no crisis between Ife and Modakeke. We did our best and everything went well.\n\nBy the final day, we went to the Villa, Baba Obasanjo sat, the Ooni and all the elders on both sides were there, we presented the report, defended the report and then they accepted it. So that is the kind of legacy Baba Akande should leave behind but from this book, you can see all the fireworks from all sides. At 83, what are you looking for? I want to plead because I know Chief Falae, when he talks and when he writes so that he doesn\u2019t open up another can of worms because it will be worse than the nuclear bomb.",

          "text": "\u2018Monarch accused me of being too stingy with money\u2019\n\nAs governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande had problems with the immediate past Ooni of Ife, Oba Okuade Sijuwade, and the Owa-Obokun of Ijeshaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\nAkande, in his book, \u2018My Participations\u2019, said the late Sijuwade wanted him to plunge the state into debt by taking a loan for a water project the Oba had an\n\ninterest in.\n\nHe also said Oba Aromolaran was always saying bad things about him because of his belief that he was stingy.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that most of the obas did not want to associate with the Owa-Obokun, His Majesty, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\n\u201cOne day he came to me to complain that he had no car. I told him that Osun State had no money now to buy cars for traditional rulers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cBut his pestering was too much and I secretly sent money to him to buy a car.\n\n\u201cI went to meet him at his palace in Ilesha and told him that he should use the money I sent to buy a car. He then called Lere Adebayo.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know how much of the money he should return to me! Lere then told him, \u2018Don\u2019t try that with Akande o! Ajemonu tie niyen!!\u2019\n\n\u201cMaybe that was the practice before my time. A few weeks after that incident, the Commissioner of Police was changed and the new man was touring the state and when he got to Ilesha, the Owa called him aside.\n\n\u201cHe told the CP that the only person he should be careful of within the state was Governor Akande. \u2018He is too stingy with money,\u2019 Kabiyesi said. The Commissioner of Police reported to me.\n\n\u201cSo one day the Owa came again to report to me Mr Niran Fajuke, the chairman of the local government in Ilesha. He complained that Fajuke was not taking good care of him.\n\n\u201cI accused him, saying, \u2018Baba, you too are not sometimes a nice person. Even after I gave you money secretly to buy a car, you still told the new Commissioner of Police that I was dangerous and stingy!\u2019\n\n\u201cOn another day, I met Owa alongside Rauf Aregbesola in Bola Tinubu\u2019s house at Bourdillon and tried to warn Aregbesola to be careful with Owa Aromolaran. Among the Obas and chiefs, the Owa seemed unpopular,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Owa had a long-standing grudge against Ooni Sijuwade who wanted to dominate the entire space.\n\n\u201cOoni wanted to make an entourage of the smaller obas with a view to tormenting the Owa and other obas who might be opposed to him. He would give them money.\n\n\u201cWhat worried me with bringing the smaller obas into the Council of Obas to make them have an equal ranking with the other paramount rulers was that it might undermine the age-old tradition of the Yoruba people.\n\n\u201cAs far as my government was concerned, only three obas were paramount in Osun State: The Ooni, the Orangun and the Owa,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added that when his old boss at BP, the Ajalorunof Ijebu-Ife, Ogun State, wanted to honour him with the traditional title of Jagunmolu Oodua, the late Ooni opposed it.\n\n\u201cHe wrote him a letter insisting that he being the Arole Oodua, was the only one who could confer a title with the word \u2018Oodua\u2019 as part of its name.\n\n\u201cHe warned that if Oba Oguntayo should go ahead he would incur the wrath of the Yoruba deities. The Ajalorun wisely went ahead and I received the title. The Ajalorun has been waxing stronger since then.\n\n\u201cThe Ajalorun is one of the most ancient of Yoruba traditional thrones and like all other leading obas, the throne originated from the House of Oduduwa in lle-Ife.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ijebu-Ife is regarded as a replica of the old Ile-Ife. But the problem I had with the Ooni was more serious and graver and it also had to do with money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the late Ooni wanted him to renew the Ede-Osogbo Waterworks which was to be repaired with $300 million.\n\nHe refused to sanction the deal.",

You know that Bola Ige too was my friend! What happened was very unfortunate!\u201d\n\nHe also relived how he heard of the incident: \u201cIn the evening of December 23, 2001, I returned from a trip to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI was met at the Murtala International Airport by a team of top officials from Osun State, including my Attorney General, Dr Yemi Adedeji and Sola Akinwumi, the SSG.\n\n\u201cI drove in my car with Akinwumi and we headed for Osogbo. We took the old road from Ibadan, passing Iwo to Osogbo.\n\n\u201cWe had passed Iwo and getting close to Osogbo when Akinwumi\u2019s phone rang. Muyiwa Ige was on the other end.\n\n\u201cAkinwumi was just shouting Ah! Ah! Ah!! Then, the line went off. \u2018Uncle Bola has been killed!\u2019 Akinwumi announced flatly when he finally gathered himself.\n\n\u201cI was in shock! I did not know what to do. For the second time in my life, I had suddenly become an orphan again.\n\n\u201cIge was more than a political mentor to me. He was my uncle, my friend, my confidant.\n\n\u201cHis loyalty was total and his love was deep and profound. For me, he was irreplaceable.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWhen we arrived at the Government House, I gathered my entourage together and broke the tragic news to them.\n\n\u201cThere was an uproar \u2013 groaning and moaning and general confusion. Someone suggested we should pray.\n\n\u201cWe bowed down our heads and prayed. By the time the prayer ended, I noticed that the Commissioner of Police was now with us.\n\n\u201cHe had walked into the centre gingerly and was now standing close to me. Before we greeted, his phone started ringing. He gave me the phone.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obasanjo on the other end.\n\nIt occurred to me that what concerned the President more was not to arrest the assassins of his friend, but to prevent social unrest and calm the nerves of the populace.\n\n\u201cI told him we would take all necessary measures to prevent a breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cI sent messages to traditional rulers and other leaders that night\u2026\u201d",

That didn\u2019t make me to have a change of opinion about Obasanjo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything genuine about him despite his self-glorification,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe claimed the ex-president\u2019s nationalism and patriotism were fake, adding that his ambition to be the centre of Nigeria\u2019s universe made him express constant hatred for the late Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIt was this vaunting ambition that made him express constant hatred to the most altruistic and selfless leader of our time, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cHe continues to wonder till tomorrow why the Yoruba people, especially after his tour of duty as a two-time President, continue to elevate Awolowo to the highest pedestal while they have no respect for him. So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

He said I should look for someone else and after my second term, we would think of the next step,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe added that Tinubu said after the election, Aregbesola would come to learn more about Osun and its politics.\n\n\u201cSo, he chose Sooko Adewoyin, an elderly and experienced person from Ile Ife who was introduced to him by Prince Peter Ogunleye as his deputy.\n\n\u201cAt the appointed time, Rauf indeed came to Osun and he proved equal to the task, becoming the first Governor of Osun State to spend full two terms,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Henry Uche\n\nSenators may today draw battlelines with President Muhammadu Buhari over the veto of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nMajority of them want to press for the overriding of the president\u2019s veto, in exercise of the National Assembly\u2019s power to overrule the president on passed bills.\n\nPresident Buhari had withheld assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill, which the National Assembly sent to him on November 19, 2021.\n\nAs exclusively reported by The Sun on December 9, the president, in a letter to the National Assembly leadership, said he was withholding assent over the provision on direct primaries by political parties as the only means of selecting candidates for election.He said its adoption would increase the cost of elections as well as infringe on the rights of citizens.\n\nHe also cited insecurity as another reason for withholding assent to the bill, which has as its major highlight the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nCompetent sources at the Senate told Daily Sun that senators were not happy that President Buhari vetoed the Electoral Bill and want the upper legislative chamber to override his veto and pass the bill into law with two-thirds majority as required by the constitution. The Senate needs the \u201cYes\u201d votes of 73 lawmakers to override the veto and pass the Electoral Bill into law.\n\nIt was gathered that the aggrieved senators said they would not discuss the 2022 budget, which was to be passed yesterday, except the senate took a final decision on the Electoral Bill by allowing them to vote for the overriding of the president\u2019s veto.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that between yesterday\u2019s morning and evening, 81 senators had signed for the overriding of the president veto. These included senators who attended plenary and those absent but who sent in their positions via phone messages.\n\nSeventy-one senators signed the document, while 10 sent phone messages to support the plan to override the President\u2019s veto, it was gathered.\n\nIt was learnt that Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, was not comfortable with the move to override President Buhari\u2019s veto and is believed to be devising strategy to frustrate the plot.\n\nOne of the strategies he may adopt, it was learnt, is open voting on the floor today, believing that such process may make senators to chicken out of the plan.\n\nThe senators, however, are insisting that there would be no need to vote on the floor since they had already signed a document on their position to override the president\u2019s veto.\n\nIt was,however, learnt that the Senate president has rejected the \u201cvote\u201d via phone messages by senators who were absent in yesterday\u2019s plenary, insisting that only the position of those present would be considered.\n\nSources told Daily Sun that the Senate could not close plenary for the year yesterday as earlier scheduled because of senators\u2019 insistence that President Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Bill must be discussed before they go on recess. They senators also refused to discuss and pass the 2022 budget as earlier scheduled.\n\nIt is believed that the Senate would go on recess today after discussing and perhaps taking a vote on President Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Bill. The House of Representatives has already gone on recess till January next year.\n\n\u2022Reps\u2019ll revisit electoral bill next year \u2013 Gbajabiamila\n\nHowever, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, has said the House of Representatives would revisit the Electoral Act Amendment when it resumes from Christmas vacation on January 2022.\n\nHe stated this while addressing members at the last plenary for this year.\n\nGbajabiamila said the House when it resumes would continue efforts to reform the electoral process, saying that is what Nigerians expect from the parliament.\n\n\u201cThis year, despite the differences of opinions, all of us in the House of Representatives and indeed the entire National Assembly, worked to pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. We included in that bill, provisions we hope will significantly enhance the conduct of our national elections and improve public confidence in our electoral outcomes. As it is now, that bill has not received presidential assent, and it falls on parliament to decide the best way forward.\n\n\u201cWhen we return in the New Year, we will resume our efforts to reform the electoral system in our country. And we will do it together. That is what the Nigerian people expect of us, and we will do our duty for God and country. Whichever way it pans out, we must not throw out the baby with the bath water and must deliver a credible and enduring electoral system to Nigerians. Every law is a living document and as long as it has breath, it must survive,\u201d he said.\n\nMinority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, speaking under matters of privilege, had implored the House to immediately remove the contentious clause and resend it the president for assent.\n\nElumelu had argued that time was of essence in the quest by the National Assembly to give the country a new electoral law ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nGbajabiamila, in his response, said since the country operates a bicameral legislature, whatever the House intends to do must be in sync with Senate for it to be effective.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re not scared of direct primaries \u2013 NGF\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has said contrary to perceptions, neither President Buhari nor governors were scared of direct primaries.\n\nFayemi, who was responding to questions from State House Correspondents after a meeting with the president, dismissed suggestions that the president had succumbed to their pressure by declining assent to the bill, noting that governors do not care whether the mode of primaries is direct or indirect.\n\nWhen told that governors were happy because President Buhari did not sign the bill over the mandatory direct primaries, Fayemi argued: \u201cOkay, well, I don\u2019t know what you mean by governor\u2019s being happy. At least as the governor who has gone through a series of elections, my election to office during my first term was via a direct primary that took place in all the 177 wards in my state. And my election to my second term in office was via an indirect primary.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve tasted both and I can tell you that it really doesn\u2019t matter to any governor whether you have primaries via direct mode or an indirect mode. What is governors\u2019 interest and concern is that opportunities are given for an inclusive process. And I think that is what Mr. President\u2019s letter has brought out.\n\n\u201cMr. President has not objected to direct primaries, neither has he endorsed indirect primaries. He has only said, be fair to all, let all options apply and what you decide should be determined by your own local and peculiar circumstances. Being mindful of questions of security, finances, and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we all should commend the courage of Mr. President to stand with the people. And the President, you know, just like me, is not afraid of whatever mode you you decide to use.\n\n\u201cWhen I chaired the primaries, the historic primaries that brought him in as a presidential candidate, I was the chair of that primaries in 2014, it was an indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cBut in 2019, when he was coming back, he came back via a direct primary. So, Mr. President has also tasted both. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s somebody to be lectured about the pros and cons of either processes.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is to ensure that whatever process you choose in your particular circumstance still provides a process that is as free a manner as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not completely free process, but at least there is something that is called substantial compliance in electoral law. And if it meets substantial compliance, I think all of us should be happy with that. We shouldn\u2019t really dwell too much on\u2026there\u2019s been this exaggerated expectation that direct primaries is going to provide all answers to whatever electoral challenges that we have faced.\n\n\u201cAnd we all know that that is false. Direct primaries has its own challenges, indirect primaries has its own challenges, a consensus approach is also not without challenges but options should be provided.\n\n\u2022CUPP tasks NASS\n\nThe Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has charged the National Assembly to expunge direct primaries from the Bill and return same to President Buhari for his assent.\n\nIts spokesman, Ikenga Ugochinyere, appealed to members of the National Assembly to cancel their Christmas break so as to enable them rework the Bill, immediately, in the interest of the country.\n\n\u201cIf the issue of direct and indirect primary is why the president failed to sign the electoral law, let parliament expunge that area and retransmit the remaining one to him. Let us see the reason he would use in not signing it again.\n\n\u201cIf the parliament was responsive, there is no need of going on recess at a time like this. All that is required to do is just one or two sittings and the amendment would be made and transmitted back to the president for assent. I can tell you that what the president is running away from is not the argument of direct or indirect primary but the president is scared that if he conduct an election with electronic voting system, his party would lose election.\u201d\n\n\u2022Override veto or leave in perpetual shame, Ozekhome to NASS\n\nSenior lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, also threw a challenge to the National Assembly to override the president\u2019s veto and pass the bill into law, using section 58 (5) of the 1999 constitution.\n\nIn a monitored interview, Ozekhome said he was not surprised that the president declined his assent to the bill. He said he had earlier challenged the president in a public forum to surprise him and many other Nigerians who knew ab initio that he would not sign the bill, saying his expectation in this regard was not dashed.\n\nOzekhome said history beckons on the lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives to give Nigerians a Christmas present by getting two-third majority in a joint session to pass the bill into law in the interest of Nigerians. He warned that Nigerians would hold the lawmakers responsible if things deteriorate politically, economically and otherwise in the years ahead as a result of the non-passage of the electoral amendment bill.",

          "text": "\u2022 Over 75 Senators sign proposal, more expected\n\nDeji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nNigerians have not heard the last of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to assent to the 2021 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, as the senate, yesterday, showed readiness for a showdown with the executive over the matter and immediately moved to override the president.\n\nAlthough the situation in the House of Representatives, was not as heated as the Senate, the House leadership said, while the bill might not have received presidential assent, it was within the responsibility of the parliament to decide the best way forward, adding that it would resume efforts to reform the electoral system next year.\n\nTHISDAY, however, learnt that over 75 senators had already signed a proposal, as at yesterday evening, indicating a commitment to override Buhari\u2019s veto of the electoral bill, which would be introduced as a motion.\n\nBuhari\u2019s letter was read at the start of plenary by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, after the upper chamber came out from a closed session, which lasted some 40 minutes.\n\nIn the letter, the president explained that his decision to withhold assent to the electoral bill was informed by advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government after a thorough review.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primaries to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, signing the bill into law would have serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences on the country, particularly, in view of Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities. He also said any attempt to impose direct primaries on the political parties would be undemocratic.\n\nBuhari further noted that such imposition would negatively affect the rights of citizens to participate in government as constitutionally guaranteed.\n\nThis is the second time the president would be withholding assent to the electoral bill, the first being during the Eighth National Assembly in 2018, when he said the passage of the bill by the then National Assembly was too close to the 2019 general election.\n\nTwo closed-door sessions held at yesterday\u2019s plenary was said to be inconclusive, as senators, reportedly, threatened to invoke the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to veto the president\u2019s position at Wednesday\u2019s plenary.\n\nApprehensive of possible outbursts from senators on the president\u2019s veto and, apparently, to prevent open opposition to Buhari\u2019s communication to the senate, Senate President Ahmed Lawan called for an executive session at 10:44am, which lasted an hour. Again, midway into the plenary, Senator George Sekibo (Rivers East) cited Order 14 of the Senate Standing Rules for the senate to go into another round of closed-door session, which Lawan upheld.\n\nSekibo was said to have used the opportunity of the closed-session to vent his anger over the decision of Buhari to turn down the signing of the Electoral Bill after the two chambers of the National Assembly had dully passed it.\n\nIt was further gathered that, at a point, the second closed-door session became rowdy, when some senators suggested that the veto should be upturned, while some others tried to prevail on them not to take the matter too far.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that more senators were in support of the plan to override the president, because it had become a fierce battle for their political survival in their respective states, where governors had become their arch-rivals.\n\nIt was learnt that the reason for the executive sessions was to enable the senators to resolve some contentious issues, including the electoral bill, so that they would not openly confront themselves at plenary.\n\nSpeaking after yesterday\u2019s plenary, Sekibo confirmed that senators were ready to override Buhari\u2019s decision at today\u2019s plenary. He also stated that his colleagues were being mobilised ahead of the plenary today, adding that many senators have already signed the veto notice.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy law, we have the power to override him. That\u2019s what Section 58 (4 & 5) of the 1999 Constitution says. We will use our powers to do it. And they are saying that people must be present at voting.\n\n\u201cOur rule gives us three methods of voting. Voice vote, by signing the document (signature), and electronic voting. So, we can use anyone. We collected signatures in the chamber and it cuts across party lines.\u201d\n\nSenator Abba Morro also faulted the president\u2019s reason for rejecting the bill saying, \u201cThe reasons given by the president to withhold assent, to my view and the views of majority of senators, are not enough, because all stakeholders have acknowledged the fact that the amended electoral act, as it is today, contains fantastic provisions that could deepen democracy.\n\n\u201cIf we reject the amended electoral bill because of direct primary, then, it will be very unfortunate. If it\u2019s because of direct primary, the president rejected the will of the people, I can assure you that myself and my colleagues are prepared this time around to override the president.\u201d\n\nOther senators, who also spoke, but on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that it was the plan of the lawmakers to override the veto on Tuesday, but it was scuttled by some of their colleagues, who considered it an embarrassment to the president, and would not allow it to happen.\n\nOne of the senators said, \u201cYes, our initial plan was to override President Buhari\u2019s veto on the electoral bill, but they truncated it in the process. So, we will come back on Wednesday and continue from where we stopped.\u201d\n\nAnother senator explained that he and his colleagues were out to override the president, but the senate president started saying it was not a just cause.\n\nYet, another senator, when asked whether or not there was a plan to override Buhari, responded, \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to do,\u201d adding that of all APC senators present yesterday, only three did not sign. But he was optimistic they would sign today.\n\nOn whether there was need to carry the House of Representatives members along, a ranking senator said, \u201cWe have a majority of willing team in the House of Representatives, because the idea of the direct primaries emanated from the lower chamber and it was sold to us in the senate.\u201d\n\nBut the Speaker, while reading his remarks at the last plenary of the year, said, \u201cThis year, despite the differences of opinions, all of us in the House of Representatives and indeed, the entire National Assembly, worked to pass the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill. We included in that bill, provisions we hoped will significantly enhance the conduct of our national elections and improve public confidence in our electoral outcomes.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, that bill has not received presidential assent, and it falls to parliament to decide the best way forward. When we return in the New Year, we will resume our efforts to reform the electoral system in our country. And we will do it together. That is what the Nigerian people expect of us, and we will do our duty for God and country.\n\n\u201cWhichever way it pans out, we must not throw out the baby with the bath water and must deliver a credible and enduring electoral system to Nigerians. Every law is a living document and as long as it has breath, it must survive.\u201d\n\nHe assured Nigerians that the House would pass Appropriation Bill 2022 yesterday, in keeping with the new tradition of operating an annual national budget from January to December.\n\nGbajabiamila said the ninth National Assembly, with each budget cycle, sought to improve the appropriations process to ensure more effective and efficient allocation and use of national resources.\n\nHe noted that the recurring challenge was how best to ensure that the ministries, departments and agencies of the federal government adhere strictly to the appropriation law.\n\nThis, the speaker noted, was of grave concern, especially, now that the country must contend with the reality of limited resources amid significant developmental challenges.\n\n\u201cHowever, one thing that is now abundantly clear, is that the legislature needs to act to reform the envelope system currently in place, because it imposes conditions that do not make for optimal outcomes.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we must begin also to consider options for merging agencies, where there is a significant overlap in functions and responsibilities, and scrapping other institutions, where their utility is no longer apparent,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the House has adjourned till January and promised to revisit the matter when it reconvenes, it has also said it would recall its members immediately, if the senate overrides the president.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022CSOs sad, want parliament to overrule Buhari\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and\n\nJuliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nChairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom, have reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal of assent to the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill, saying the decision was in the interest of the people.\n\nFayemi, however, denied insinuations that they were behind the president\u2019s rejection of the bill, saying they were not afraid of direct primaries.\n\nFayemi, who spoke with newsmen yesterday after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja, dismissed insinuations that the president had danced to the governors\u2019 tune by declining assent to the bill. He said the governors did not care whether the mode of primaries was direct or indirect.\n\nThe NGF chairman said as someone, who had gone through both systems during his first and second primary elections to pick his party\u2019s tickets, he was comfortable with any of the modes chosen. He, however, observed that by declining assent, Buhari stood on the side of the people, as he was neither for nor against direct primaries but wanted all options provided for, adding that the president\u2019s courage must be commended for standing on the side of the people.\n\nFayemi stated, in answer to a question, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean by governor\u2019s being happy. At least, as the governor, who has gone through a series of elections, my election to office during my first term was via a direct primary that took place in all the 177 wards in my state. And my election to my second term in office was via an indirect primary.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve tasted both. And I can tell you that it really doesn\u2019t matter to any governor whether you have primaries via direct mode or an indirect mode. What\u2019s governors\u2019 interest and concern is that opportunities are given for an inclusive process. And I think that is what Mr. President\u2019s letter has brought out.\n\n\u201cMr. President has not objected to direct primaries, neither has he endorsed indirect primaries. He has only said, be fair to all; let all options apply and what you decide should be determined by your own local and peculiar circumstances, being mindful of questions of security, finances, and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we all should commend the courage of Mr. President to stand with the people. And the president, you know, just like me, is not afraid of whatever mode you decide to use. When I chaired the primaries, the historic primaries that brought him in as a presidential candidate, I was the chair of that primaries in 2014, it was indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cBut in 2019, when he was coming back, he came back via a direct primary. So, Mr. President has also tasted both. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s somebody to be lectured about the pros and cons of either processes. What is important is to ensure that whatever process you choose in your particular circumstance still provides a process that is as free in a manner as possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not completely free process, but at least there is something that is called substantial compliance in electoral law. And if it meets substantial compliance, I think all of us should be happy with that. We shouldn\u2019t really dwell too much on it. There\u2019s been this exaggerated expectation that direct primaries is going to provide all answers to whatever electoral challenges that we have faced.\n\n\u201cAnd we all know that that is false. Direct primary has its own challenges, indirect primary has its own challenges, a consensus approach is also not without challenges, but options should be provided. That\u2019s all I think Mr. President has said and whether governors are happy or not, it\u2019s really immaterial to governors whether it\u2019s direct or indirect.\u201d\n\nFayemi said he was at the Villa as Chairman of NGF to brief the Buhari on issues concerning the states and commend him for trying to stem insecurity in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s customary, I mean, as Chairman of the Nigerian governors, to always exchange notes with Mr. President from time to time, especially, in the yuletide season like this, I always find time to come and say hello to Mr. President.\n\n\u201cBut yes, there will always be issues to discuss between the sub-nationals and the president of the federal republic, to commend him for his efforts in trying to stem the tide of insecurity in our country, and to also deal with the economic challenges that we are confronted with.\n\n\u201cOn our part as governors, we have had cause during the year to raise issues about insecurity in various domains. We have had cause to raise issues about economic challenges that the country is experiencing; we have had cause to raise other governance-related issues.\n\n\u201cAnd Mr. President has responded to many of those issues, he has stepped in the bridge, he has assisted us as states, even most recently, he had supported as with bridge finance, to address some of the economic difficulties that states are experiencing. And it\u2019s always appropriate to express our gratitude, even if we continue to raise concerns about aspects of our governance that we still want him to do more on.\u201d\n\nAsked what the president felt about his visit, Fayemi said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s always enlightening to meet with the president, as you know. I came to see the president in my capacity as the chairman of the Nigerian governors and to express, as I said, gratitude for his approval of the bridge finance, and also to let him know some of the steps we are taking in our various states to also fundamentally address this lack of revenue, because we have a challenge in this country, and tokenistic support will not do what the federal government does not have the resources to, neither do we have the resources in our various states.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to look for creative measures that would allow us to be able to raise funds that we can use to tackle the challenges of the moment \u2013 the challenge of infrastructure gap, the challenge of educational inequalities of our children that are out of school in parts of the country, the challenge of security.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have the resources, we would continue to have difficulties in managing people\u2019s expectations. And the truth of the matter is, the country is not as buoyant as most people think it is. And one of our suggestions to Mr. President is clearly that we need to create the enabling environment that will give those who can provide such support for the country the confidence to want to invest in the future of Nigeria. Those are the things that I discussed with Mr. President.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ortom, a member of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who spoke yesterday in Makurdi, said the National Assembly needed to reconsider the direct primaries clause in the bill.\n\nCommending Buhari for refusing assent to the electoral bill, Ortom stressed that the electronic transmission of results would deepen democracy and add value to the electoral system.\n\nCSOs Sad, Want Parliament to Override Buhari\n\nCivil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the country expressed sadness and disappointment at President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to withhold assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. They, therefore, called on the National Assembly to override the president\u2019s veto in the next 30 days.\n\nThe CSOs recommended to the legislature what to do, In a statement signed by Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS), Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF), and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe National Assembly, as a matter of national emergency, should either override the president\u2019s decision or remove the contentious clause (s) from the bill and transmit the bill back to the president for assent within the next 30 days.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should ensure that all clerical, editorial, and cross-referencing gaps in the current bill are resolved before transference back to the president.\n\n\u201cThe president should expeditiously assent to the revised bill upon receipt from the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cCivil society groups, media, and development partners must sustain the effort to protect the will of the people and safeguard the electoral reform process from policy capture and manipulation.\u201d\n\nThey said what was more disappointing was the fact that the president delayed his response until the effluxion of time required for assenting to the legislation, the date the National Assembly was proceeding on the Christmas and New Year holiday.\n\nAccording to the CSOs, \u201cThe president\u2019s decision to withhold assent to the bill will have serious implication for INEC as it prepares for the FCT Area Council election, the Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, and, ultimately, the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe non-conclusion of the electoral amendment process will mean that these elections will be conducted using the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), denying INEC the opportunity to test the efficacy of some of the new innovations introduced in the proposed Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is apart from the delay the commission will have to contend with in the required effort to review its guidelines, regulations and manuals in accordance with certain provisions of the bill.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, based on the revised timelines for specific electoral activities in the bill, INEC and other stakeholders will have to grapple with logistical, financial, and programmatic difficulties in the run-up to the 2023 general election. We reckon that this may not bode well for Nigeria\u2019s electoral democracy, hence the clamour for the speedy conclusion of the electoral reform process.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says the only repentant bandit is the dead one\n\n\u2022House urges IG, service chiefs to end banditry in state\n\nDeji Elumoye and\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has declared that his government has no other considerations for captured bandits, except to send them back to God to answer for their activities against humanity. El-Rufai also expressed concern about the inability of the security agencies to access the locations of the bandits troubling his state. He said these issues informed his visit to the State House, Abuja, yesterday to meet President Muhammadu Buhari and avail him details of the security situation in his state, where terrorists killed some 40 persons a few days ago.\n\nIn a similar vein, the House of Representatives urged the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, and the service chiefs to intensify operations to eradicate the activities of bandits and restore normalcy, especially, in Giwa/Birnin-Gwari Federal Constituency of Kaduna State.\n\nBriefing newsmen after his meeting with Buhari, el-Rufai said people who engaged in terrorism or banditry never ever repented, but could only be stopped by death. He added that his government was convinced it was its duty to end the reign of terror by dispatching terrorists to meet their Creator.\n\nRegarding his position on repentant bandits, el-Rufai said, \u201cThere is nothing like repentant terrorists (or bandits). The only repentant bandit is the one that is dead. Our intention in the state is to kill them (bandits/terrorists), let them go and see God.\u201d\n\nExplaining that care must be taken in dealing with bandits to avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians, he said, \u201cThere was a problem. Even if you know where the bandits are, you don\u2019t want to go and bomb all of them, because they may have civilians in custody. You may have collateral damage. And without the declaration of bandits as terrorists, it might even be referred to as abuse of their human rights.\u201d\n\nThe governor, however, said the recent declaration of bandits by the Federal High Court as terrorists had provided an avenue to fight them without limits.\n\n\u201cSo, no one will be dragged to the international court, because you killed bandits. No,\u201d he said, emphasising that Kaduna State would not negotiate with bandits, as its policy was to kill them all.\n\nOn the nomenclature of the criminals, the governor stated emphatically, \u201cThey are bandits. If you want to call them terrorists you can call them terrorists, but we don\u2019t want to confuse them with terrorists that we know, the Boko Haram. IPOB has been declared terrorists. We don\u2019t call them terrorists, we call them IPOB. The nomenclature doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that they are now fair game for the armed forces.\n\n\u201cOnce you say banditry of whatever description has been designated terrorists, that\u2019s it. That gives the military the power to do what they do. What we call them is not important. What they are called does not matter, but it is the legal status of being declared terrorists that matters. The legal status is that they have been declared terrorists but which terrorists? There are many terrorists in Nigeria. Boko Haram are terrorists. Ansaru are terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe ones that we have in Kaduna are bandits that have now been declared terrorists. These are people that rob, they kill, they kidnap for ransom. We call them bandits to differentiate them from the rest but they are terrorists.\u201d\n\nHe called for more military operations, adding that the security agencies have been overstretched, with their involvement in operations in virtually all parts of the country.\n\nOn whether the security forces lacked the requisite intelligence to be ahead of the bandits, el-Rufai said, \u201cYes, we receive security reports, we know a lot about the bandits and where they are and their activities.\n\n\u201cBut you must understand that the intelligence has to be acted upon. And if the security forces are unwilling or unable to reach the locations where these bandits are, then, there is nothing we can do as a state government.\n\n\u201cFederal security forces are not under our direct control. We support them, we work with them, the intelligence is being provided, but the truth of the matter is that our military and police are very few in number and they are overstretched.\u201d\n\nThe governor acknowledged that the security agencies were doing their best, but said their efforts were not enough.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, you have to understand the limitations that they face before you conclude that they are not doing enough. They are doing a lot. But is it enough? Certainly, not. Much more needs to be done.\n\n\u201cBut can they do more with the number of policemen they have and the number of soldiers? I don\u2019t know. We need to ramp up recruitment in the Nigeria Police; we need to ramp up recruitment in the Nigerian armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe have too few number and our armed forces are overstretched. They are operating in several states, about 33 states, the last time we checked, and how many are they? So, we must understand the constraint that they face and sympathise with them.\n\n\u201cBut with the acquisition of more advanced equipment from Jordan, China, Turkey and the United States, we expect that the kinetic capabilities of our armed forces will be greatly improved. So, we hope to see the end of this insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe governor, however, said despite the level of insecurity in Kaduna, the state had continued to attract investments even though it could have been better.\n\nHe stated, \u201cKaduna State is a huge state. We have 46,000 square kilometres. So, the fact that there is insecurity in one part does not mean there\u2019s insecurity everywhere. It\u2019s not Lagos; it\u2019s not a small place at all.\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve had investment summit and they have been very successful. In the last five years, we have attracted nearly $3billion in investments, in spite of all these stories about insecurity, because investors know that large parts of Kaduna State are quite safe; they are safe as anything.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the House of Representatives, the lawmakers urged the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, and as well the National Commission for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons to intervene by providing relief materials and support for the victims of insecurity in Kaduna State.\n\nThe resolutions were sequel to the adoption of a motion sponsored by Hon. Shehu Balarabe at the plenary yesterday. Moving the motion, Balarabe lamented that killing and kidnapping of innocent citizens in his constituency by armed bandits, saying it has reached an unbearable dimension.\n\nHe recalled that the persistent and increasing cases of armed bandits attacks, killings and kidnappings in Giwa and other local governments, which has continued, hds been made known to the House several times.\n\nHe recalled that the armed bandits had shot dead a member of Kaduna State House of Assembly, representing Giwa West constituency, Hon. Rilwanu Aminu Gadaga on December13.\n\nThe bandits, he further recalled, had recently massacred 40 people in villages within the Giwa constituency, burning several houses, destroying motorcycles and other properties.\n\nWhile acknowledging the efforts of the state government and various security agencies to counter the bandits and stop the killings, the lawmaker expressed concern that despite the current effort of government and security agencies, those bandits have continued to strike mercilessly and ruthlessly on innocent citizens.\n\nAdopting the motion, the House mandated its committee on disaster management to visit the local government, access the situation and report back within two weeks for further legislative action.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lead counsel to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has said that an undisclosed senior attorney will henceforth lead the defence team of the pro-Biafra separatist leader.\n\nEjiofor revealed that a visit to Kanu in the detention of the Department of State Services (DSS) on Monday was described as \u201ca surprise Christmas present\u201d with the inclusion of the lawyer he called a \u201clegal giant, a consummate member of the Inner Bar, a legal Iroko, who has distinguished himself in the practice of law.\u201d\n\nEjiofor decided not to reveal the identity of the new lawyer who would be in the frontline of Kanu\u2019s legal battle against the Nigerian government, noting that, \u201cWe have opted to desist from publicising to you our legal exploits for certain salutary reasons. It has also become necessary that we show such restraint because of the presence of moles who have infiltrated and literally taken over the social media space.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said these in an update on his visit to Kanu on Monday, which was made available to SaharaReporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWe paid our routine visit to our untiring, unwavering, unrelenting, rock-solid and noble client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yesterday, at the DSS detention facility at Abuja. The visit, this time, was spectacular and was greeted by an infectious air of camaraderie. Onyendu was particularly enthused by the visit and preferred to describe it as 'A SURPRISE CHRISTMAS PRESENT'.\n\n\u201cYou may not understand the peculiarity of this visit and how significant it is. But in due course, I am certain you will be in the best position to fully appreciate the wisdom that informed it. Suffice it to say that as the lead attorney of Onyendu, I took advantage of the visit to unveil a legal giant, a distinguished and an accomplished member of the Inner Bar, whom I have chosen to fortify our defence team.\n\n\u201cThe learned Senior counsel is an excellent and a consummate learned gentleman, distinguished in academics and in the practice of law in our law courts. The reason that informed this arrangement is my unflinching desire to throw in every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that Onyendu gets the BEST at all times.\n\n\u201cThis latest masterstroke, evident in the legal giant that has intervened, came to Onyendu as a big surprise. Although he was not oblivious of my arrangement to enlist the assistance and co-operation of a Senior attorney, he did not know that I could get a Senior attorney of the rarest breed. He was particularly delighted to welcome this legal giant, a consummate member of the Inner Bar, a legal Iroko, who has distinguished himself in the practice of law when we visited him yesterday.\n\n\u201cI must state here and now that the Senior attorney involved has been my mentor over the years. He has worked from the sidelines with our legal team since 2016. He is a man imbued with profound intellect, legal sophistry, an infectious sense of history, much like Onyendu, and of impeccable character. His brilliance radiates effortlessly. He is indeed an excellent advocate.\n\n\u201cThe stage which we have attained in the court gymnastics involving Onyendu signposts an auspicious time at which to introduce the leading and erudite member of the Inner Bar to our defence team.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, he will lead our defence team in proceedings in court.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting yesterday, we deliberated extensively on other issues. But such deliberations, for tactical reasons, are to remain private for now. I want to assure you, UMUCHINEKE, that our legal team, is, presently, more fortified than ever to do battle in court, and God being on our side, victory is assured,\u201d the statement said further.\n\n\u201cI must hasten to declare to you that we are not relenting in our firm resolve to secure the release of other members who have been unjustly and unlawfully incarcerated in the various detention facilities of Nigeria's security agencies all over the country.\n\n\u201cSome of those persons include Ada Nsukka, Idara, and others, who were recently abducted by lawless and overzealous agents of the state. I assure you that in due course we will effectively utilise the instrumentality of the law to set them at liberty.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that we do not publicise our legal interventions in the social media space does not mean that we are not taking concrete and effective steps to secure the release of all those unjustly detained. I assure you that we have been taking effective steps and implementing concrete measures geared towards that.\u201d",

The reason that informed this arrangement is my unflinching desire to throw in every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that Onyendu gets the BEST at all times.\n\n\u201cThis latest masterstroke, evident in the legal giant that has intervened, came to Onyendu as a big surprise. Although he was not oblivious of my arrangement to enlist the assistance and co-operation of a Senior attorney, he did not know that I could get a Senior attorney of the rarest breed. He was particularly delighted to welcome this legal giant, a consummate member of the Inner Bar, a legal Iroko, who has distinguished himself in the practice of law when we visited him yesterday.\n\n\u201cI must state here and now that the Senior attorney involved has been my mentor over the years. He has worked from the sidelines with our legal team since 2016. He is a man imbued with profound intellect, legal sophistry, an infectious sense of history, much like Onyendu, and of impeccable character. His brilliance radiates effortlessly. He is indeed an excellent advocate.\n\n\u201cThe stage which we have attained in the court gymnastics involving Onyendu signposts an auspicious time at which to introduce the leading and erudite member of the Inner Bar to our defence team.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, he will lead our defence team in proceedings in court.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting yesterday, we deliberated extensively on other issues. But such deliberations, for tactical reasons, are to remain private for now. I want to assure you, UMUCHINEKE, that our legal team, is, presently, more fortified than ever to do battle in court, and God being on our side, victory is assured,\u201d the statement said further.\n\n\u201cI must hasten to declare to you that we are not relenting in our firm resolve to secure the release of other members who have been unjustly and unlawfully incarcerated in the various detention facilities of Nigeria's security agencies all over the country.\n\n\u201cSome of those persons include Ada Nsukka, Idara, and others, who were recently abducted by lawless and overzealous agents of the state. I assure you that in due course we will effectively utilise the instrumentality of the law to set them at liberty.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that we do not publicise our legal interventions in the social media space does not mean that we are not taking concrete and effective steps to secure the release of all those unjustly detained. I assure you that we have been taking effective steps and implementing concrete measures geared towards that.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

But we realized that over the years, the LGAs are neglected whereas they are very critical to the development of a state. Let us not dwell on the challenges because challenges are always there. We should dwell more on the potential. I am quite happy about the three LGAs selected for this pilot survey because in each, there are tertiary institutions, which also brings huge opportunities.\n\n\u201cIn developing economies, it starts with research. So, the potentials in these tertiary institutions in the LGAs would be utilized optimally. We need to think about the kind of partnership with the tertiary institutions in terms of research and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Governor\u2019s 2022 budget proposal, you will see that capital infrastructure is very huge, which is because of the government\u2019s zeal to fix our state.

          "title": "Ned Nwoko Threatens Sahara Reporters with Lawsuit, Demands N10bn for Defamation",
          "text": "Sanya Obajemu\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives, Prince Ned Nwoko, has written to Sahara Reporters to retract its \u201cdefamatory statement\u201d against his person or face court action.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Sahara Reporters by Nwoko\u2019s solicitor, Rolls Law Firm, demanded for a retraction of the libelous publication in the online news platform and also asked Sahara Reporters to publish an apology in two national dailies backed with a payment of N10bn as damages for the publication of the said libel.\n\nThe letter dated 20th December, 2021 and signed by Mr. Onyeka Nwokolo (Esq.) reads, \u201cwe are solicitors to Hon. Prince (Dr.) Ned Munir Nwoko (herein referred to as \u201cOur Client\u201d) and on whose behalf and instruction we write you this letter, our client\u2019s attention has been drawn by several people including members of his family, friends, business associate and co-politicians amongst other well-meaning Nigerians to serials of your false publications in your news media where you maliciously with intent to bring our client to contempt and ridicule him in the eyes of the public published false, untrue and concocted stories about him.\n\n\u201cIn one of such publications dated 14th August, 2020 and captioned, \u201cHow Ned Nwoko Humiliated Monarch, Asked Police To Dig Up Palace\u201d, you maliciously and falsely stated that Ned Nwoko, a former federal lawmaker from Delta State, \u201cOrdered the arrest of Prince Chukwunonso Nwoko, monarch of the town, and subsequently asked the police to ransack his palace\u201d.\n\n\u201cYour falsely claimed in your publication that our client was induced to take the above stated action because, \u201cthe monarch and some residents of Idumuje-Ugboko had opposed Nwoko\u2019s attempt to forcefully acquire additional 90 hectares of land from an area earmarked for all indigenes of the community\u201d.\n\n\u201cYour references to our client as an unconscionable land grabber who has intimidated and cowed an entire community in order to takeover people\u2019s lands gravely profiles him as a bully, marauder, buccaneer, pirate, Viking, and a bandit. The implication and innuendos from the false allegations are that our client abuses the privileges of God\u2019s favours and endowment on him to oppress and extort others not equally endowed.\n\n\u201cIt casts him as devious, manipulative, dishonest and fraudulent person of questionable character in the eyes of respectable people in the society.\n\n\u201cThis is in stark contrast to the reality and reputation of our client as a former lawmaker, a philanthropist, accessible, easy-going and stickler for rule of law. Our client was, hitherto, widely renowned in Delta State, Nigeria and worldwide for ventilating his convictions both in politics and business by due process of the law through established conflict resolution framework and judicial process.\n\n\u201cOur client deliberately ignored the unprovoked slur and distraction your false publications sought to inflict on his reputation and focus on the more serious projects he has at hand. It is ironical that our client\u2019s pacifist, disposition would appear to have reinforced your recklessness in directing more attacks against his person, business, reputation and integrity.\n\n\u201d Few days ago, our client\u2019s attention was to drawn to yet another false, wicked, malicious and defamatory publication dated 15th December, 2021 by you and published in several News and Social media captioned, \u201cEX-HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MEMBER, NED NWOKO ACCUSED OF SCAMMING AFRICAN LEADERS WITH \u2018WHITE ELEPHANT PROJECTS\u2019\u201d, wherein you published to the world and repeated the above cited falsehood about our client intimidating an entire community and grabbing their lands by coercion.\n\n\u201d You went further to add new and false claims about the Paris Club Refunds and the Malaria Eradication Project being undertaken by the Ned Nwoko Foundation. Our clients\u2019 involvement with the Paris Club Refund in Nigeria has been an open subject and public knowledge. It has been subjected to judicial scrutiny, private company review and audit by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and forensic investigation three (3) times by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In 2016, at a time no money had been paid to our client the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami in response to a claim by a whistleblower NGO, that our client has been paid about $6bUSD with the respect to the Paris Club Refund issued a stern instruction to the EFCC to conduct detailed investigation against our client. He was invited and volumes of documents and files taken away. The EFCC Investigation Report affirmed our clients\u2019 role in the Paris Club Refunds. Two successive review investigations were further carried out by the EFCC with the same outcome. Our client was subsequently paid part of his entitlements.\n\n\u201d Our client unequivocally denies all the allegations you made against him in the said publications, and other publications by you on same subject which the constraint of space cannot be contained herein, all of which were intended to drag his integrity to the mud.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary:\n\nThe said Prince Chukwunonso Nwoko was fingered in the investigation and prosecution of a case of violence and destruction of properties in Idumuje-Ugboko sometime in May 2017. A prosecution witness identified him and some others as working in concert and masterminded the mindless terror and destruction visited on Idumuje-Ugboko in 2017. A cursory investigation or verification would have revealed this fact to you;\n\nb. with respect to acquisition of land, our client followed laid down processes in the acquisition of lands in Idumuje-Ugboko and anywhere else in Nigeria. Again, this fact could easily have been established had you spared any consideration to tell a balance story.\n\n\u201cYour malicious publication were deliberately orchestrated to inflict indelible scares on the reputation of our client as easily verifiable facts were advertently ignored by you to foster your quest to destroy as illustrated hereof.\n\n\u201cBy available records, the claim that the late king\u2019s signature on the letter approving the allocation of the land was forged has been investigated and authenticated by experts. Those who peddled the false allegation were charged for false information.\n\n\u201cThe LGA Chairman affirmed that he conferred with the late king and confirmed that he signed the letter before they proceeded with formalizing the allocation.\n\n\u201cThe Adviser to the Delta State Governor on Peace and Reconciliation, one Chief Uzor confirmed the late king\u2019s signature.\n\nA cursory investigation by you would also have revealed to you as follows:\n\nThat Prince Chukwunonso Nwoko has never been proclaimed the king of Idumuje-Ugboko by the elder (senior) members of the Nwoko Royal Family.\n\nThat Prince Chukwunonso Nwoko was not recommended to the Anioma North Traditional Rulers Committee.\n\nThat the Anioma North Traditional Rulers\u2019 Committee recommended Crown Prince Solomon Eziokwubundu Nwoko as the Obi(king) Idumuje-Ugboko\n\nThat the Chairman Anioma Traditional Rulers\u2019 Forum HRM Asagba (Prof.) Chike Edozien recommended Crown Prince Solomon Eziokwubundu Nwoko to the Delta State Government for presentation of Staff of Office as the Obi (king) of Idumuje-Ugboko by the Governor.\n\n\u201cCourt judgments are public documents which are readily available at registry of every court in Nigeria. There is also the Freedom of Information Act which empowers sincere media organization seeking to publish truth to secure any public information they require. There have been several court judgements arising from the Paris Club Refunds involving our client. If you had sought information, we would have gladly supplied you the details to enable you issue an objective publication.\n\n\u201cHad you taken the steps in paragraph (e) above, you would have found out that the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) entered into a Terms of Settlement signed by their Chairman and the Director General, Asishana B. Okauru, with Ned Nwolo acknowledging;\n\n\u201cThat Ned Nwolo worked for them and is entitled to be paid.\n\nThat they (NGF) shall issue a Letter of No Objection to payment to Ned Nwoko and the associated company Linas International Limited.\n\nThat in furtherance of the court Judgment, the NGF issued the Letter of No Objection to as stated above to the Federal Ministry Of Finance.\n\nThat from the records that there is no clam of $418mUSD by the NGF against Ned Nwolo or any of his associated companies\n\nThat there are several court orders In favor of Ned Nwoko with respect to the subject matter.\n\nThat the University project is gradually evolving as conceived.\n\nYou would have discovered a treasure trove of factual information contrary to the malicious and deliberate falsehood you have been publishing.\n\nBased on the foregoing it is obvious that you deliberately and recklessly misrepresented the status of Prince Chukwunonso Nwoko to add vitriol and sensationalize your false publication to gain prominent and wide readership in order to sully our clients reputation and standing in the society.\n\n\u201cOur client is well-respected person in Idumuje-Ugboko, Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State and everywhere both within and outside the shores of this country. He was a member of the Federal House of Representatives, a senatorial aspirant, a multiple Honorary doctorate awardee, an astute politician, an international lawyer, a business mogul and a Philanthropist. He is a social crusader who has the interest of his people at heart and always attract developmental project to his people. Our client is renown world-wide for leading the crusade and fight to eradicate malaria. And as such he has a substantial social-media presence and following.\n\n\u201cThe publications you made were read by the public within and outside Nigeria and it has cost our client his reputation as well- meaning Nigerians are beginning to look at our client with contempt and disdain and he is being ridiculed and openly embarrassed as a land grabber and extortionist. His involvement in proposed businesses and several other activities are met with sudden cold shoulder and silent rebuff since after your false and malicious publication. They believed your false story and think our client is a dishonest person.\n\n\u201cYour repetition of these falsehoods and garnishing same with new additions on each occasion betrays a deliberate baiting of our client to a reaction and response.\n\n\u201cWe therefore formally make the following demands fro you;\n\na, That you publish in two national newspapers as well as in your online News Media statement retracting the Libelous Publications of 14th August 2020 and 15th December 2021 respectively with an unreserved apology.\n\nb, That the sum of #10,000,000,000 (Ten Billion Naira) only be paid to our clients\u2019 compensation for the malicious, false and disparaging publications.\n\nThis letter should also be taken as a pre-action notice to you peradventure you choose not heed to our Client\u2019s demands.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi Osogbo\n\nThree prominent leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, today expressed their readiness to work together to rescue the party from what they described as imminent collapse and electoral loss.\n\nAmong them are the immediate past deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yussuff; former Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Hon Najeem Salam and former Secretary to Osun State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti.\n\nThe trio jointly declared that APC cannot win the 2022 governorship election if it fields the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, as candidate.\n\nThe trio who also contested the ticket of the party with Oyetola in 2018 lamented that the governor has been playing politics of exclusiveness and disunity since he took over.\n\nSpeaking at a special meeting of The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of the party in the state, Salam said it was disheartening that genuine APC members who worked for the emergence of Oyetola, were being treated as outcast and nonentities by the governor and his people.\n\nAccording to him, Oyetola was mismanaging the party because he is an opportunist, who got the party\u2019s ticket on a platter of gold.\n\nHe said Yussuff, Adeoti and himself have resolved to downplay individual political interest, accept and work with whoever emerges among them as the candidate of the party in 2022.\n\nThe former Speaker urged party members to work in unison to realise the dreams of the majority in a bid to salvage the party and the state.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Yussuff, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, said it was painful that the APC in the state is in the hands of an impostor, stating that the party is in disarray and needed to be restructured.\n\nYussuff said he decided to join hands with other leaders of the party in The Osun Progressives because of his love for progressives, his relationship with the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aragbesola and the need to take the party back to the genuine progressives in the state.\n\nAccording to him, APC ran into problem in 2018 because its leaders refused to allow collective leadership to play out, accusing them of imposing Oyetola on the APC members.\n\nHe submitted that this time around, the leaders of the party are ready to embrace collective leadership which will start from presenting a candidate from their camp against Oyetola during the primaries of the party.\n\nIn his address, Adeoti, the governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in 2018, said it was surprising that a governor that won with just 482 votes would be chasing away quality APC members and leaders.\n\nAdeoti said it was hypocritical and unfair for Oyetola to be dissociating himself from policies, programmes and projects of Aregbesola\u2019s administration, disclosing that he was actively involved in every decision of the government as Chief of Staff to the governor.\n\nThe former SSG accused elders of the APC of nonchalant attitude to settlement of misunderstanding in the party before it snowballed into full crisis.\n\nHe specifically accused the former Chairman of the party, Prince Gboyega Famodun of being a party to the crisis, saying that the he was also not willing to relate with anybody that has relationship with Aregbesola.\n\nAdeoti concluded that the window of reconciliation has been closed, stating that what is needed was to be united to rescue the party from sinking.\n\nAll the three governorship aspirants jointly promised to work together, restructure the party and position it for victory in 2022.\n\nOsun \u2018APC Chairman,\u2019 Hon. Rasaq Salinsile, said it was unfortunate that the party found itself in the current mess, saying that the crisis would have been settled had Oyetola been a genuine progressive and a fair human being.\n\nSalinsile said the party has decided to choose candidate from Osun West Senatorial District in the 2022 governorship election.\n\nThe Oranmiyan House on Gbongan/Ibadan road was filled to the brim as members of the APC trooped out to welcome the three politicians.",

          "text": "Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has announced a cabinet reconstitution highlighted by the creation of a new ministry of Homeland Security and Vigilante Affairs to be headed by Dr Ugorji Ugorji.\n\nThe 18 new commissioners sworn in by the governor are mainly technocrats drawn from various professional backgrounds, to reconstitute a cabinet the governor had whittled down some months ago.\n\nThe creation of the Ministry of Homeland Security and Vigilante Affairs is mainly significant, as it demonstrates the administration\u2019s readiness to tackle the spate of rising insecurity in the state proactively and innovatively.\n\nThe man at the helms of affairs of the ministry, Dr Ugorji \u2013 is a Security Analyst and Global Affairs scholar, with expertise in human capital development, and homeland security. By the age of 29 he had earned four university degrees \u2013 two bachelor\u2019s degrees, one master\u2019s degree, and a doctorate degree. His doctorate is in Educational Leadership and Administration from Rutgers University, New Jersey.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also bagged a second Master\u2019s degree in Homeland Security from George Washington University, Washington, DC. He has over 35 years of experience in public administration at local, state, national and international levels.\n\nIn January 2021 Dr. Ugorji was appointed by Governor Uzodimma as the first ever Special Adviser on Homeland Security and Intelligence for the state.\n\nSpeaking on his elevation and appointment as the pioneer commissioner of the ministry of Homeland Security and Vigilante Affairs, Dr Ugorji said: \u201cFirst, I have no words that are adequate to express my gratitude to Governor Uzodimma. No matter how skilled or talented one is, it would amount to very little if one does not get opportunities to use or demonstrate them. The governor has given me a chance not just to serve in his Shared Prosperity Government, but also to make a difference in the lives of the citizenry of Imo State. I shall not fail him or my beloved people of Imo State.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Governor Uzodimma\u2019s resolve to pursue the recovery of the taken properties of Imo State as part of his 3R agenda marks him out as a man of integrity; adding that His accomplishments in this direction will establish a refreshing, reassuring landscape of patriotic conduct for all government officials moving forward.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGovernor Hope Uzodimma\u2019s choice to stand with our people in facing down the sponsored and orchestrated challenges of insecurity in the state and his great strides in that arena speak loudly for his character,\u201d the commissioner said.\n\nUgorji further noted that Gov Uzodimma has demonstrated his foresight in, and comfort with new methodologies and a holistic, whole-of-government approach to security and safety by elevating his current portfolio of SA on Homeland Security and Intelligence, to a full-fledged Ministry of Homeland Security and Vigilante Affairs.\n\n\u201cFurther, there can be no greater appraisal of my team\u2019s performance in the last 12 months than the creation of the ministry. We now have the historic and exciting task of building a new ministry at the directions of Governor Uzodimma. A ministry we hope will streamline security efforts in the state and become a model for the rest of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe newly sworn-in commissioner appreciated his family, friends, supporters and many who offered prayers for him in various places of worship; as well as congratulations in various languages.\n\n\u201cI say thank you, I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me. My commitment is to help many others stand as well,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Strong indication emerged Tuesday that the Senate may override President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal of assent to the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 at plenary Wednesday.\n\nAt the expiration of the time frame for him to append his signature to the Bill, Buhari wrote the National Assembly of his decision not to sign the document into law, citing a number of reasons.\n\nIn a letter forwarded to the Senate and read during plenary, the president cited series of reasons bordering on security, economy, finance and existing constitutional provisions of political parties for refusing assent to the bill.\n\nThe reasons were advanced in respect of the contentious area in the Bill-the recommended mandatory direct primary for all political parties in picking their candidates for general elections.\n\nLeading the move, Senator George Sekibo (PDP Rivers East), called for a closed door session in the mid of the plenary which lasted 40 minutes.\n\nBut no categorical decision was taken thereafter by the Senate which hurriedly adjourned to Wednesday.\n\nExpressing his anger to journalists after the plenary, Sekibo said, about 73 signatures of aggrieved senators had been collected and that there was no going back on the decision to override Buhari\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cBy law, we have the power to override him. That\u2019s what section 58 (4 & 5) said. We will use our powers to do it. And they are saying that people must be present at voting.\n\n\u201cOur rule gives us three methods of voting- voice vote, by signing the document (signature) and electronic voting. So we can use anyone.\n\n\u201cWe have already collected signatures totalling about 73 now in and outside the chamber and it cuts across party lines,\u201d he said.\n\nConfirming the move in a separate interview, Senator Matthew Urhoghide (PDP Edo South) said the Senate, and by extension the National Assembly, must extricate itself from public odium slammed on it as rubber stamp by overriding the veto .\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must be reminded that members of the National Assembly are truly the representatives of the people because every Federal Constituency and Senatorial District seat is allocated to a segment of the Nigerian people who are their constituents.\n\n\u201cThe members of the National Assembly consulted with a cross section of their constituents to reach an informed position on any matter of national interest and development.\n\n\u201cThe issue of direct primaries in our electoral process has been well canvassed, elucidated, and argued by both chambers of the NASS, and inputs were taken at public hearing from across the spectrum of all critical stakeholders.\n\n\u201cBoth chambers passed the bill with some little variations in some sections which consequently necessitated the setting up of a conference committee of five members each from both chambers. At the end of all the deliberations, direct primary was agreed upon.\n\n\u201cThe time has come when only popular candidates within the party should be thrown up for general elections. General elections in this way will become easier and less cumbersome for parties to win since they have truly popular candidates.\n\n\u201cAs we speak today, the whole world has become a global village. Nigeria should endeavour to revolutionise its electoral system to avert bickering and unnecessary disputation that come with nominations or party primaries.\n\n\u201cIn Chile, Gabriel Boric, a thirty five-year old former student activist has won the run off in the presidential election because he was truly popular and supported by the people.\n\n\u201cLess than two hours into counting of the ballots, his much older opponent congratulated him and urged all his compatriots to support his incoming government.\n\n\u201cNigeria must take a queue by allowing genuine inclusiveness, particularly our young people who are in excess of sixty percent of our population. All the devious designs to exclude them will not help us.\n\n\u201cI urge my colleagues in the National Assembly to do the needful by overriding the veto and make the bill law. This is not the first time it is happening in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRecalling a similar scenario, the lawmaker said: \u201cThe NDDC Bill of 2001 was vetoed by NASS under Obasanjo, who was a PDP president. The NASS should extricate itself from public odium and disrespect by going ahead to override President Buhari who is APC. History stares NASS in the face if indeed it is not a rubber stamp.\u201d\n\nMany other Senators who pleaded anonymity strongly expressed their readiness to override President Buhari on the rejected bill.\n\nFayemi excited\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti state Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has expressed support for the president\u2019s decision.\n\nFayemi spoke Tuesday while addressing journalists after his visit to the president at the State House, Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMr. President has not objected to direct primaries, neither has he endorsed indirect primaries, he has only said, be fair to all, let all options apply and what you decide should be determined by your own local and peculiar circumstances; being mindful of questions of security, finances, and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we all should commend the courage of Mr. President to stand with the people.\u201d\n\nAdegboruwa faults Buhari\n\nBut in another reaction, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has accused President Buhari of sabotaging efforts to ensure electoral reforms for the benefit of the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nAdegboruwa said this in a statement issued Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by Blueprint.\n\nThe SAN asked the National Assembly to invoke the provisions of section 58(5) of the Constitution to pass the Bill into law, through the two-thirds majority of both chambers.\n\nThe silk said by declining assent to the bill, the president did not properly exercise his discretion in the national interest.\n\nAdegboruwa said: \u201cWhat this means is that the president prefers to retain all the manifest flaws bedeviling our electoral system from which himself and his ruling party are benefiting to the detriment of our democratic advancement.\n\n\u201cAlthough the President is entitled to the discretion of his assent to any bill presented to him, however, the reason adduced for the exercise of such presidential discretion must be legal and valid.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the discretion has not been properly exercised in the national interest, in this particular case.\u201d\n\nCSOs\n\nAlso, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have expressed concern over the non-assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by the president.\n\nThey said the decision would have serious implication on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the body prepares for the FCT Area Council election, the Ekiti/Osun governorship elections, and ultimately the 2023 General Elections.\n\nThe CSOs stated this Tuesday in a joint statement by Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD),The Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS),Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF) and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nWithholding of assent by the president to a bill relevant electoral stakeholders spent quality time putting together, they said, undermines public confidence and trust in the electoral system.\n\nThe bodies also said it was even more disappointing that Buhari \u201cdelayed his response until the efflux ion of time required for assenting to legislation until the date that the National Assembly is proceeding for the Christmas and New Year holiday.\u201d\n\nThey further said \u201cthe non-conclusion of the electoral amendment process will mean that these elections will be conducted using the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) denying INEC the opportunity to test the efficacy of some of the new innovations introduced in the proposed Electoral Bill 2021.\u201d\n\nThe bodies also noted that \u201cthis is apart from the delay the commission will have to contend with in the required effort to review its guidelines, regulations and manuals in accordance with certain provisions of the Bill.\u201d\n\nThe statement said: \u201cFurthermore, based on the revised timelines for specific electoral activities in the Bill, INEC and other stakeholders will have to grapple with logistical, financial, and programmatic difficulties in the run-up to the 2023 General Election. We reckon that this may not bode well for Nigeria\u2019s electoral democracy, hence the clamor for the speedy conclusion of the electoral reform process.\n\n\u201cTo avert further complications and logjam in the efforts to strengthen the electoral process, we strongly recommend as follows:The National Assembly as a matter of national emergency should either override the President\u2019s decision or remove the contentious clause (s) from the Bill and transmit the Bill back to the President for assent within the next 30 days.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should ensure that all clerical, editorial, and cross-referencing gaps in the current Bill are resolved before transference back to the President.\n\n\u201cThe president should expeditiously assent to the revised Bill upon receipt from the National Assembly and the Civil society groups, media, and development partners must sustain the effort to protect the will of the people and safeguard the electoral reform process from policy capture and manipulation.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to assent to the electoral act amendment bill drew reactions from several quarters on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Governors such as Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti and Samuel Ortom of Benue State lauded the President\u2019s decision, civil society organisations (CSOs) and some federal lawmakers were clearly disappointed.\n\nThe National Assembly had transmitted the bill to the President in November but in a letter dated December 13 and forwarded to the National Assembly, he informed them of his decision to withhold his signature.\n\nIn his letter, President Buhari cited several issues with the bill\u2019s clause on direct primaries.\n\nThe President, according to the letter, explained that direct primaries are expensive. This, he said, will put a financial burden on the country\u2019s resources.\n\nHe further noted that conducting direct primary elections will be tasking, explaining that since such mode of election means a large turnout of voters, the move would stretch the security agencies.\n\nThe Nigerian leader equally fears that with direct primaries, citizens\u2019 rights will be violated while smaller political parties may face marginalisation.\n\nAccording to him, the move will also lead to more litigations by party members.\n\nSenators deliberate next move\n\nSenators on Tuesday held closed-door sessions to discuss the next steps over the bill.\n\nA Senator of the Peoples Democratic Party, George Sekibo, in an interview with Channels Television said some Senators were considering a veto of the bill.\n\nBy law, the National Assembly can bypass presidential assent of a bill into law through a two-third majority vote.\n\nAccording to Sekibo, a total of 73 signatures have been compiled for the veto.\n\nHowever, Senate President Lawan adjourned Tuesday\u2019s session till Wednesday where a decision over the matter is expected to be made.\n\nReps eye 2022\n\nAt the House of Representatives, deliberations over the bill\u2019s setback were shifted to 2022.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbjabiamila revealed this on Tuesday as the lawmakers went on recess for the Christmas and New Year break.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, that bill has not received presidential assent, and it falls to parliament to decide the best way forward,\u201d Gbjabiamila told his colleagues. \u201cWhen we return in the new year, we will resume our efforts to reform the electoral system in our country; and we will do it together.\n\n\u201cThat is what the Nigerian people expect of us, and we will do our duty for God and country. As long as this one breathes, it will survive. When we return, we will address it.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nGbajabiamila explained that the time was short to address the sensitive issue at hand because members were set to proceed on break and they must pass other important bills such as the 2022 Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill before doing so.\n\nHe stated that the new bill introduced several innovations, besides direct primaries, to help advance the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe speaker, who commended the lawmakers for the efforts they made to ensure the passage of the bill, reminded them of the Legislative Agenda of the 9th House, which he said must be followed through to its conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn the past, election years have witnessed a decline in governance activities as political pursuits cloud the calendar. That will not be the case this time around. As you are aware, we have a legislative agenda in this 9th House of Representatives, which we tagged \u2018Our Contract with Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI expect that we will do everything within our power to keep the commitments we made in that document so that when we appear before our various constituencies, we can stand tall in the knowledge that despite challenges and difficulties, we did what we promised to do and given a chance again, will do even more.\u201d\n\nCivil societies kick\n\nMeanwhile, civil society organisations expressed displeasure at the president\u2019s decision not to assent to the bill.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Executive Director, Clement Nwankwo, the Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC) said the situation was \u201cworrying\u201d and \u201cposes a serious threat to the conduct of the forthcoming 2023 Nigerian General Elections.\u201d\n\nHowever, PLAC urged the National Assembly to review the president\u2019s demands on party primaries \u201cin order to save the other landmark reforms contained in the Electoral Bill 2021, over which the President has expressed no worries\u201d.\n\n\u201cPLAC is also calling on the National Assembly to treat the issue of passing the new Electoral Bill as a matter of national emergency and convene a special session in the shortest possible time and irrespective of their end of year break, to consider a vote for the passage of the Electoral Bill 2021,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\ufeff\n\nHuman rights lawyer and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, described President\u2019s Buhari decision as akin to throwing out the baby and the bathwater.\n\n\u201cThe reason adduced for the rejection of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is grossly misleading,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cSection 87 of the current Electoral Act provides for either direct or indirect primaries. In fact, the APC used direct primary for the emergence of its presidential candidate in 2019. In other words, President Buhari is a beneficiary of direct primary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBy rejecting the Bill on the ground that it provided for direct primary the President decided to throw away the baby and the bathwater. Thus, the President rejected electronic voting which he had endorsed when he admitted that he is a beneficiary of electronic accreditation of voters by the use of card readers.\n\n\u201cWith respect, direct primary is in consonance with section 223 of the Constitution which has imposed a duty on political parties to elect their officers through democratic elections. There is no provision in the Constitution for the imposition of candidates by money bags through indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cThe INEC has submitted a bill of N305 billion for the entire 2023 general elections. So who conjured the figure of N500 billion for the primaries to give the impression that it is an expensive venture? In any case, since electronic voting had been adopted by the National Assembly it was going to be used for both primary and general elections. So the cost would have been significantly reduced. The fear of insecurity is a red herring in that political parties have continued to hold huge rallies even in defiance of Covid 19 restrictions imposed by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cHaving rejected to assent to the Electoral Amendment Bill in 2018 and 2021, President Buhari has confirmed beyond any shadow of a doubt that his administration will not allow the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct credible elections in 2023 and thereafter. That is going to be the tragic legacy of the President and the ruling party that were campaigning for electoral reforms before the 2015 general elections.\n\n\u201cThe challenge before the National Assembly is to invoke the provision of section 58 (5) of the Constitution to pass the Bill into law by the resolution of two-thirds majority of the members. However, if the national assembly cannot muster the required two-thirds majority, section 87 of the Act which allows direct or indirect primaries should be left intact so that the other provisions of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021 can be passed again by the legislators and assented to by the President.\u201d\n\nPraise for Buhari\n\nAfter meeting with the President on Tuesday, Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, praised the decision to withhold assent on the electoral bill.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents after meeting with the president in his office, Fayemi said it does not matter to the governors which mode is adopted for the conduct of primaries.\n\nThe governor, who is also the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, dismissed talks that the president was simply conceding to the wishes of the governors.\n\nWhile noting that Buhari\u2019s desire is to see that all options are provided for, he said there is an exaggerated expectation that direct primaries will resolve electoral challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cI think all of us should be happy with that we shouldn\u2019t really dwell too much on there\u2019s been this exaggerated expectation that direct primaries are going to provide all answers to whatever electoral challenges that we have faced,\u201d he said.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe governor noted that both direct and indirect primaries have unique challenges and called for options to be provided.\n\nBenue State Governor Ortom also commended President Buhari\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity again on behalf of people that are represented here in Benue State to commend Mr. President for withholding assent on the process of primaries of various political parties,\u201d he said at a briefing at the end of the meeting of the State Executive Council on Tuesday in Makurdi.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the National Assembly to reconsider the clause that allows for only direct primaries, and all the reasons that Mr. President advanced concerning the support for him withholding his assent are deeply appreciated.\n\n\u201cI assure you that as a veteran politician who had the privilege to witness direct primaries, witness indirect primaries, and witness consensus primaries, and someone who has the privilege to be a member of various political parties, it was almost unanimous that the issue of primaries should be the responsibility of various political parties.\u201d",

          "title": "FULL TEXT: President Buhari\u2019s letter on withholding assent to electoral bill -",
          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "Israel is to offer second COVID-19 booster shots as fast-spreading Omicron forces countries across the world to impose new curbs days before Christmas, but a South African study offered a glimmer of hope about the new variant\u2019s firepower.\n\nGovernments made urgent pleas for citizens to vaccinate as Omicron emerges as the dominant variant, upending reopening plans that many had hoped would herald the start of a post-pandemic era and unnerving financial markets.\n\nGermany, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea have reimposed partial or full lockdowns or other social distancing measures in recent days.\n\nAustria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Spain were among European countries due to consider new curbs on Wednesday.\n\nOmicron was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong. Studies indicate the variant is more resistant to vaccines developed before it emerged.\n\nHowever, the new South African study suggested reduced risk of hospitalisation in people infected with Omicron compared with Delta, although the authors said some of the reduction was likely due to high population immunity.\n\nThe study by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and major universities, which has not been peer-reviewed, compared data about Omicron in October and November with data about Delta between April and November, all in South Africa.\n\nThe authors found that the risk of hospital admission was roughly 80% lower for those infected with Omicron compared with Delta, and that for those in hospital the risk of severe disease was roughly 30% lower.\n\nThey also included several caveats and cautioned against jumping to conclusions. Results of a study by Imperial College London released last week showed there was no sign that Omicron was milder than Delta.\n\nMany scientists around the world believe that booster shots are key to limiting the severity of infection.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a waning of protection against Omicron infection. This wave is growing in surprisingly high numbers\u2026 More than 80% of the panel supported this measure,\u201d Arnon Shahar, a doctor on an Israeli Health Ministry expert panel, told Israel\u2019s Army Radio of the second booster shot campaign.\n\nTo go into effect, the recommendations must be approved by the ministry\u2019s director-general, Nachman Ash. The ministry did not say when that might happen.\n\nFrance said it could soon have around 100,000 new COVID-19 cases a day, up from around 70,000 currently as the country battles a fifth wave of the epidemic.\n\nMore than 275.18 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and nearly 5.7 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.\n\n\u2018LIFE AND DEATH\u2019\n\nInfections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in central China in December 2019.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday promised half a billion free rapid COVID-19 tests and warned the quarter of American adults who are unvaccinated that their choices could spell the \u201cdifference between life and death\u201d.\n\nSingapore will freeze all new ticket sales for flights and buses under its programme for quarantine-free travel into the city-state from Thursday to Jan. 20.\n\nJapan reported its first suspected case of community transmission of Omicron on Wednesday while India has urged its states to prepare for surges and allowed them to impose restrictions on crowds and gatherings.\n\nCountries are also looking to shorten the time between second vaccination shots and boosters. However, wary of public lockdown fatigue, there is reluctance to return to last year\u2019s strict curbs.\n\nAustralia on Wednesday reported more than 5,000 daily infections for the first time during the pandemic. Despite the surge, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday repeated strict lockdowns would not be brought back.\n\nThere was also resistance to new lockdowns in South Korea, where authorities announced restrictions on gatherings and operating times for restaurants, cafes and bars.\n\nSmall business and restaurant associations issued statements protesting the decision and calling for compensation, with one of the groups vowing to stage a demonstration on Wednesday.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not introduce new COVID-19 curbs in England before Christmas, but warned the government might need to act afterwards.\n\nGovernments have stepped up vaccination and treatment efforts with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set to authorise COVID-19 treatment pills from Pfizer Inc and Merck, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nPolicymakers are scrambling to address the economic hit that might come from new outbreaks with Britain announcing 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) of support for businesses hit hardest. read more\n\nEuropean stock indexes edged slightly higher on Wednesday, on track for a second day of gains even as Omicron infections surged.",

          "text": "Australian Open chief Craig Tiley is confident Rafa Nadal will be at Melbourne Park for next month\u2019s Grand Slam despite testing positive for COVID-19, but he is still uncertain whether Novak Djokovic will be playing.\n\nNadal caught the novel coronavirus while playing in an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi last week and said he would make a decision on his future tournaments depending on his \u201cevolution\u201d over the weeks ahead.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident Rafa will be here,\u201d tournament organiser Tiley said of the 20-times Grand Slam champion at Melbourne Park on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cPlayers that are testing positive now will complete a period of time until they are no longer infectious and they will be fine. If you are going to test positive and you want to play the Australian Open, your timing would be now.\u201d\n\nTiley reiterated that all players and staff at the Australian Open would be vaccinated or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts.\n\nThose requirements have prevented Djokovic, who has declined to disclose whether he is vaccinated, citing privacy, from confirming whether he will bid for a 21st Grand Slam title and a 10th Australian Open crown next month.\n\nTiley said that as far as he was aware, no players had yet been granted medical exemptions and that it would be up to Djokovic to disclose the grounds on which he gained entry to Australia.\n\n\u201cIf Novak shows up at the Australian Open, he\u2019ll either be vaccinated or he\u2019ll have a medical exemption,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMedically, he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone about it. I\u2019m not going to ask Novak that, it\u2019s none of my business.\n\n\u201cI will know that (he fulfils) one of those conditions.\u201d\n\nTiley said that if the world number one was going to play for Serbia in the ATP Cup in Sydney in the first week of January then he would be arriving with the first tranche of players next week.\n\n\u201cWe want to have the best players here, I\u2019d love to have Novak here,\u201d he added. \u201cIf he meets those conditions then great, if not, it\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nRoger Federer, the other men\u2019s player with 20 Grand Slam titles, and Serena Williams, who has won 23 Grand Slam titles, have already ruled themselves out of the tournament as they continue their recoveries from injury.\n\nTiley also announced that former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur and her fellow Australians Daria Saville and Maddy Inglis had been granted wildcards for the women\u2019s singles draw at the Jan. 17-30 tournament.",
