          "text": "\u2026tweeps call for his suspension\n\nLeke Adeboye, the son of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, slammed erring pastors of the church, calling them \u2018goats\u2019 for preaching their sermons after the G.O. had finished speaking and preaching.\n\nThis generated outrage on social media as many condemned the statement while some others called for his suspension.\n\nUsually, first Sunday of every month, parishes of the RCCG were linked up with the Nationwide Headquarters of the church, where the G.O. would deliver a sermon, expected to be the only sermon of the day. Meanwhile, some parish pastors did a follow-up preaching after the G.O\u2019s.\n\nReacting to such move, Pastor Leke took to his Instagram account and referred to the RCCG pastors who preached their messages after the G.O. had preached his sermon as \u2018goats.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhy would you go and preach another sermon after Daddy G.O. had just finished speaking and preaching.\n\n\u201cYou are not a son, you are a goat sir. Next Thanksgiving service, just do an altar call, then Thanksgiving,\u201d Leke posted.\n\nTweeps bemoaned this statement, called it rude and others demanded his suspension by the RCCG.\n\n\u201c#rccg should suspend Leke Adeboye for calling ordained pastors #GOAT. What a gut,\u201d @ollynetworker said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very rude of you, Leke Adeboye! You are the goat here,\u201d @Joanna8214 tweeted.\n\n@TomisinAmokeoja said, \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right, Leke Adeboye calling pastors goat was way overboard. Really leaves much to be desired. Always been controversial though. I wonder how he would have reacted if he was the G.O.\u201d\n\nA tweep, @CeciliaOkoroma, said that such a statement was not nice and unexpected from a man of God.\n\n\u201cThis is simply not too nice a statement from \u2018man of God\u2019 and in particular, son of G.O RCCG,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By David Royal\n\nNigerians have condemned comments made by Leke Adeboye, the last son and Senior Personal Assistant of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, who on Sunday slammed some RCCG pastors for preaching after his father had given the sermon of the day.\n\nIn some branches of RCCG all over Nigeria, after the Thanksgiving service, Parish pastors sometimes share their own messages after the Daddy G.O has delivered his sermon which is normally live-streamed across the branches all over the world.\n\n\n\nAs it is a norm in RCCG, Daddy G.O\u2019s sermon is expected to be the only sermon for that Sunday as all pastors were expected to connect to the National Headquarters where the General Overseer would deliver his.\n\nLeke who was not pleased to hear that some pastors went ahead to preach to their congregations after his father\u2019s sermon frowned at such pastors, describing them as goats.\n\n\n\nHe said \u201cWhy would you go and preach another sermon after Daddy GO had just finished speaking and preaching? You are not a son, you are a goat sir. Next Thanksgiving service, just do altar call, then Thanksgiving,\u201d he wrote.\n\nReacting to Leke\u2019s post, a follower on Instagram and member of RCCG @rosedek2021 commented \u201cMaybe you will push RCCG members to do the unthinkable, strike. Your name-calling of pastors and other antecedents show that you are naturally arrogant, since your father isn\u2019t you are the goat. You do not deserve the office you hold. I\u2019m looking forward to your resignation. You continue to embarrass your parents and RCCG, for how long will people do damage control on your behalf. I\u2019m a member of RCCG and if others wouldn\u2019t tell you some of us would, we\u2019re fed up of you.\u201d\n\n@joyfulpeak \u201cAs a member of RCCG, I have to say you keep embarrassing the church. My older brother that attends another ministry was the person that drew my attention to your ill advised social media clout chasing.\u201d\n\n@sad2unez \u201cThis is What happens when the Son of the Anointed thinks he too is Anointed and can make utterances. I expected you to step down, make a visual apology to the pastors you just labeled goats. But no you think because you are the Son of one of the greatest pastors in the world you can talk anyhow (Remember the Sons of Eli.) You should go and learn from Oyedepo\u2019s Children\u201d\n\n@Chukwueloka_EE, \u201cThe question is whether the sermon they preached is good or bad, as your Daddy doesn\u2019t own any sermon. Every good preaching is God\u2019s. Meanwhile, calling them goats is not right. This is how some founders will die: boom power tussle, property dragging etc will ensue.\u201d\n\n@CODE_61329, \u201cThis is quite disgusting of him to bring the internal ramblings/politics to the media! He should be ready for the storm he brewed! Common sense should have told him to use the organization\u2019s official channels and mind his language! Abuse of office everywhere!\n\n@ollynetworker, \u201c#rccg should suspend Leke Adeboye for calling ordained pastors #GOAT. What a gut.\u201d\n\n@OkeAkinola, \u201cThe goat in this context is to describe erring children who don\u2019t listen to fathers. A sheep is tender and easy to lead, a goat strays away at every slight opportunity.\u201d\n\n@CeciliaOkoroma, \u201cThis is simply not too nice a statement from \u2018man of God\u2019 and in particular, son of GO RCCG.\u201d\n\n@Joanna8214, \u201cThat\u2019s very rude of you, Leke Adeboye! You are the goat here.\u201d\n\n@TomisinAmokeoja, \u201cTwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right, Leke Adeboye calling pastors goat was way overboard. Really leaves much to be desired. Always been controversial though. I wonder how he would have reacted if he was the G.O.\u201d\n\n@influentialayyo, \u201cWhy is Leke Adeboye like this? He is always scandalous. Why will a Christian call the image of God a goat?\u201d\n\n@McRoi16, \u201cIt\u2019s rather unfortunate that he abused the privilege of being the G.O.\u2019s son.

          "text": ".\n\nAmbassador Khalifa Shuaibu, The President, Northern Advocacy for Peace (NAP) has condemned the attack on the forward operating base near Mando in Kaduna State.\n\nTerrorists in their numbers attacked the forward operating base of the military killing 17 soldiers and leaving over 20 badly injured. The terrorists set ablaze many military cars and carted away from a large cache of military weapons.\n\nAmbassador Khalifa Shuaibu regretted the destruction and boldness of the terrorists in the past month.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin Niger, Sokoto, Zamfara, Borno, Kebbi and Kaduna, terrorists have continued to kill, maim, destroy and kidnap citizens. Terrorists have imposed heavy taxes on several communities in the country as if the government has collapsed or there is no military to protect the sovereignty of the country.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Shuaibu, further, reiterated the earlier call of the group on President Buhari to sack the Chief of Defence Staff and the Chief of Defence intelligence. The group wondered why, at a forward military base, terrorists will engage military personnel for over 3 hours without a backup or reinforcement by the military.\n\n\u201cIt is surprising, to say the least, that, from available information in the public domain, these terrorists engaged personnel for over 3 hours without any backup. What has happened to our intelligence? He queried.\n\nThe group said with the bold attacks by the terrorists, there is a clear case of a collapse in the intelligence system or sabotage from some quarters in the military.\n\nRecently in Kaduna which hosts all the military formations, a deadly attack in the Kagoro local government area led to the death of over 34 civilians, 2 military personnel and several wounded people with property razed down.\n\nZamfara has become a theatre of murder and a boxing ring of deaths. Over 37 civilians were killed and over 62 kidnapped in Jugi and Doruwa in Bungudu local government. Similar killings occurred in Ganar- Kiyawa village in Bukkuyum local government recording deaths and kidnapping of over 20 members of the community.\n\nKebbi state has not been left out in these bloodletting attacks, 63 vigilantes were murdered and the deputy governor of the state was attacked by bandits leading to the death of 18 soldiers. Pockets of killings and attacks have continued in the state.\n\nSeveral local governments in Niger State are reportedly controlled by terrorists, armed groups and bandits, who visit communities with mayhem and destruction.\n\n\u201cThe military cannot protect Nigerians on the roads, on trains and on air. The terrorists kill and kidnap travellers in the entire sector and no one is resigning or sacked? The Chief of Defense Staff and his Chief of Defense Intelligence should resign or Mr President should sack them without delay and bring new officers who will face the ever-changing tactics of the terrorists\u201d\n\n\u201cMr President must Sack the CDS and the CDI immediately. They have lost touch with the war. Elsewhere, these officers would have ordinarily resigned for failure. Nigerians are becoming impatient with excuses and tired of the everyday deaths, destruction and kidnapping by terrorists in their own country. \u201cNAP said.\n\n\u201cWe have made several calls to President Buhari to save lives of citizens by sacking the CDS and CDI for new people who will man the offices and protect the citizens and sovereignty of the nation.

That is why the concept of consensus building is mostly used in conflict management because it is a veritable approach in resolving multi party differences.\n\n\u201cThere must be consensus building because Tinubu cannot be there without our consensus agreement. The issue here is that why must we be strategic.\n\n\u201cWe need to be strategic in our plans to achieve desired results and the only way Tinubu can get that ticket will be the application of strategic approach. Here we are developing strategies on how to market Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that when Tinubu was a Governor of Lagos State, his monthly subventions were seized by the Federal Government but Tinubu said they should take it because Lagos can survive without it.\n\n\u201cMany states cannot survive without subventions. But in the case of Tinubu, he was able to manage his state without subventions.\n\n\u201cHe was able to generate revenue. Most people believe that when Tinubu comes he will use that same approach to solve the endemic financial crises bedeviling the country.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Public Relations Officer of the Coalition, John Ali, said the roundtable discussion was an inclusive effort to sensitive it\u2019s members across the 19 Northern states on the quest to enthrone Tinubu as APC consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cThe aims and objectives of this programme is to sensitise members of the organization and the general public on the strategies of consensus building.\n\n\u201cAs grassroots mobilisers, we want to educate our members who are drawn from all states in the North so that they can take the message home on the need for consensus building and the quality leadership of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is one of the front runners of the 2023 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cWe are very hopeful that everything will come in favour of Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Apart from that we are ready to go into the primaries because of the mobilization we have done, we know we are everywhere. We are hopeful we are going to win even if they say come to the polls\u201d, he said.",

As a result of this unfounded allegation and the perceived political differences, our client and his supporters were arraigned before the High Court of Oyo State.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state, as it appears, that many people may forgotten what transpired on the night Chief Bola Ige was assassinated, that it was Chief Bola Ige himself who instructed his security guards to go and eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn spite of the wrongful persecution and incarceration of our client, he calmly defended himself in court, proved his innocence, and was rightly vindicated in the end.\n\n\u201cThe High Court of Oyo State, in its judgment, having looked at the whole evidence assembled against our client by the prosecution, found him not guilty of the alleged offence, and subsequently discharged and acquitted our client.\n\n\u201cThe said judgment of the court of competent jurisdiction exornerating our client is still valid, unchallenged, and stands till today.\n\n\u201cWe therefore, expect that through this letter, you will be better informed and take necessary steps to withdraw the earlier comments credited to your good self in the publication under reference.\u201d",

The good news for our teeming supporters of the PDP and Nigerians is that we have resolved and everyone of us, the 37 members unanimously adopted the position that we are going to present to NEC.\u201d\n\nAs members of the committee emerged from the meeting, many of them from the South wore long faces while their counterparts from the North beamed with smiles.\n\nWith the decision of the panel to throw the contest open, the coast is now clear for all the presidential aspirants, who have obtained the PDP nomination forms to contest in the presidential primary scheduled for May 28 and 29.\n\nHowever, it was not certain as at press time when the party\u2019s NEC would meet to consider the report of the committee.\n\nWhen contacted, the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) was yet to receive the report. He explained that immediately it does, machinery would be put in place to convene NEC meeting to ratify report.\n\nThose who have obtained nomination forms include Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, Akwa Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation( SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim. Others are former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former senate president, Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Oliver Diana Teriela; Nwachukwu Anakwenze; Ovation Publisher, Dele Mohammed, Sam Ohuabunwa and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\n\u2022We\u2019ll not relent\n\n\u2013Ohanaeze\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo has said it was not dampened by the decision to throw it open as it was hopeful a Southeasterner would clinch it at the end.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said Ohanaeze would continue to lobby the party.\n\n\u201cThey said they are throwing it open but we cannot stop lobbying them to see how they will understand that it is the turn of the Igbo. Even when APC is talking about South, we cannot stop in our efforts to continue to talk to their hearts to understand, it is a struggle that will continue. It is not a struggle you embark on and stop, it has a ripple effect now and after, so we have to be consistent in it. Even after the election, the struggle will continue that this is Igbo position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still lobbying, we are still speaking to Nigerians trying to convince them on the need for us to have an Igbo as President for peace and unity of the country, because when there is no peace and unity there can\u2019t be progress, there can\u2019t be what you call development. Sustainable national development cannot come when you don\u2019t have peace and unity and the bases of that that peace and unity is equity, fairness and justice. When you have justice, then you have peace and unity and sustainable development is a product of peace and unity, that is what we are saying.\u201d\n\n\u2022We\u2019ll campaign against northern candidate \u2013MBF\n\nMiddle Belt Forum (MBF) vowed to campaign against against any political party that fields a northerner as its presidential candidate.\n\nIts President, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, said they have principles and would always stand by them regardless of who is involved. He said the country has had a president from the North for eight years and it was only fair that power should return to the Southern part of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have been very consistent in our clamour for a president from the South and we have not changed our stance. President Muhammadu Buhari is from the north and he has ruled for eight years, so, this time around, the presidency should go to the South.\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear that the Middle Belt Forum has resolved to campaign against any political party that elects a presidential candidate from the north to contest the 2023 election. We will campaign against such a person and that is our final decision.\u201d\n\n\u2022You\u2019ve buried your votes \u2013 Southern youths\n\nThe Southern Nigeria Ethnic Youth Leaders Assembly (SNEYLA) said the decision would cost the party votes in the South East and South South.\n\nThe group gave PDP seven days to reconsider ceding PDP presidential tickets to South East or be ready to bear the grevious consequences of such injustice and marginalisation against Southeasteners.\n\nAccording to a statement by its National President, Felix Worlu: \u201cPDP has murdered sleep and they wouldn\u2019t sleep again in Southern Nigeria until the party is finally buried. There\u2019s no reason any PDP office/flag from ward level to state will be in the Southern Nigeria if they dare to deny a southeastern PDP president ticket.\n\n\u201cBy throwing PDP president ticket open, PDP has murdered justice, fairness and equity. Therefore, Southern Nigeria Ethnic Youth Leaders Assembly Shall apply every political means both conventional and unconventional to send a signal to PDP from the day of primary if they deny South East presidential Aspirants ticket\u2026PDP by their actions want to destroy Nigeria Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe built and the Nigeria General Yakubu Gowon fought for in 1967/70.\u201d\n\n\u2022Decision unfortunate, shameful \u2013Kokori\n\nFormer secretary general of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers Union (NUPENG), Chief Frank Kokori, described the decision as unfortunate and shameful.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a shame if the southern governors don\u2019t unite against this decision. You see, I don\u2019t want a situation where a northern Muslim would be contesting against a southern Christian because Nigeria is in a bad shape and people will think it is a war situation. We are not yet ripe for that kind of arrangement considering our multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-lingual differences.\n\n\u201cSo, it is unfortunate that the PDP has to go that way to shortchange the southerners who have been their main source of support for years. The southern people have virtually given more than 90 percent support to the PDP at every election year. So, it is for the southern PDP members to look at it critically and know what to do. But, I think they are being marginalised and if they don\u2019t know that they are being marginalised, then it is unfortunate for them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Decision self-destruct \u2013 Uwazurike\n\nFormer President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike said the move was not only a betrayal of the established norm, but a clear indication that the party was working to destroy itself.\n\n\u201cWhat the PDP did is a betrayal. It was the same thing they did in 2015 when they worked against former President Goodluck Jonathan. If they want to do the same thing in 2023 by not zoning the presidential ticket to the South, we shall see how the votes will go.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ilemona, Afegbua clash\n\nA PDP member from the North Central, Ilemona Onoja, said the decision would enable the party to present the most competent candidate who can win election for the party.\n\nHowever, former commissioner in Edo State, Kassim Afegbua said if the party has decided to go against zoning which is in its constitution, it equally has to remove zoning from its constitution to avoid litigation in future.\n\n\u201cOut of 62 years since independence, the north has ruled for 48 years while the south has only ruled for 14 years, so where is the equity, justice and fairness that some people are talking about,\u201d he argued.",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja and Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nBarely a week after terrorists killed eight and kidnapped scores of passengers aboard an Abuja-Kaduna-bound train, no fewer than 12 soldiers and three vigilante were feared killed, while 20 were injured in a fresh attack on a military base in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe terrorists believed to be over 200 had stormed the military base with heavy artillery gun fire and destroyed three Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) and overpowering troops stationed there.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nA source said the terrorists who wielded AK-47 and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) stormed the military base on motorcycles. He said the confrontation with soldiers lasted for about two hours before the soldiers were eventually subdued.\n\n\u201cWe lost 12 men while 20 soldiers were wounded in action. They also burnt down three armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) after they overwhelmed the troops. They also carted away several weapons from the troops,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe attack, it was learnt, has thrown the 1 Division of the Nigerian Army in Kaduna into confusion.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that while the 19 soldiers injured were rushed to the General Hospital, Birnin Gwari, the remains of the 12 soldiers were deposited at the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital, Kaduna.\n\nA military officer told Daily Sun that the attackers came from Shiroro in Niger State which has become a hot bed for terrorists. He said the attack has left the military devastated as the authority was thinking of how to break the news to families who lost soldiers during the attack.\n\nHe said Birnin Gwari, which used to be a hideout for bandits and other kidnappers, had been calm with heavy deployment of troops, until Monday night attack.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was no official statement from the police, army and the Kaduna State government on the attack.\n\nDirector, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, could not be reached as he is was said to have travelled with the Chief of Army Staff to the North East theatre of operations.\n\nHowever, a statement by the Chairman of the Birnin Gwari Emirate Progressive Union (BEPU), Ishaq Usman Kasai, confirmed the death of three vigilante, saying the attack took place around 3pm on Sunday.\n\nHe said the attackers were members of the Ansaru who are believed to have come in from Niger State.\n\n\u2018\u2019When we heard of it, we had to run and seek refuge elsewhere. Most of the residents slept outside Birnin Gwari town.\u201d\n\nHe said normalcy returned, yesterday, around 10am, describing the Kaduna /Birnin Gwari as the most dangerous road in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the army has said the volatile and complex security emergencies facing the nation has necessitated the continuous review of the national security architecture to contain the threats.\n\nChief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, made this known at the opening of a seminar on Intensifying Warriors Ethos, in Abuja.\n\nHe was represented by the Chief Of Policy and Plans (COPP), Major General Anthony Omozodje.\n\nThe COAS said the varied acts of insurgency, terrorism, kidnapping, banditry and other terrorist organisations have continued to pose substantive threats to the nation, but assured that troops have continued to \u201crespond assiduously to contain and decimate all adversaries of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nYahaya said the seminar put together by the Department Of Transformation and Innovation was aimed at boosting the fighting spirit of personnel deployed in the North East and other operational theatres across Nigeria.\n\nEarlier in his address, the Chief of Transformation and Innovation, Major General Charles Ofoche, said the seminar was organised to brainstorm and proffer practicable ways of imbibing warrior ethos in troops which encompasses the will, zeal and spirit to fight to the end. He said the re-invigoration of the fighting will is essential to building a formidable 21st Century Army.",

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria exceedingly troubled, says Okowa\n\n\u2022Govs, speakers meet Friday\n\n\u2022LCCI tasks FG to halt descent into lawlessness, anarchy\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Senate yesterday reiterated the need for President Muhammadu Buhari to, as a matter of urgency, declare total war on terrorists. The upper chamber stated this at plenary, when it also observed a minute\u2019s silence for those killed in a recent attack by bandits on Guni, Munyan Local Government Area of Niger State, which resulted in a boat mishap.\n\nDelta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, added his voice to the calls for drastic steps to address insecurity. Okowa spoke yesterday in Abekuta during a private visit to former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The governor said Nigeria was deeply troubled and needed the help of stakeholders to pull it back from the brink.\n\nThe senate noted with concern that the criminals engaged in massive killings and wanton destruction of property in Niger State, in particular, and Nigeria, in general. It directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide relief materials and medical teams to the surviving victims.\n\nThe resolutions of the senate were sequel to a motion, titled, \u201cRecent Bandit attack in Guni, Munyan Local Government Area of Niger State, resulting to Boat Mishap.\u201d\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) senator for Niger East, Senator Sani Musa, sponsored the motion.\n\nMusa came under Order 42 of the Senate Standing Order, as amended.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Senate notes that a boat conveying residents of Guni town capsized in Guni-Zumba River, killing about 20 persons escaping attacks by bandits in Niger State; notes also that the victims, including women and children from Guni in Munyan Local Government Area, were said to have lost their lives on Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201cObserves that the incident comes amid attacks by gunmen across communities in Niger State, which has resulted in killings, abductions, and displacement of scores of residents; observes also that the incident occurred when bandits simultaneously invaded the two communities, forcing the locals to flee;\n\n\u201cWorried that the attacks by armed groups have continued in the North-west and North-central Niger State, despite repeated government assurance to address the escalating atrocities; and\n\n\u201cWorried also that these unscrupulous elements have continued to issue statements via radio and people, security agencies, as well as the government, are all aware of their threats and nothing is being done.\u201d\n\nIn Abeokuta, Okowa said Nigeria was extremely troubled and needed the support of stakeholders to pull it back from the precipice.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by Special Assistant (Media) to Obasanjo, Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi, the governor noted that the troubled state of the country could destroy the economy, with unsavoury consequences for the citizens.\n\nThe statement said Okowa stressed the need for all citizens and well-meaning stakeholders to come together to think Nigeria first. He said the security situation in the country was threatening the fabric of its unity, \u201cand not something we have to play with.\u201d\n\nOkowa said, \u201cThe situation is getting worrisome and it\u2019s time we all have hands on deck to be able to find solution.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, the APC-run government cannot alone deal with the situation and they need to find wide and a far-reaching consultation, not with those in government alone, but all stakeholders, particularly those who have been part of running this country before and now, including even religious leaders.\u201d\n\nOkowa said Obasanjo and other former leaders and all stakeholders, including the country\u2019s traditional rulers, needed to be consulted to find a lasting solution to the insecurity and economic situation troubling the country. He said consultation was necessary because the situation of the country was getting messier on a daily basis.\n\nThe governor described Obasanjo \u201cas someone who truly understands Nigeria, saying Nigerians should be thanking God for having somebody like him.\n\n\u201cWe need to tap from him, especially at a time like this, which will help to shape this nation. And I thanked God for the wonderful discussions that I had with him,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his next steps after 2023, Okowa said he was yet to make up his mind on whether to contest the presidential election, saying, \u201cFinding solution to the nation\u2019s problem was more important than the presidential race for him.\n\n\u201cAs at today, I have not made up my mind. The important thing is not about myself, it is about the nation, Nigeria. The future of hope.\n\n\u201cWhat level of consensus can we build in order to achieve our dream? Our dream is to see Nigeria begin to have an improvement in our security and in the level of the economy. These are things we have not achieved at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe country is so stressed. There is so much stress in the land, so much unemployment, so much inflation and, unfortunately, the things that unite us are badly threatened and we cannot even be sure of tomorrow. These are the things we must discuss.\n\n\u201cWe must all come together to stop this drift at the moment, that is the type of things we should be more concerned about.\u201d\n\nGovernors, Speakers Meet Friday over Insecurity, Other National Issues\n\nWorried by the rising insecurity and tension across the country, governors of the 36 state of the federation and speakers of the Houses of Assembly have fixed an emergency meeting in Abuja on Friday. The meeting aims to discuss insecurity and other issues of national importance. Head, Media and Public Affairs, at the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Mr. Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja.\n\nBello-Barkindo said participants would brainstorm to find urgent solutions to pertinent issues of national importance.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that executive-legislature harmony would occupy the minds of the 72 people in attendance,\u201d Bello-Barkindo quoted the NGF Director-General, Mr. Asishana Okauru, as saying.\n\nLCCI Tasks FG to Halt Descent into Lawlessness, Anarchy\n\nLagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) called on President Muhammadu Buhari to convene a National Council of State meeting that would deliberate on the rising wave of insecurity in the country and its implications for Nigeria\u2019s democracy and economy.\n\nLCCI stated that the security challenges were, \u201cspiralling into general lawlessness and anarchy\u201d. It called on the federal and state governments to expedite actions to restore peace, law, and order in the country before the full-scale launch of political campaigns for the 2023 general election.\n\nIt warned that if Nigeria failed to \u201ccommit to a new order and a more enabled and innovative security architecture, soon, security will suffer a heavier blow once politics takes centre stage in governance,\u201d\n\nLCC1 said, \u201cThe major challenge waiting for the incoming Nigerian president (likely a civilian) will be to resolve the security crisis. Still, first, we must restore and preserve law and order in Nigeria today for us to be able to hold the elections next year.\u201d\n\nThese views were contained in a statement issued by the President of LCCI, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, on the, \u201cworsening security challenges,\u201d in which the chamber expressed serious concern that the current wave of insecurity in the country is having a telling impact on businesses and the Nigerian economy, adding that the trend is an apparent threat to the country\u2019s forthcoming general elections in 2023 and its democracy.\u201d\n\nOlawale-Cole stated that it would be challenging to hold credible, free, and fair elections that would reflect the choices of the electorate in the face of rising insecurity in the country.\n\nHe described the terrorists\u2019 attacks on the Kaduna airport and the Kaduna-Abuja-bound train last month as \u201cfrightening and increasingly threatening to the well-being of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOlawale-Cole said, \u201cAlso, the Global Conflict Tracker hosted by the United States Council on Foreign Relations recorded that attacks by bandits across the North-west have claimed at least 5,000 lives since 2018. Since 2009, nearly 350,000 people have been killed in the North-eastern part of the country due largely to the activities of Boko Haram Islamist insurgents. The number of displaced people in the Lake Chad Basin is about three million.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in Nigeria is multidimensional and pervasive, ranging from armed banditry, kidnapping, attacks on state infrastructure, perennial herder-farmer clashes to gang violence, attacks on police stations, prisons, airports, and power transformers, inter-communal violence, ritual killings, mob justice, and casual intimidation of ordinary citizens by the law enforcement agents.\u201d\n\nThe chamber also described what was currently going on in the South-south region, as, \u201can economic war as the government struggles to maintain the peace required to achieve optimal crude oil exploration for foreign exchange earnings. Nigeria earns about 80 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings from the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cThere are political agitations in the South-east, secessionist agitations in the South-west. Today, we have terrorism, banditry, and kidnapping in the northern part that have taken frightening dimensions and colorations.\u201d\n\nThe LCCI recommended, \u201cNigeria needs a surveillance infrastructure that is monitored in real-time to respond to emergencies and foil planned crimes. This calls for more technology deployment to gather intelligence, provide 24/7 responsive surveillance, and track persons\u2019 movements and activities, especially in already troubled areas.\u201d\n\nIt also identified youth unemployment as a critical factor fueling insecurity in Nigeria. The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that youth unemployment is at 42.5 per cent and youth underemployment at 21 per cent. \u201cThis is a driving factor for the insecurity crises in Nigeria. We need more jobs to engage our youths productively,\u201d the chamber said.\n\nThe LCCI stated that Nigeria must tackle gun control crisis, where unauthorised and unidentified people possess firearms without strict control.\n\nThe chamber said, \u201cIt is estimated that more than six million small arms are in the hands of civilian non-state actors.\n\n\u201cDrug abuse by our youth must be curtailed, and drug traffickers adequately prosecuted and punished as a deterrent.\n\n\u201cThe huge amount of N2.41 trillion earmarked for the defence and security sector in the 2022 budget might have reflected the government\u2019s commitment to resolving security challenges. We, however, need to be prudent with spending and put in place checks to prevent the diversion of funds to other uses like sponsoring political activities.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022DHQ confirms incident, yet to get full details\n\n\u2022Lawmakers meet service chiefs, IG, ministers behind closed doors\n\n\u2022El-Rufai: Nation at crossroads, we must get leadership right in 2023\n\n\u2022 Attack on one is attack on all, says Tinubu, donates N50m\n\nKingsley Nwezeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\n\n\n\n\nIn yet another mindless attack, this time on a military camp in Kaduna, terrorists, yesterday, killed about 15 soldiers and three civilians at Poll Wire, Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ), however, confirmed the attack but said it awaited further information.\n\nMeanwhile, the principal officers of the House of Representatives and Chairmen of Security Committees, yesterday, met behind closed doors with the service chiefs, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Inspector General of Police, Usman Akali Baba; and the Director General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi, over the recent terrorists\u2019 attack on Kaduna airport and train.\n\nThis is as the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has said Nigeria was currently at a critical crossroads and that the people must elect the right leaders in 2023 to take the country to the next level.\n\nIn the same breath, presidential hopeful and one of the national leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said an attack on one Nigerian was an attack on all Nigerians.\n\nHowever, yesterday\u2019s attack came a week after a commercial train was bombed in Kaduna, killing eight passengers, injured 26 while scores other passengers remained unaccounted for.\n\nThe terrorists, who were said to be traveling from Niger State to Zamfara in large numbers via Birnin Gwari, reportedly launched a deadly attack on the military camp.\n\nSources in Birnin Gwari, who confirmed the incident in a telephone chat, said the attack occurred at about 5pm on Monday, and that the terrorists, who were carrying sophisticated weapons, engaged the soldiers in a fierce gun battle at the camp.\n\nThe said the terrorists might have overpowered the soldiers due to their large numbers and went on to burn a military armoured tank at the camp.\n\n\u201cThe attack took place at a military camp at Poll Wire at about 5pm on Monday. They were in large numbers. They took more than an hour passing through the Kaduna highway. They were on their way from Niger State to Zamfara state.\n\n\u201cThey over powered the soldiers after a fierce gun battle probably because of their large numbers and the kind of weapons they carried.\n\nOne of the military armoured tanks was burnt.\n\n\u201cI am not in a position to confirm how many soldiers were killed, but information available to me said that 15 soldiers and three civilians were killed. Two of the civilians are members of a vigilante group while one was a traveller.\n\n\u201cYou can contact the military authorities to confirm the figures. The attack lasted for hours. These people were many and they have very sophisticated weapons. How do you expect maybe about 40 or 60 or even less soldiers manning a camp to face terrorists numbering about 100 or 200 and carrying deadly weapons?\u201d\n\nSpokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to calls when contacted.\n\nHowever, the spokesman at Defence Headquarters, Maj Gen Jimmy Akpor, confirmed the attack but said he was still awaiting further details.\n\nAlso, the Director, Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Bernard Onyeuko, confirmed the development and spoke in the same vein.\n\nLawmakers Meet Service Chiefs, IG, Ministers Behind Closed Doors\n\nHowever, at the resumed meeting of security stakeholders with the House of Representatives, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, who presided over the session, said the House was hoping to explore other options to tackle insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nSome identified government officials had last week shunned the invitation of the House at its last hearing. Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, who presided at the session, refused to allow the representatives to speak on behalf of their principals and bemoaned their absence, which compelled an adjournment.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Service Chiefs, Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, expressed readiness to answer questions from the lawmakers and said, \u201cWe are ready to answer the questions you have for us to proffer solutions to Defence and security issues across the country.\u201d\n\nThereafter, Gbajabiamila moved that the meeting be held behind closed doors and journalists were asked to leave the room.\n\nAddressing journalists five hours later, Gbajabiamila said they made good headway in their discussion but couldn\u2019t disclose what was discussed as security matters were not for public consumption.\n\n\u201cWe had an extensive deliberation. A lot of the issues were discussed there. Unfortunately, as defence matters, they were not things for public consumption. But I can assure you that there was a lot of collaboration. All ideas came together in terms of how our security agencies can work together and speak together in one voice as opposed to different voices.\n\n\u201cTalking about the all-important issue of whether or not there are elements within the military itself that we need to deal with \u2013 issues of moles like some have stated. We talked about training and retraining, issues of capacity and allowances. We talked about several things, a lot of them like I said touched on security.\n\n\u201cI am not at liberty at this point, but for us to have been in there for 4 to 5 hours, you must know that we made some good head way and extensive decisions were made. I am not happy going into the meeting, but I am happy coming out,\u201d the Speaker said.\n\nEl-Rufai: Nigeria at Crossroads, We Must Get Leadership Right in 2023\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, yesterday, concluded that Nigeria was at the moment at a critical crossroads, but that the people must elect the right leaders in 2023 to take the country to the next level.\n\nThe governor spoke, when one of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leaders, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, visited him in Kaduna to commiserate with him over the recent attack on a Kaduna-bound train.\n\nHe said the challenges presently bedeviling the country were human, and that they were not intractable, because they could be solved.\n\n\u201cWe need a society that can be just and equitable, where no group of people will lord it over others,\u201d the governor said.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai, who also harped on the presidential aspiration of As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu, said, \u201cWe are aware of your aspiration to lead this country. We look forward to further engagements on this.\u201d\n\nHe thanked As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu for the visit and for coming to commiserate with the state, saying, \u201cWe appreciate you. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAttack on One Nigerian is Attack on All, Says Tinubu\n\nA Presidential hopeful, Bola Tinubu, yesterday, said in Kaduna, Kaduna that an attack on one Nigerian was an attack on all in the country.\n\nSpeaking when he visited the state to commiserate with the government and people over last week\u2019s attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train, Tinubu urged all Nigerians to contribute their quota to efforts to rehabilitate the victims and prayed for a repose of the soul of those, who died in the incident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to sympathise with Governor Nasir el-Rufai and the people of the state over the train attack. It is a national disaster. It\u2019s a blow to all of us. Nigeria bleeds. We need to fight terrorism with all we have. I understand some people were killed while some others are missing. It is frustrating.\n\n\u201cThe governor is a symbol of our unity. Once in a while, we still remember the first stanza of our old national anthem \u2013 although tongues and tribes may differ, in brotherhood we stand. If enemies of peace and progress think they can deter us as a nation, we must together stand against them and say no,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe, however, donated the sum of N50million to cushion efforts to rehabilitate the victims of the attack and later visited the St Gerald\u2019s Hospital to see some of the victims.\n\nIn his responce, el-Rufai expressed gratitude to As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu for taking time to come and commiserate with the state and said the visit preempted his plan to come to Lagos to thank As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa for honoring the people of Kaduna State by canceling his 70th birthday on the day of the event because of the train disaster.\n\n\u201cThis gesture is a powerful show of leadership and empathy unprecedented in our national history. The government and people of Kaduna State will not forget this. We are grateful to you for your sacrifice and commitment to the greatness of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Presidential Options: The Die is Cast",
          "text": "\u2022Who amongst these aspirants will be chosen by Nigeria\u2019s changing electorate?\n\nA THISDAY Report\n\nA few weeks from now, two of these men \u2013 one each from the two main political parties \u2013 would emerge presidential candidates of their respective parties and dominate the political space in the countdown to the 2023 presidential run.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria boasts some 18 political parties, out of which less than five are truly active. But the season is here again and it\u2019s expected that a majority, if not all, would start to activate their machines in readiness for the 2023 general election.\n\nWhile many of the parties might field candidates for different elective offices, the possibility that a majority others would either form alliance or endorse the presidential candidates of either of the two major parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 is equally high.\n\nTherefore, about some eight weeks from now, all the serious parties would start to hold their presidential primaries and be ready with their candidates in the countdown to the big event \u2013 the presidential bout \u2013 in February 2023.\n\nAhead of the presidential primaries, however, some presidential hopefuls have started to openly indicate their interests in the nation\u2019s number one job, while a few others, who were deemed to be interested but have yet to say so, have equally hinted at the possibility, one way or the other.\n\nBut, their presidential aspiration aside, the fact of the moment is that the nation is in dire straits and there has never been a more urgent need to rescue Nigeria than it is now. Perhaps, the situation in Nigeria pre-2015 was nothing compared to the current situation, even though it necessitated the \u201cchange mantra\u201d that brought in the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nChallenged on all fronts \u2013 the same grounds the ruling APC travelled to power \u2013 the country has been hopping from increasing insecurity to a tottering economy and burgeoning corruption. Although the work of a president may not be physically demanding as does a bricklayer, it requires a degree of physical fitness and high mental alertness, to be able to address what is currently on the card in Nigeria.\n\nPerhaps, the search for a messiah is back on stream and this time, the same opportunity, which presented itself in 2015, is showing up again except the Nigerian people choose to miss out on it, this time. There is a fierce urgency for a new leadership to steer the country away from the abyss to and redirect the ship of stay in a new direction. It starts with a carefully made presidential choice in 2023. This has become inevitable.\n\nThus, while zoning as a factor cannot be discarded arrogantly under whatever account or pretext, since it has become a critical glue holding the nation\u2019s many tendencies together, the quality of the candidate needed to do the job, has become more compelling if the current search for a president for all Nigerians is altruistic.\n\nAgainst this backdrop are a few of those, who have so far indicated interest in the presidency of Nigeria in 2023 \u2013 some of them are familiar names \u2013 and hopefully, the Nigerian people can find from amongst them, that individual, who understands the issues and knows what the problems are, and has a good and clear idea what solutions fit.\n\nAnyim Pius Anyim (PDP, South East)\n\nA former President of the Senate and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim, has had those two huge platforms to showcase himself. An indigene of Ebonyi State, Anyim is one presidential hopeful, who has stayed away from scandals and maintained a lowkey profile. Although since leaving public office, he was completely tucked into his private life until activities ushering in 2023 picked up, he has also explained at every given opportunity that he understands Nigeria and can fix the problems.\n\nStrengths: He has experience and probably still keeps some good contacts after leaving office. He is from the South East, a zone that has consistently alleged marginalisation.\n\nWeaknesses: He seems a bit laidback for the task at hand and lacks colour. His acceptability within his South East is also a subject of debate, and that could challenge his national presence.\n\nAminu Tambuwal (PDP, North West)\n\nThe current two-term Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, was speaker of the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. He used his era as speaker to challenge some of the unfavourable policies of the former president Goodluck Jonathan administration, and that made him very popular. Although his governorship has not been anything spectacular, he has continued to leverage more, his days as speaker.\n\nStrengths: Naturally, coming from the core north often confers some advantage, and this is in addition to the fact that he is young and vibrant. He also wields some influence amongst his colleagues, being the chairman of PDP governors\u2019 forum.\n\nWeaknesses: Tambuwal has never been in the cluster of those considered as having the experience and maturity to face the nation\u2019s challenges. Being speaker and governor are not enough, he has yet to acquit himself as a potential presidential material. They are not the same.\n\nAtiku Abubakar (PDP, North East)\n\nA foremost presidential material, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, has always been in the forefront of the charge to lead the country. Indeed, in 2015, many held the view that he was the most prepared with clear ideas what he needed to do and where. The Turaki Adamawa is a household name and has all it takes to change the current narrative.\n\nStrengths: He has the experience, capacity and competence to address Nigeria\u2019s problems. He also knows Nigeria well enough and can balance the fault lines without crossing the lines.\n\nWeaknesses: Atiku has always had this never disappearing corruption tag, which mere explanations have refused to clear off. There are also questions about his age and health. Above all, he is categorised as part of the old order that brought Nigeria to its knees.\n\nBala Muhammed (PDP, North East)\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed is a first term governor and former Minister of the FCT. Although still in office, there\u2019s a general belief he has not used his opportunities to stand out at these other levels. Age is still on his side and he\u2019s promising. A product of some highwire local politics, which witnessed the alignment of the opposition in the state, Mohammed has yet to find his feet well, even as governor.\n\nStrengths: He is from a part of the north, which thinks it has been marginalised enough and therefore, deserves a shot at the presidency. He also has age on his side and from a party, which might throw its presidential ticket open for all.\n\nWeaknesses: He does not command the kind of national presence required of a man aspiring to the highest office in the land. A man still grappling with the needs of small Bauchi, cannot be handed the intimidating challenges of Nigeria. Nigeria at this time cannot try anyone, who might want to learn on the job. Besides, there\u2019s the speculation that he would rather return as governor than gamble with uncertainty.\n\nBukola Saraki (PDP, North Central)\n\nTwo-terms former governor of Kwara State, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, was President of the Senate between 2015 and 2019, a platform which availed him an opportunity to sell himself. Unlike many before him, Saraki made the office of the senate president very attractive and also drew attention to the fact that there was so much power and influence in being the nation\u2019s number three citizen. His days as senate president also showed him off as a dogged fighter, who despite the various traps set in his way, triumphed, defeating the corruption label that his opponents had tried to hang on his neck.\n\nStrengths: He has shown capacity, competence and has experience also going for him. He clearly understands the issues and at every turn, has always intervened in the Nigerian project, proffering solutions to those knotty national concerns, even as a floor senate member. He connects more with the youth and very much in tune with global trends. His zone, the north central, has been in the trenches for recognition, having been marginalised for many years. They consider now as their time.\n\nWeaknesses: His state of origin, which is now being seen as a form of strength, politically, is the first factor to count against him. Small Kwara in north central has always been hard to place, either as a northern or southern state, realistically. Besides, coming out at a time the clamour for southern presidency is on high note, is a tough call.\n\nBola Tinubu(APC, South West)\n\nA political juggernaut by every definition, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is by all standards, one of the biggest names in the nation\u2019s political lexicon today. From a relatively unknown Bola in 1999 to becoming the national leader of the ruling APC, today, Tinubu is a force to reckon with. Not only has he built an empire, he has made people and raised soldiers across all ages, walks of life and political leanings. Heavily connected and boasting huge war chest that could unsettle any cause, Tinubu is a political samurai, underestimated only at the peril of his opponents. In addition to commanding experience and competence, Tinubu has an enviable foresight for reading the political barometer, near accurately every season. In South West and beyond, he is an idol to many would-be politicians. He is a kingmaker, who now desires to be king.\n\nStrengths: Highly connected. Has experience and capacity. He seems prepared for what he called his life-long ambition to be president of Nigeria. He has the money required to prosecute his election. He has national presence. Understands some of the issues. Has a fatherly demeanor and the patience for the job. If not stopped by the Villa, he could claim the presidency without a fight.\n\nWeaknesses: Tinubu is largely considered corrupt and it\u2019s almost a consensus. He is one man, who is deemed rich, yet, has no known businesses to his name. Even the businesses marked against his name are easily denied, because they are believed to be held in trust. He is also old, sickly and weak. Age and health have taken their tolls and may be unable to stand the demands of the office. His mental alertness has been called to question many times. Also the Buhari albatross hangs on his neck. He and a clique within the APC brought Buhari. It is now almost like a cardinal sin that he brought Buhari. Can Nigeria afford the Alphabetarisation of Nigeria? He has a 60 million dollars private aircraft with no clear means of income; no factory employing people. Where did the money come? He has not been able to explain to the country he is striving to govern. Explaining his source of wealth becomes a big challenge on his road to becoming President of Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nDavid Umahi(APC, South East)\n\nOutgoing Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, is about the only Southeast governor in the APC, who is desirous of succeeding President Buhari. Umahi, whose seat was recently threatened by the judgment of a Federal High Court, which sacked him before it was reversed at the appellate court, is believed to have done relatively well, when compared to some of his colleagues. An engineer by calling, he is one of those, who had openly indicated interest in the job, following after Tinubu.\n\nStrengths: Coming from the South East, the zone has continued to justify why it should be allowed to produce the president in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice. Records have also shown that he is a man of ideas and can champion developments. And, in terms of age, he would pass.\n\nWeaknesses: A recluse by simple definition, Umahi does not really have friends. Apart from compelling meeting of governors, his media exposure says as much. That also presupposes some tribalistic tendencies and definitely not what is needed at a time like this. His contacts are limited and therefore, boasts poor reach.\n\nDele Momodu (PDP, South South)\n\nOne of the most influential celebrity journalists in Nigeria\u2019s modern history, Bashorun Dele Momodu, is having his second outing in the nation\u2019s presidential run. His first outing, which didn\u2019t turn out good, was enough to have discouraged anyone from wanting to serve again, but Momodu\u2019s love for country would not let him look away. Publisher of the prestigious Ovation Magazine, which is sold across the world, has such contacts that only a few politicians can lay claims to. Sound, brilliant, capable and armed with requisite experience, the second coming of this Edo-born journalist and politician, is a welcome development in the scheme of things.\n\nStrengths: Young, experienced, capable and competent, Momodu is a quintessential global citizen, with friends and contacts across the world. His presidency can easily access his contacts in nation\u2019s interest and devote such to development purposes.\n\nWeaknesses: He does not have the kind of money needed to prosecute this kind of election. Politicians, and particularly, owners of Nigeria may not be willing to trust him with power.\n\nUdom Emmanuel (PDP, South South)\n\nThe current and outgoing governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, is one of the prides of PDP, given his development initiatives in the state, even though taking off was easy, because of the kind of legacy left behind by his predecessor, and Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who was famous for uncommon transformation. Udom has spent the last eight years, etching his footprints in the sand of time, a legacy of achievements, which has stoked him into wanting to serve at a higher pedestal.\n\nStrengths: He has shown capacity, experience, and maturity in tending to state matters. His ability to manage his predecessor and former benefactor as a major tendency is a plus that cannot be glossed over. Coming from the south is also an additional strength to his rating as a presidential hopeful.\n\nWeaknesses: Managing a relatively small Akwa Ibom is not a template that is applicable to managing Nigeria, because national politics differs significantly from regional ludo games. Besides, he is in a zone and party, where he can easily be muscled in terms of political advantage by the other big guns. He has to up his game, regardless.\n\nGodwin Emefiele (South South)\n\nAlthough the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, is from Delta, a South-south state; he is by providence, standing astride in both the South-south and the South East, thus, making his candidacy appealing to two critical zones that feel entitled to the presidency. The nation\u2019s economy has no doubt, been challenged in different ways, a sector in which Emefiele plays a significant role as the CBN governor; that the nation has not been overwhelmed, however, speaks to his efforts at mitigating those challenges. It was not by accident that the nation snapped out of recession twice to the shock of experts. It was also not sheer happenstance that Covid-19 did not shut down the economy. Some people stood in and plugged it. Kudos to the roles played by Emefiele in these and many respects. No doubt, these also accounted for the growing clamour that he should join the race. While he has yet to declare, Emefiele\u2019s supporters are damn certain he is the right man for the job.\n\nStrengths: A technocrat, whose time may have come, leading Nigeria with experience, and with insecurity linked to economy, he is believed to have the understanding of Nigeria\u2019s economy and issues challenging the country to be able to steer the affairs of state if gets the keys to the Villa. Another major factor going for him, is that he is trusted by the northern establishment who see him as someone they can work with.\n\nWeaknesses: First, he has the political class to contend with given his background. Politicians may not be too comfortable with him. He is from a minority South-south, a state controlled by the opposition. Emefiele lacks political base to command strong loyalty. Being a technocrat is also a weakness for him, as he is not seen by politicians as one of them, even if former President Olusegun Obasanjo was able to weather those storm in 1999\n\nIbikunle Amosun (APC, South West)\n\nFormer governor of Ogun State for eight years and senator representing Ogun central for a second term, Ibikunle Amosun, is one of the few contenders, who is very hands-on, firm and assertive. Progressive with development ideas, Amosun changed the face of Ogun in eight years so much that it might take decades to surpass his records. A grassroots politicians with intimidating machine in the politics of his state, his 2019 experience has not displaced him from the current equation in his state as the number one politician. A very good friend of the president, Amosun boasts the kind of contacts that are hard to link to him, except for close allies. He\u2019s got capacity, competence, experience, ideas and very futuristic.\n\nStrengths: His ideas are always taking into account, the foreseeable future. He is quietly friends with both the north and the south. Unknown to many, he is also friends with so many foreign presidents and never will flaunt them. He is very comfortable and has the wherewithal to prosecute his election, particularly, by pulling his friends up onto the field.\n\nWeaknesses: He is seen as very stubborn, although often times on principle. He has the penchant for disregarding processes and protocols if it would stand in the way of an idea he thought was meant to benefit the people. One of his major support pillars is Buhari and if his 2019 experience was to be factored into consideration, he can as well cancel out Buhari from his support base.\n\nKayode Fayemi (APC, South West)\n\nChairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has always distinguished himself in many respects. As a quintessential Omoluabi of the Yoruba extraction, he has used his office to prove that there is nothing esoteric about leadership. And, as a politician, who has learnt from his ugly experience, his politics has also been so elevated that, whoever underrates Fayemi now, might be doing so at very costly expense. Think all the boxes: capacity, competence, experience, networking, international contacts, ideas, development, focus, and blending across generations \u2013 Fayemi ticks them all. What\u2019s more? A ready-made presidential material.\n\nStrengths: He has learnt national politics so well and upgraded his local politics even more. How he has managed the governors from other parties is a case study. He knows the issues and would put them on the global stage almost effortlessly.\n\nWeaknesses: Coming from a rather small Ekiti, the kind of alignment required to build alliances could be frustrated by other states in the zone in an effort to undo him from clinching the ticket. He does not have the war-chest for the project, although could raise it through friends. Also, surviving the few months to the general election after leaving office is a major counter to his aspiration, as some of the things that currently count in his favour could be lost to being out of office.\n\nMohammed Hayatu-Deen(PDP, North East)\n\nA former Managing Director of the now defunct FSB International Bank, Mr. Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, recently joined the presidential race for 2023, after declaring for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). An economist, banker and former Chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Hayatu-Deen started his career working in principal investments and project finance at the Northern Nigeria Development Corporation, later rechristened New Nigeria Development Corporation (NNDC), which at the time was Nigeria\u2019s largest industrial holding company with investments across a range of industries.He rose from there to the position of Group Chief Executive and was responsible for providing leadership, direction, and oversight to 140 subsidiary and associate companies under the group portfolio. His career therefrom blossomed significantly.\n\nStrengths: With a sound background in economics, coupled with a successful career in the banking sector, his experience would certainly come handy in remedying some of the nation\u2019s current economic challenges. He also boasts some maturity that could help on the job, aside coming from Borno, North East, thus enjoying both party and zone advantage.\n\nWeaknesses: Given an exposure largely rooted in the private sector, it comes with its challenges. Contending with political forces, who see such persons as coming to steal what\u2019s theirs is almost certain. His background has also limited his connection in a sense.\n\nNyesom Wike (PDP, South South)\n\nThe controversial Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has many limitations, especially with respect to his attitudinal disposition, but certainly not in terms of performance. It is almost a consensus that he has worked hard to take Rivers to a different level in terms of infrastructure development. He also understands politics very well, even though his style is crude. He has equally managed to extend his hold beyond the Rivers hemisphere. It is also not for jokes that many call him Mr. Projects.\n\nStrengths: Being governor of an oil rich Rivers is in itself a lot of advantage. It was a Rivers governor in the person of Rotimi Amaechi, who made Buhari\u2019s presidency possible in 2015. Wike has a lot of money and through his money, he has been able to buy loyalties and friends. This also accounts for why his reach transcends Rivers. He also has signature projects, which means he is not just presumed to be rascally; he is also development-focused.\n\nWeaknesses: Wike, without a doubt, lacks the character befitting of the office of the president. In every of his engagements, he throws decorum to the wind and treats his colleagues as if they are subservient. Unmindful of his integrity (if any), Wike is too reckless about his carriage. While he could actually undo many things, because of his money, he hardly can find the requisite support for his aspiration amongst his peers.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu (APC, South East)\n\nThe Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, started his political career with an eye on a senate seat in the old Imo State on the platform of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). He also contested for the position of Governor of Abia State in 1991, as candidate of the National Republican Convention and won. He was sworn in as the first Executive Governor of the State in January 1992, and was the first chairman, Conference of Nigerian elected Governors. In 1999, he was the presidential standard bearer of the All People\u2019s Party (APP), but relinquished the position to Olu Falae after a merger of his party with the Alliance for Democracy (AD), who lost to Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP. Ogbonnaya went on to become the National Chairman of the APP in 2010. In 2013, his party successfully merged with the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and some members of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to form the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nStrengths: He has come a long way with a lot of experience, maturity, and networking. He is also from the South East, a zone that has been marginalised over time in the scheme of things. He a good ambassador of the Igbo.\n\nWeaknesses: Many believe he is not hands-on and his ideas are not in tune with modern day realities. He might be too laidback for the task ahead. His ideas are believed not to be sound.\n\nPeter Obi(PDP, South East)\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State and businessman, Peter Obi, has such ideas about how a state should run and those ideas always resonate with the ordinary people. A vice-presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 election, he has moved closer to the presidency than many from the his zone. Although he is wrestling with the zoning ideas like others, he has shown capacity, experience and huge understanding of the issues that are wrong with the nation state.\n\nStrengths: He knows the issues and almost has the solutions off-the-top of his head. He has built friends both in the private and public sectors and is very rich too, even though he embraces a spartan lifestyle.\n\nWeaknesses: With no home-zone support, it\u2019s a tall order to ride roughshod over others to clinch the ticket, much less the presidency. Some of his friends also think he is a pretender and often dismissed him as not bankable.\n\nRotimi Amaechi (APC, South South)\n\nThe Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, is often described as the \u201cstar boy\u201d of the administration, given the revolution going on in the rail sector of the economy as well as the maritime sector. A former governor of Rivers State, Amaechi has a record of performance and discharging every assignment well. It is no wonder that he is constantly stealing the show in this administration through his development initiatives. Although his efforts are being undermined lately by the activities of terrorists, none of those has stifled him from that which he thought would benefit a majority of the people. Thus, exhibiting capacity, experience and competence, he has held the transport ministry for almost eight years and to the awe of his principal and the people in general. From being speaker for eight years, governor for eight years and now minister for almost eight years, there is no question about his experience in governance and development.\n\nStrengths: He has capacity, competence and the exposure to do the job. He is also very hands-on and very much development-focused. He is a good politician, understands the issues, and can network easily. He has friends across all ages, sectors and affiliations and has money to do the election the same way he did Buhari\u2019s. He is also nice, kind and compassionate. Like Emefiele, his candidacy too stands on both the Southeast and the South-south.\n\nWeaknesses: He is stubborn and can be abrasive sometimes. He takes loyalty seriously and when there\u2019s a tinge of alleged mistrust, he could go off, sometimes without double-checking. There is the home-zone disadvantage too, although he seems to be making up for that with his ministerial posting.\n\nTimipre Sylva (APC, South South)\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, is another South-south presidential hopeful, but from Bayelsa State. A former governor, Sylva has relative executive experience to want to try the presidency of Nigeria. He also has a platform to build a network of friends, locally and internationally, using patronage effectively.\n\nStrengths: He is minister of petroleum and may find it easy to muster the war chest for his campaign. Experience too comes to play for him and capacity is arguable. Also, being from the South is an advantage.\n\nWeaknesses: He is largely drawn away from his colleagues and his network of friends can actually be thrown up for a debate. The petroleum ministry has not been doing well lately and the fact that they are still approbating and reprobating over subsidy removal questions his capacity by extension, even though he is not the principal minister. He too has the home-zone disadvantage.\n\nYahaya Bello(APC, North Central)\n\nThe Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, is another controversial governor, albeit in the ruling party. Almost eight years in office, Bello is grappling with some of the mundane issues of governance. Failing to apply discretion in some of his choices appears to be the hallmark of his leadership. Not many would forget in a hurry how he almost made a mess of the fight against Covid-19, at a time the world came together to battle the scourge. With unpaid salaries and pensions in the region of billions, which have not been given sufficient attention like his ambition, it\u2019s not difficult to ponder a good mental picture of what his presidency might look like.\n\nStrengths: He is young, energetic and has the capacity to throw money around at the expense of real governance issues.\n\nWeaknesses: Coming from the north attracts a resounding no in APC, after Buhari, another northerner\u2019s eight years. He delights to relish in issues that are lacking in substance. Governance has suffered under his watch and his colleagues just let him spawl further in his folly by strategically avoiding him. Save for those interested in his money, mustering a decent crowd for his ambition is almost impossible.\n\nYemi Osinbajo (APC, South West)\n\nHe is the current vice president of the country and a man that a lot of people, would have gladly agreed should step in after Buhari, since he would have worked with him for eight years. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has come of age in politics in just eight years. Indeed, he\u2019s practically graduated from the school of strategic politics. He now knows the game as much as its older actors. Barring any last minute changes, he is billed to declare his interest in the presidency any moment from now. One of his foot soldiers, Kayode Ajulo, hinted at this yesterday, when he shared a post, which read: \u201cOn your marks, oh my comrades, what we await and strive for is here. Oh, my comrades, hear the sound; so loud over landscape. Reprieve now appearing; victory is nigh. #PYOIsComing. #FileFunYemi. #RamadanKareem. #PYO23 #ProgressiveLawyers4PYO.\u201d\n\nFrom the many assignments he has been detailed, he has done well. So far, he has conducted himself so well, and even though he has not said a word, he has communicated his intention to run a long time ago. He has confidence, capacity, exposure and competence. Above all, he carries himself so presidentially and with cerebral demeanor, that he unsettles his traducers.\n\nStrengths: He is from the Southwest and as the current vice-president, he has leveraged a very good use of his office to the disadvantage of other aspirants. He has built a network of friends, contacts and connection across the world. He has shown to understand the issues and always propounds the solutions at any given opportunity.\n\nWeaknesses: First, running against Asiwaju is waiting to count majorly against him in the politics of the zone, even though such sentiment belies logic. But the narrative of a betrayal has been established successfully. Two, most of the friends and contacts he has built are \u2018office friends\u2019 and might fizzle out once they perceive that things might not go his way. Osinbajo may have to answer to questions about alleged bigotry as many people have continued to accuse him of giving preference to members of his church, the RCCG, at every turn and populating his office with them. Some politicians accuse him of not being honest and habitually double-faced.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan (PDP, South-South)\n\nDr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is a former president, who lost his bid for re-election and handed over to the incumbent in 2015. His political career began in 1998, when he was chosen by the late Diepreye Alaimeyeseigha as his running mate. The Alaimeyeseigha/Jonathan ticket won the election and he became the first civilian deputy governor of Bayelsa State on May 29, 1999. In 2005, he was sworn in as governor after his then boss ran into trouble with the law. In 2007, he won the PDP gubernatorial primary in Bayelsa State and was in the midst of his campaign, when he was nominated as vice presidential candidate to the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019 Adua and as fate would have it, he became president after Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s demise, following prolonged ill-health. In 2011, he was elected president.\n\nGoodluck Jonathan became President on the PDP platform in his first term. The question on the lips of many now is should he decide to run this time, under which platform will he be running? Will it be under the PDP that gave him his first taste of power or will he switch party to the APC as is being speculated? This remains unclear, although he is currently a member of PDP.\n\nStrengths: He is trusted by the present administration, because of the way he handed over power. He is a democrat and adherent of the rule of law. As president, he promoted pro-people policies, especially, programmes such as the Almajiri schools he built in the North. He is also respected among the African leaders, because of efforts he has made to restore peace on the continent since he left office.\n\nWeaknesses: He is perceived to be a weak leader, who was controlled by women, when he was in power, leading to his electoral loss in 2015. However, it is not clear if\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "title": "Alleged Billionaire Debtor: Contractors Accuse 6th Richest African, Mike Adenuga Of Failing To Pay Multi-million Dollar Company\u2019s Debts, Petition Nigerian Government",
          "text": "Some contractors of Conoil, an oil and gas conglomerate owned by Nigerian billionaire, Mike Adenuga are currently frustrated over the consistent failure of the firm to honour its debts.\n\nAdenuga, chairman of Globacom, a telecommunications company, was at the time of filing this report ranked Nigeria's second richest man and Africa\u2019s sixth richest by Forbes.\n\nAdenuga has an estimated worth of $7.4 billion.\n\nHis mobile phone network, Globacom, is the third-largest operator in Nigeria, with 55 million subscribers while his oil exploration outfit, Conoil Producing, operates 6 oil blocks in the Niger Delta.\n\nHowever, the contractors in different letters to the Chief of Staff to the President, Ibrahim Gambari and Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Timipre Marlin Sylva called for an investigation into \u201cthe tragic state\u201d of Conoil.\n\nIn some of the letters, exclusively obtained by Sahara Reporters, they described executives of the Adenuga-owned conglomerate as deriving sadistic pleasure from reneging on payments, and the firm of failing to properly maintain multi-million dollar platforms, in short becoming a rudderless shadow of its former self.\n\nThe creditors pointed to joint ventures by the Nigerian government and Conoil which they said have been a dismal failure, leaving host communities and the public purse out of pocket.\n\nSteve T, Ejejigbe and Emiko Jaiye, Managing Directors of Stevicnel Enterprises and Ikengbesimi Ventures Limited respectively, wrote to Sylva on March 7, 2022.\n\nThey told the minister Stevicnel is owed N50,429,698.83, while Ikengbesimi is due the payment of N169,710,837.62.\n\nIn barely contained fury, they said their companies were not alone in being owed money, since Conoil \u201chas a renowned penchant of refusing to pay its bills.\u201d\n\nThe pair added, \u201cIts board and senior management engage in all manner of underhanded business malpractices to ensure that contractors are not paid. Sina Olonade, Conoil\u2019s Head of Commercial, is the spearhead for such unsightly behaviour, taking what can only be described as a sadistic joy in toying with the heats of desperate contractors whilst their businesses and livelihoods steadily crumble right before his eyes.\u201d\n\nTurning to the Obodo Field, which both companies worked on between 2019 and 2021, the pair claimed it is \u201cgrossly mismanaged\u201d and that despite it being owned by the Nigerian government, and Conoil being no more than a general contractor, the company has failed to develop the site at all.\n\nThey added that it has yet to produce a single barrel of oil in the 15 years that ConOil has been associated with the project.\n\nThis they alleged has caused such division within the host communities that contractors have been kidnapped and held for ransom.\n\nAccording to Messrs Ejejigbe and Jaiye: \u201cWe can no longer understand the modus operandi of Conoil as an organisation and have concluded that it is no longer in business to be a credible, sound, and diligently run organisation but that is now a shadow of its former self, lost and misguided on a daily basis in what its core function as a company should be.\u201d\n\nThese firms are not alone in voicing their discontent with Conoil. Another letter obtained by SaharaReporters also documented how Transcontinental Integrated Services Limited was owed N234,676,843 (Two hundred and thirty-four million, six hundred and seventy-six thousand, eight hundred and forty-three naira) and was also scathing about Olonade and his colleagues.\n\nWritten by the company\u2019s MD, Edekin Dickson Odion, and addressed to the President\u2019s Chief of Staff, the letter dated February 28, 2022, documented the general problem once again of getting ConOil to pay up for services received.\n\nOdion said, \u201cThese struggles that we went through are now a common problem in the oil & gas industry, driven by a simple notion and denomination - Conoil refuses to pay contractors for works done. Its management team, spearheaded by the likes of Sina Olonade, derive an abhorrent joy in making contractors beg and plead for their outstanding(s) while making blatantly false promises to make payment and after which all communication from ConOil on the matter ceases to exist.\u201d\n\nHe said what shocked him and his colleagues was how the firm continues to tender for multi-billion US dollar contracts when \u201cIt is well known within the industry that Conoil's production platforms & infrastructures at both its OML 59 & 103 sole risk assets are in a vastly deteriorating and crumbling state with a desperate need for a total overhaul.\u201d\n\nFurther evidence that these are not isolated cases comes from another letter sent to Gambari by Lenimar Ocean Trawlers Limited.\n\nChidi Joe, Executive Director, Operations, wrote that it had been owed N283,929,973.20 from as far back as 2015.\n\nJoe added, \u201cAll efforts by us to get these outstanding funds paid have proved futile. Conoil has a reputation well known in the industry of being a serial debtor, and even when presented with the significant amount of sums owed, its Board and management go to extreme lengths to ensure that contractors are not paid.\u201d\n\nAnother letter has also emerged from Armeco Waste Containers, dated October 21, 2021, to ConOil\u2019s contracting arm, Belbop Nigeria Limited, complaining of assaults on its staff members at the Obodo site.\n\nAccording to the letter, two staff members \u2013 Nga Perkins Efamdi (site safety officer) and Hapi Mayomitsn (speed boat operator) have been missing since 19th October 2021 and their abductors are demanding a ransom of N100,000.00 (One hundred million naira) payment.\n\nArmeco goes on to state that it is suspending operations and withdrawing its personnel from the site until the abducted staff members are released and adequate security measures are put in place.\n\nThe decision by the various firms to attempt to get the government to intervene marks a new dramatic development in the Adenuga debt controversies.\n\nHistory Of Amassing Debts\n\nLast October it was revealed that Conpurex, a wholly-owned Conoil subsidiary, was being pursued by creditors over a debt of more than USD $7 million.\n\nBut even then, lawyers acting for the companies owed money were confining their entreaties to executives working under Adenuga.\n\nAnd whereas many of his bills and invoices previously reneged by Conoil involved foreign companies, this time around it is domestic companies employing the local workforce who are in peril.",

People who knew me were the judges and the lawyers in the court, and they said where did you bring this candidate from. And it was clear to me that the only way I was going to connect to the people was during that debate,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDebates should take place in places like university campuses where some of the debates take place in the US. I think labour groups, manufacturers groups, interest groups, can organise debates.\n\n\u201cIf there are candidates who seriously want to get the votes of those people, these are the platforms to speak to them.\n\n\u201cIf a candidate persuades me at a debate, I\u2019d likely go out to vote for him.\n\n\u201cOn election day, what you\u2019re probably likely to see is a ballot paper with the signs, symbols, possibly the names of the candidates, but doesn\u2019t tell you what they do about your life, what they care about, how you feed them, doesn\u2019t tell you whether they are God-fearing, whether they have empathy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo it is platforms like this that help you test ahead of making a choice, what kind of persons you are entrusting the most serious jobs either in your local government, your state or in your country.

People who knew me were the judges and the lawyers in the court, and they said where did you bring this candidate from. And it was clear to me that the only way I was going to connect to the people was during that debate,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDebates should take place in places like university campuses where some of the debates take place in the US. I think labour groups, manufacturers groups, interest groups, can organise debates.\n\n\u201cIf there are candidates who seriously want to get the votes of those people, these are the platforms to speak to them.\n\n\u201cIf a candidate persuades me at a debate, I\u2019d likely go out to vote for him.\n\n\u201cOn election day, what you\u2019re probably likely to see is a ballot paper with the signs, symbols, possibly the names of the candidates, but doesn\u2019t tell you what they do about your life, what they care about, how you feed them, doesn\u2019t tell you whether they are God-fearing, whether they have empathy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo it is platforms like this that help you test ahead of making a choice, what kind of persons you are entrusting the most serious jobs either in your local government, your state or in your country. And that became very defining for me as a much younger person.\u201d",

          "text": "Amid the chaotic buildup to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the fortunes of the party ahead of the 2023 general election appeared to be hanging in the balance.\n\nHowever, on the day of the convention, the party\u2019s leadership resolved to adopt the consensus method in selecting candidates for most of the positions of the APC national working committee (NWC).\n\nBut with the emergence of two federal lawmakers \u2014 Abdullahi Adamu as national chairman and Abubakar Kyari as deputy national chairman (north) \u2014 there are questions on if they can retain their positions in the national assembly.\n\nAdamu has been representing Nasarawa west senatorial district since 2011, while Kyari has been in the senate since 2015 when he was first elected to represent Borno north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe call for their resignation, echoed by Olisa Agbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), is premised on the Jegede Vs INEC & 3 ors case, where the supreme court held in a minority judgment that the election of Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo state governor, would have been invalidated if Mai Mala Buni, then APC interim chairman, was joined as a party in the suit.\n\nThe minority judgment of the apex court held that Buni was an elected official \u2014 as governor of Yobe state \u2014 and not supposed to have held the position of APC caretaker committee chairman as stipulated in section 183 of the 1999 constitution.\n\nHOW CAN A SENATOR LOSE HIS/HER SEAT?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSection 68 of the constitution provides the grounds upon which a senator can lose his/her seat, which includes \u2014 if he/she becomes a member of another legislative house, defects from the party that sponsored his/her election, or ceases to be Nigerian.\n\nOther conditions include if the lawmaker becomes president, vice-president, governor, deputy governor, minister, commissioner, special adviser or if he/she is recalled.\n\nAlso, one will lose the senate seat if the person \u201cbecomes a member of a commission or other body established by this Constitution or by any other law\u201d or is absent from meetings of the house without just cause \u201cfor a period amounting to the aggregate to more than one-third of the total number of days during which the house meets in any one year\u201d.\n\n\u2018SECTION 183 DOES NOT APPLY TO NWC MEMBERS\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdeola Adedipe, a lawyer, said section 183 of the constitution does not apply to APC NWC members.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that every case must be decided on its merit and peculiar facts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSection 183 of the constitution is a prohibitive section, exclusive in application to a governor. This cannot by parity or reasoning be applicable to a serving senator. This operates by the principle that the express mention of a thing excludes others.\u201d\n\nAdedipe said the provision of section 68(1)(e) which prohibits a senator from being a member of any commission or body established by the constitution or any other law does not apply to the NWC of political parties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is correct that the political party which Senator Adamu belongs is registered with INEC, pursuant to section 222 of the constitution. Inferentially, the political party is registered in alignment with both a legislative enactment and the constitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe supreme court was right in its reasoning on (Jegede v INEC) 14 NWLR (Pt. 1497) 409 at 558 \u2013 559 per Agim JSC, that it is the manifesto of the party that an occupier thereof projects and executes \u2014 meaning that the political party is not considered as an external body or commission or company, which can be affected by the prohibitive section of membership.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdedipe said the issue of conflicting interests cannot arise because the senators are occupying positions in the party through which they were elected as legislators.\n\n\u2018THEY WILL BE SACKED IF CHALLENGED IN COURT\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresenting a contrary opinion, Daniel Bwala, a lawyer and member of the APC, said Adamu and Kyari \u201ccannot keep sitting as serving senators and at the same time run the affairs of the party\u201d.\n\nHe said the word \u201cexecutive\u201d used in Article 17(iv) of the APC constitution and section 183 of the constitution \u201crefers to a position you come to by virtue of a democratically conducted election \u2014 like in this case of our convention\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the national chairman was duly elected. Even though it was a consensus, the consensus is part of the process for electing the national leaders recognised by the party\u2019s constitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, they are now occupying the position of a democratically elected service and cannot, while they hold that position, continue to serve as senators.\u201d\n\nBwala added that although critics can put forward the argument that the national assembly is a legislative position and not executive as stated in the constitution, \u201cit is important to look at the spirit of the law and the intendment of the lawmakers when the constitution was made\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe intendment and contemplation of law is that you cannot be a national chairman and hold any other position from the three arms of government \u2013executive, legislature and judiciary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat means you cannot be a governor and a national chairman, a judge and national chairman or a lawmaker and national chairman.\u201d\n\nHe said if anyone goes to court with that argument, the national chairman will be sacked.\n\n\u201cThe law is talking about non-interference, transparency, fairness and equality. There is no way you can occupy the position of an NWC and you are running for a post that will require the endorsement of NWC that you will be fair to your competitors,\u201d he added.\n\nTHEY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING, SAYS APC\n\nWhen contacted for the party\u2019s position, Felix Morka, APC national publicity secretary, said Adamu and Kyari will \u201cdo the right thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that Mr Chairman is well-advised and has excellent counsel,\u201d Morka said.\n\n\u201cI am confident that he will be doing right by the law as appropriate.\n\n\u201cHe is committed to not just driving the party to greater success, but to do so following due process. So, I\u2019m sure he will do the right thing as to what is expected of him.\n\n\u201cMr chairman is committed to complying with every requirement of law with respect to his office and functions as national chairman of the party.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Alexandria, Egypt\u2019s famous port city, you can drop into any corner store to pick up eggs for an evening meal. Shoppers line up at Spinneys, one of Egypt\u2019s oldest grocery store chains, or any of the other popular hypermarkets to buy the week\u2019s groceries. And oud voices haggling over the price of exotic fish in Al Mansheya\u2019s alley markets is not uncommon.\n\nIt is the only way most people know to shop. Carrefour\u2019s\u2014a popular shopping mall in the City Centre\u2014still gets large crowds during peak hours, and the Souq Al Barsim near Alexandria Corniche is still a bustling open market any day. But more than a few Egyptian grocery shoppers are adopting a new buying behaviour\u2014tapping their smartphones to order everything they need to make the next meal, from cereals to fresh food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge market, and it\u2019s highly fragmented and multi-layered,\u201d Shehab Mokhtar tells TechCabal.\n\nMokhtar is the founder and CEO of Appetito, an on-demand grocery retail business that delivers groceries to users from a small network of dark stores in Cairo. The press statement announcing its $2M pre-Series raise says Appetito now delivers 2,000 items from 12 fulfilment centres every day.\n\nUnlike most popular on-demand startups in the grocery business, Appetito doesn\u2019t promise quick deliveries. Instead, Mokhtar says Appetito offers 60-minute or even weekly scheduled deliveries and an opportunity to save on prices. This \u201cquick-commerce\u201d startup is betting that slow is good business and Egyptians won\u2019t mind waiting for an hour for next week\u2019s groceries to reach their doorsteps. Like Getir, its Turkish peer in the quick-commerce business, the Egyptian on-demand grocery startup wants to be as close as possible to its Egyptian customers.\n\nHow? By creating a network of micro-fulfilment centres located minutes away from the homes of Appetito users.\n\nThe Getir framework for last-mile distribution.\n\nOnly the red-painted motorcycles that zip in and out of the quiet neighbourhood betray the true nature of the small building where a gloved picker emerges once every few minutes to hand a waiting rider branded packages. This is one of Appetito\u2019s dark stores in a Cairo suburb. By the end of this year, Mokhtar says Appetito will have expanded its dark store network to 3 cities\u2014Cairo, Giza, and Alexandria. The company plans to add 50 more dark stores every year until 2024.\n\n\u201cDark stores\u201d are shops that don\u2019t sell directly to customers. Instead, they are micro-fulfilment centres for orders that have come through digital platforms. Because customers don\u2019t have to enter the shops, dark stores have more space to store inventory and quickly and accurately fulfil orders.\n\nInside any of Appetito\u2019s 12 dark stores, pickers browse a list of items from an online order and move around the tiny aisles collecting the items and packing them. FMCG suppliers like Unilever, Henkel, Procter & Gamble, and Kellogg\u2019s deliver items in bulk to these mini-warehouses. In contrast, perishable food items are shipped directly or stored in better-equipped facilities.\n\nAppetito does not own these mini-warehouses. It operates a franchise system where local partners provide some of the capital and manage in-store operations. Appetito only helps with hiring and stocking the stores and its proprietary inventory management software.\n\nIn addition to sourcing its products directly from leading FMCG manufacturers, Appetito also sells its private label products and collects a fee for advertising suppliers\u2019 products on its app.\n\nMokhtar says his goal is to build Egypt\u2019s operation and technology infrastructure to connect brands with customers and provide \u201ca convenient and affordable experience\u201d with flexible payment options. If everything goes according to plan, the shoppers who do their grocery shopping in one of Alexandria\u2019s many street markets will have one more option for weekly restocking\u2014their smartphones.\n\nStephen Deng, Partner at DFS Lab says his venture capital firm are, \u201cbig believers that dark stores represent a shift in last-mile retail that\u2019s here to stay.\u201d\n\nBut dark stores are not chugging away unchallenged.\n\nIn Europe, for example, their pandemic-spurred growth has attracted the ire of city governments. Some of them have even called them a \u201cblight\u201d, which is ironic since the very restrictions these governments enforced enabled dark stores to thrive. But these regulatory setbacks offer startups like Appetito a glimpse of what to expect when 150 dark stores begin delivering store-keeping units (SKUs) numbering hundreds of thousands a day.\n\nBut regulatory hurdles are just one of many challenges they will face.\n\nThe last-mile question\n\nDigital commerce entrepreneurs often say they are solving \u201cfragmented\u201d buying and selling. That is partly true. When you shop for groceries through Appetito\u2019s app, you don\u2019t have to visit multiple stores yourself.\n\nBut there is a different perspective. One that looks at the story of digital commerce as an ongoing attempt to aggregate the act of buying while simultaneously separating the act of buying to an online frontend for ordering and paying for goods, inventory management software and the dozens of motorcycles zipping through traffic to deliver orders.\n\nIn other words, digital commerce, especially the quick-commerce variety, is fragmentation on motorcycles.\n\nAs pandemic restrictions fade, however, the question at the heart of dark-store powered quick-commerce is changing.\n\n\n\nWith home deliveries returning to being a convenience instead of a necessity and a brewing economic downturn, the emerging question is, what do customers want? Groceries and home cleaning supplies delivered in 15 minutes? Or groceries bought at the lowest prices?\n\nThe best aggregators will win as a population grappling with rising inflation post-COVID interventions tests on-demand grocery startups. One recurring request on Appetito\u2019s Facebook page is for discount codes for the day.\n\nIf we can draw on lessons from previous economic downturns in the region, how much \u201caggregation\u201d will save for the consumer will play a more vital role than how fast the order is delivered. Even Getir is opening its dark stores for nearby shoppers to pick up their orders. In Egypt, offline retail shops are just around the corner.\n\nMokhtar seems to understand this. He told TechCrunch in an earlier interview, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to mix between affordability and convenience. If we\u2019re going to go only for the convenience, which is 10 or 15 minutes, that\u2019s going to be at the expense of affordability,\u201d Mokhtar said. \u201cAnd this is something we do not seek or even try to scale in Egypt or the countries that we are trying to penetrate going forward.\u201d\n\nIf digital commerce is a bet that convenience generates orders, Uber-for-groceries startups will need to show how dark store franchises make the business maths work. Appetito is the leading case study candidate for this in Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "During a chat at the company\u2019s head office in Yaba, a suburb on Lagos Mainland once touted as Nigeria\u2019s Silicon Valley, CEO Tayo Oviosu recalls the epiphany moment that led to the founding of Paga back in April 2009.\n\nThe Stanford-educated Oviosu had just returned to the country he was born and raised in but left at age 16 and wanted to venture into the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nOpportunities in the private sector at the time were immense. Nigeria\u2019s central bank was pushing for a cashless economy but banks were slow to innovate. After considering several ideas for a couple of months, Oviosu came up with what is now Paga.\n\n\u201cBack then, a lot of transactions in Nigeria were largely cash-dependent which was inefficient for both businesses and individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cPaga was born out of my own frustration with carrying cash around. The idea was simple\u2014there had to be a way to make payments simpler.\u201d\n\nOviosu, aiming to build the \u201cPaypal for Africa\u201d, then teamed up with Jay Alabraba to launch a mobile payments company named Paga, a Spanish word that means \u201cto pay\u201d.\n\nPaga was arguably the first fintech company in Nigeria to popularise mobile money among the unbanked. At the time it was launched, the main players bridging payments with mobile technology in Nigeria were Interswitch, eTranzact, and SystemSpec\u2019s Remita.\n\nThirteen years on, Paga\u2014now a UK-headquartered Group\u2014has amassed more than 19 million unique users through its consumer channel and agent network of over 120,000 agents across Nigeria. Since the company began commercial operations in 2012, it\u2019s processed over $10 billion ( \u20a64 trillion).\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Oviosu reflects on Paga\u2019s evolution and growth and talks about product innovation, global expansion, and the next phase for both Paga and the fintech landscape in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDigitising consumer payments\n\nOviosu\u2019s goal for Paga was to build a platform that simplified payments, digitised cash transactions, and delivered financial services to the mass market. He started with a team of 8, a figure that\u2019s grown to more than 100.\n\nPaga\u2019s initial set of products was focused on providing more people access to traditional banking services \u2013 especially sending and receiving money \u2013 through mobile phones and physical agents equipped with POS devices. At an agent outlet, customers show up without an account number and for a fee, are able to send and receive money to anyone.\n\nIn December 2019, after the introduction of national identity numbers (NIN) and bank verification numbers (BVN), Paga launched its consumer direct product that allowed users to create mobile accounts and used wallets for transactions through the mobile app and USSD.\n\nAccording to Oviosu, more than 3.7 million wallets have been created on Paga since then while the company plans to roll out physical and virtual cards later this year.\n\nA chart showing growth in Paga\u2019s TPV since its founded. Image credit: Paga.\n\nOver the years, Paga\u2019s total processed value (TPV) has grown exponentially. While it took the company 99 months to get to its first \u20a62 trillion, Oviosu revealed it took 22 months to reach the next \u20a62 trillion.\n\nIn 2021, Paga crossed the \u20a61 trillion mark in annual TPV for the first time\u2014hitting \u20a61.2 trillion\u2014and is on track to reach \u20a62 trillion this year alone, according to the CEO.\n\nAs part of its consumer payments play, Paga in February announced its addition as a payment provider for Twitter Tips, a feature that enables Twitter users to either send or receive by simply linking their preferred third-party payment service providers to their profiles.\n\nBeyond consumer payments, however, Paga is now a fintech behemoth helping merchants digitise payments (under a separate brand called Doroki) and opening up its infrastructure for third-party companies to easily offer financial services.\n\nPaga Group is a teenager today! What started out as a simple idea to make it simple to pay & get paid is now 3 business lines:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Consumer Payments \u2013 @paga\n\n\u2013 Embedded Finance \u2013 Paga PaaS https://t.co/AvGdBzElZ5\n\n\u2013 Seller/Merchant \u2013 @doroki_ng\n\n\n\nThanks to our amazing team \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/yC5Gv64kGm \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) April 3, 2022\n\nDoroki for merchants\n\nLast year, Paga launched Doroki, a separate unit within the Group that leverages Paga\u2019s payment infrastructure to help SMEs digitise payments.\n\nDoroki allows merchants to accept cards and other forms of digital payments via point-of-sale (POS) terminals and mobile POS handheld devices, making it easy for them to get paid and track inventory while enabling them to provide other value-added financial services to customers.\n\nWhile Covid-19 has increased the use of technology in payments and money transfers in Africa, the purchase and onboarding cost of POS devices is unaffordable for most merchants.\n\nPaga announced last year a partnership with Untapped Global to provide financing that would lower the cost of entry for merchants, with payments recovered from the revenues earned on the devices.\n\nAfter a successful pilot programme, which saw 2,000 businesses provided with financed POS devices, Oviosu revealed that more than 6,000 sellers currently now use Doroki to collect payments in the wake of the commercial launch last November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build an ecosystem for the consumer to conveniently make payments and for SMEs to manage their businesses and do payrolls,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nProduct infrastructure play\n\nFrom merely enabling Nigerians (individuals and businesses) to make and receive payments with ease, the Paga group now offers open-source APIs to companies for building products.\n\nPaga\u2019s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business started with the acquisition of a remittance license in 2018, after which it allowed companies like Western Union and Wise to terminate remittances to accounts in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, Paga opened up its platform to more businesses through Collect APIs, which more than 200 businesses currently use.\n\nPaga\u2019s open wallet is available to any third-party developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compete with you building your wealth management app; we\u2019ll help you,\u201d the CEO said, adding that its recent integration with Flutterwave is built around the same APIs.\n\nThis wknd I experienced the power of Paga's Connect API \u2013 one-click payments \u2013 on @theflutterwave as I paid for my day 2 return covid test \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nI had previously linked my Paga acct to Flutterwave so going fwd it's super easy to pay on any website using Flutterwave!@TechProd_Arch pic.twitter.com/6WJkFOvAWa \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) January 24, 2022\n\nIn effect, Paga has extended beyond the payments business to becoming a product infrastructure company, which entails entering into partnerships with tech companies in similar and adjacent sectors.\n\nPaga\u2019s Nigeria approach\n\nPaga\u2019s go-to-market strategy in Nigeria has been a hybrid approach that combines offline and online channels. \u201cA majority of the population may not be tech-savvy and smartphone penetration is still low,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nStarting out, Paga relied on a retail network of shops and agents that consumers can visit for in-person transactions. \u201cTo scale in Africa, you need a hybrid (digital and physical) approach. If you don\u2019t want or know how to use the technology, you can go to agents and still deal in [physical] cash, but the agent can do the digital.\u201d\n\nOviosu acknowledges that in Nigeria, physical cash is very much still a thing and won\u2019t go away anytime soon. Smartphone penetration has also not improved significantly. Hence, the company \u201cstill needs on ramps & off ramps to cash\u201d.\n\nAlthough the share of Paga\u2019s total transactions being done via agents has declined in recent years.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, agents accounted for about 90% of our transactions. Last year, that figure fell to 60%, an indication that other channels/parts of the business are growing fast.\u201d\n\nA Paga paypoint in Lagos. Image credit: Tayo Oviosu/Twitter.\n\nWhat next for Paga? Expansion\n\n\u201cThe vision is still the same\u2014to solve payments for individuals and businesses,\u201d Oviosu said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken an open approach. It\u2019s not a closed circle.\u201d\n\nOn what an \u201copen approach\u201d means, the CEO explained that with Paga, users can link their several bank accounts, debit cards, and mobile money wallets from other providers.\n\nIn addition, anybody\u2014including non-Paga account holders\u2014can pay a Doroki merchant. \u201cYou can walk into a store and pay with your card, scan a QR code, or make payments using USSD from any bank.\u201d\n\nWhile the vision has been steady, the ambition and scope of Paga have grown over time.\n\nAlongside product expansion, Paga has in its sight a global expansion starting with Ethiopia. In January 2020, it acquired Apposit, an Ethiopian software development company that is planned to be its vehicle for entry into East Africa and Latin America. Last month, Paga announced an official launch in the Horn of Africa country.\n\nBecause there are local nuances to be aware of, Paga has a local team of at least 50 in Ethiopia. The payments platform was also built to be multilingual, so switching from one language to another is easy.\n\nAs per funding the expansion plans, Oviosu revealed Paga, which has secured $35 million to date\u2014with the backing of investors such as Jim O\u2019Neill and Tim Draper\u2014is looking to raise additional capital.\n\nTayo Oviosu, Paga co-founder and CEO.\n\nFintech innovation in Africa\n\nOn the next phase of innovation in Africa\u2019s fintech space, Oviosu expects new startups to build more solutions on existing infrastructure provided by older players like Paga, Flutterwave, Paystack, etc. to solve key problems.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years of Paga was building infrastructure where it didn\u2019t exist. We built a hybrid payment infrastructure for the online and offline customer,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cNew companies don\u2019t need to repeat that. I expect to see more of them focusing on niche markets that can scale, leveraging existing platforms through open-source APIs.\u201d\n\nAs for Paga, the vision remains the same: getting up to one billion people using its platform to access and use money, according to Oviosu.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

This is faster than the average for all occupations. The median wage is also higher than that of other jobs.\n\nBut what\u2019s the outlook for tech workers in Africa? To answer that question, we\u2019re conducting a survey to ascertain tech workers\u2019 salaries in Africa and will appreciate your help.\n\nPlease fill out this form if you work in any tech role.

L-R. Caroline van der Merwe and Simon Ellis\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech sector has attracted the most funding in the last three years, receiving $2.3 billion in 2021 alone. Some sectors get less than $50 million, cementing fintech\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis year seems to have seen increased attention on startups focused on digitising human resources and payroll functions for African businesses. Companies like Khazna, which provides salary-on-demand for employees, Earnipay, and SeamlessHR have all received investments this year.\n\nYesterday, another startup, SmartWage, announced its $2 million seed funding. The company received investment from Idris Bello, founding partner of LoftyInc Capital, Creator Collective Capital, Penrose Capital, and angel investors from Naspers, Dimension Data, Investec, and Standard Bank.\n\nWhat does SmartWage do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup enables employers to manage HR functions for employees who do not have an email via WhatsApp. This includes communication, leave requests, accessing payslips, and other products the company offers.\n\nIts solution is primarily focused on frontline employees like security personnel, restaurant staff, and cashiers who often do not have an email. Since it was founded in 2020, SmartWage has added clients like Debonairs, Seattle Coffee, Truda, Twizza, KFC, and Edgars.\n\nIn a statement on the investment, Bello shared his optimism that the startup could drive digital inclusion in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe team at SmartWage are innovators \u2013 they\u2019re building more than just an earned wage access product, and have recognised that in order to make a tangible impact on employers, they need to build a powerful way for employers to engage with their workforce.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Simon, Caroline and the powerful team they\u2019ve assembled to support SmartWage\u2019s mission to drive digital inclusion across Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nZirooPay\u2019s Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional PoS Terminal\n\nThe popularity of PoS merchants in Nigeria has grown in the last five years as more individuals choose them over long ATM and bank queues. Before this, a customer who intended to withdraw or make deposits had to wait for some time before completing transactions.\n\nThe financial institutions powering these merchants (banks and fintechs) have also seen tremendous growth. One of these fintech startups \u2013 ZirooPay \u2013 has announced the completion of its $11.4 million Series A round.\n\nThe round had a combination of institutional and individual investors, such as Zrosk Investment Management, Inventure, Fedha Capital, Exotix Advisory, Petri Kivinen, Abiodun Ajai, Kurt Bjorklund, Stephane Kurgan, and Jonas Dromberg.\n\nThe startup plans to use these new funds to expand its payment infrastructure, accelerate growth, and grow its team.\n\nThe company\u2019s value proposition is to improve the transaction success rate of merchants on its platform. It does this using an application that can work in areas with little or no Internet coverage.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nWhile PoS services target areas with low bank penetration, the PoS machines are powered by the Internet. Consequently, they often experience downtimes as a result of poor Internet connections. However, with ZirooPay\u2019s solution, the company claims it can ensure transaction success rates of 95% compared to 50% from competing services.\n\nDevCareer\u2019s $100k grant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nDevCareer has received a $100,000 grant for the third cohort of its Laptops4Developers program. The non-profit revealed that it plans to train 100 people in this cohort which will run in five African countries \u2013 Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, and Rwanda.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem grows, the demand for African tech talents has grown simultaneously. This demand has been partly driven by remote work and some African countries having English as an official language.\n\nSeveral businesses have sprung up to fill this demand for talent with the likes of Gebeya, Andela, and TalentQL (where DevCareer\u2019s founder, Sultan Akintunde is a co-founder). However, DevCareer is different from the others as it is a non-profit organization.\n\nAkintunde started DevCareer with another software engineer, Chidi Okoye, in 2019. Before that, he had tried to raise funds for people looking to get into tech. A conversation with a sponsor led to the start of DevCareer to provide a pathway to help upcoming African developers.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nCan Nigeria tax its remote workers?\n\nHow I Grew to 1M YouTube Subscribers in Medical School \u2013 Kharma Medic\n\nRide-Hailing: Is It Sustainable?\n\nOpportunities\n\nBitmama has several roles open.

          "text": "A growing number of bank customers in Nigeria have voiced concerns over what they described as excessive charges on their transactions, threatening the country\u2019s financial inclusion drive.\n\nTop Nigerian banks recorded an increase in fees and commission income last year, a BusinessDay analysis of their 2021 financial statements show.\n\nMany customers have reached out to some banks on Twitter to complain of \u201coutrageous\u201d charges deducted from their various accounts.\n\n\u201cI will liken the various deductions in every transaction done with our banks as multiple tragedies on Nigerians trying to survive this ugly economic situation,\u201d a bank customer told BusinessDay.\n\nWhile sharing his experience, he described two of the tier 1 banks as the most unfriendly bankers in the country.\n\n\u201cLate February, I had to close my current account due to the unnecessary deductions; even the bank\u2019s staff could not explain,\u201d the customer said.\n\n\u201cI discovered that after a transaction, I was charged \u2018transfer commission\u2019 of N20.00; I was also charged telco plus VAT N7.5 and USSD telco session charge, all in one transaction,\u201d another customer, who lives in Ikorodu, said.\n\nA middle-aged woman who lives in Festac, Lagos showed BusinessDay how she was charged N9.98 and N133.03 on April 1, 2022, without any indication of what the charges were for.\n\n\u201cThe excessive charges will slow down the rate of financial inclusion as customers will avoid operating a bank account. It\u2019s been established by several surveys that customers are very sensitive to charges,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, an investment professional, said.\n\nHe said low transaction charges would be a major selling point for banks in the short to medium term as customers would migrate to banks with the least charges.\n\nIn a joint statement issued on March 16, 2021 by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigerian Communications Commission, financial service providers were directed to charge N6.98 per transaction for USSD services.\n\nAnother customer complained on Twitter that a bank had been charging him for SMS alerts for over six years, even though he did not subscribe for the service.\n\n\u201cI have complained to the point that I am tired. I did not subscribe to SMS alerts and I don\u2019t receive any SMS alerts whatsoever but still get charged for it anyways,\u201d he said.\n\nThe financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 of some of the banks, especially the systemic important banks, showed an increase in their non-interest income.\n\nRead also: CBN warns banks against \u2018composed\u2019 banknotes\n\nNon-interest income is the revenue or income that banks and financial institutions earn from non-core activities that play a significant role in their overall profitability. It includes loan processing fee, late payment fees, credit card charges, service charges, and penalties, among others.\n\nGuaranty Trust Holding Company Plc saw its non-interest income, comprising fees and commission income, net trading gains, and other income, rise by 17.1 percent to N180.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, according to its annual report.\n\nThe bank explained that the non-interest income growth resulted largely from 39.4 percent growth in fees and commission income, 9.9 percent increase in other income, which was partly offset by 8.6 percent decrease in net trading gains.\n\nAccess Bank recorded a net fee and commission income of N118.59 billion in 2021, rising by 26.73 from N93.57 billion in 2020.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s non-interest income increased by 23 percent from N251.7 billion in 2020 to N309 billion in 2021.\n\nFBN Holdings, the holding company for First Bank of Nigeria, saw its fees and commission income increase by 18.47 percent to N103.77 billion in nine months of 2021 from N87.59 billion in the same period of 2020.\n\nThe net fees and commission income of United Bank for Africa rose to N158.64 billion in 2021 from N126.94 billion in 2020, according to its annual report.\n\nWhen a customer transfers below N5,000, a bank is expected to charge N10; N5,001 -N50,000 attract a charge of N25, and above N50,000 attracts N50 as electronic fund transfer charge, according to the CBN.\n\nBut some banks are charging higher than what is stipulated by the CBN. BusinessDay gathered that one of the tier two banks charges N26.88 for fund transfers of between N10,000 and N50,000, and N53.75 for transfers above N50,000.\n\n\u201cTo worsen it, these deductions are taken from both the sender and receiver. The CBN should also tell Nigerians who is supposed to pay the charge of any transfer \u2013 is it the sender or receiver? But our banks and telcos are currently taking it from both sides,\u201d a customer said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe problem here is that the regulator may not be aware of these deductions, as the bankers claim. Also, the government programme on financial inclusion is being gradually suffocated by these multiple deductions, especially now that the banks have no interest to add to any savings. And the issue of mobile banking is also being seriously threatened.\n\n\u201cThe CBN should come in at this time to curb these deductions in order to bring sanity to our banking sector.\u201d",

It includes loan processing fee, late payment fees, credit card charges, service charges, and penalties, among others.\n\nGuaranty Trust Holding Company Plc saw its non-interest income, comprising fees and commission income, net trading gains, and other income, rise by 17.1 percent to N180.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, according to its annual report.\n\nThe bank explained that the non-interest income growth resulted largely from 39.4 percent growth in fees and commission income, 9.9 percent increase in other income, which was partly offset by 8.6 percent decrease in net trading gains.\n\nAccess Bank recorded a net fee and commission income of N118.59 billion in 2021, rising by 26.73 from N93.57 billion in 2020.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s non-interest income increased by 23 percent from N251.7 billion in 2020 to N309 billion in 2021.\n\nFBN Holdings, the holding company for First Bank of Nigeria, saw its fees and commission income increase by 18.47 percent to N103.77 billion in nine months of 2021 from N87.59 billion in the same period of 2020.\n\nThe net fees and commission income of United Bank for Africa rose to N158.64 billion in 2021 from N126.94 billion in 2020, according to its annual report.\n\nWhen a customer transfers below N5,000, a bank is expected to charge N10; N5,001 -N50,000 attract a charge of N25, and above N50,000 attracts N50 as electronic fund transfer charge, according to the CBN.\n\nBut some banks are charging higher than what is stipulated by the CBN. BusinessDay gathered that one of the tier two banks charges N26.88 for fund transfers of between N10,000 and N50,000, and N53.75 for transfers above N50,000.\n\n\u201cTo worsen it, these deductions are taken from both the sender and receiver. The CBN should also tell Nigerians who is supposed to pay the charge of any transfer \u2013 is it the sender or receiver? But our banks and telcos are currently taking it from both sides,\u201d a customer said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe problem here is that the regulator may not be aware of these deductions, as the bankers claim. Also, the government programme on financial inclusion is being gradually suffocated by these multiple deductions, especially now that the banks have no interest to add to any savings. And the issue of mobile banking is also being seriously threatened.\n\n\u201cThe CBN should come in at this time to curb these deductions in order to bring sanity to our banking sector.\u201d",

Chike John Okafor.\n\nThe speaker, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, presided over the plenary yesterday in Abuja.\n\nThe motion reads, \u201cThe House notes that the Nigeria Mainstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) was created in August 2021 in line with the Petroleum Industry Act with the mandate to provide effective regulatory oversight, ensure sufficient product distribution and supply at an equitable and fair price.\n\n\u201cAlso notes that almost all businesses and households in Nigeria depend on diesel-powered generators as an alternative source of electricity.\n\n\u201cFurther notes the outrageous rise in the price of Automotive Gas Oil (Diesel) as the product which was sold between N280 to N350 per litre three (3) weeks ago is currently being sold above N780 per litre and still rising on a daily basis accounting for over 115.4 per cent increase within three weeks.\n\n\u201cConcerned that diesel was deregulated in 2009 with an initial price of 100 Naira per litre, and between 2009 till date, Nigerians have witnessed a rising percentage increase in the price of the product;\n\n\u201cAlso concerned that the hike in the cost of diesel is alleged to be the handiwork of unscrupulous stakeholders in the industry, and is tantamount to economic sabotage, causing untold hardships for Nigerians as it will result in an increase in prices of food as well as other goods and services.\n\n\u201cWorried that the possible inflationary pressure envisaged from the rise in the cost of diesel could reduce consumers\u2019 disposable income, thus making it impossible for average Nigerians to meet their basic needs.\n\n\u201cCognisant that if the ugly trend of the increasing price of diesel is not checked, the multiplier effect will spell doom for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u201d",

Chille Igbawua 2023 Benue Governorship Consultative Team has described as malicious, mischievous and unfortunate, the statement credited to the acting national publicity secretary of the Youth wing of Kwande United Peoples Organisation (KWAPO), Hon. Akoso W. Iorfater, to the effect that Igbawua may have endorsed the zoning of the 2023 Benue governorship slot to Jechira intermidiate bloc instead of Kwande.\n\nThe Team believes that the fabricators of the mischief deliberately misinformed the KWUPO Youth Wing in order to accomplish a dishonourable objective.\n\nA statement signed by Hon. Salem Atsehe of the Hon. Barr. Chille Igbawua Benue 2023 Consultative Team, also stated that Hon. Igbawua, being \u201ca patriotic and proud son of Kwande has advocated most forcefully at every opportunity that, in the spirit of fairness, justice and equity, the Kwande intermidiate area should produce the next governor of the state come 2023 for obvious reasons that the exalted office has rotated and completed the circle, and it will be only just and proper to begin from Kwande where it started in 1979.\n\n\u201cThat both on the principle of two equal equities as well as the doctrine of recency, Kwande is favoured.\u201d\n\nThe statement further disclosed that at an earlier meeting with G14 on the issue of zoning, all the governorship aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from Kwande and Jechira had undertook to accept the zoning to either Kwande or Jechira, adding that the 20-man Kwande Elders, who canvassed for the zoning of the governorship seat to Kwande also accepted the arrangement at the same meeting.\n\nThe campaign team noted that after the result of the zoning committee set up by the leadership of the PDP in the state was announced, Hon. Igbawua was invited to respond on behalf of his colleague-aspirants as the Forum of Aspirants chairman and not in his personal capacity nor on behalf of Kwande Intermediate Area.\n\n\u201cAnywhere Hon. Barr. Chille Igbawua speaks on behalf of all PDP Governorship aspirants, he does so as chairman. He merely conveys the opinion of his colleague-aspirants as forum chairman and on that day, it was the same scenario without any resenting voice.\n\n\u201cTherefore, singling out the aspirant as having endorsed zoning of the governorship to Jechira, while other aspirants from Kwande as well as party leaders and stakeholders of Kwande extraction present raised no objection is most uncharitable to say the least,\u201d Atsehe said.\n\nHe added that, \u201cKWUPO Youth Wing having raised objection, which is proper in a democracy, must insulate self from misinformation by mischief makers.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note that, Barr. Chile Igbawua believes that the process of selection of candidates for election by the PDP for the 2023 general elections just got started and the option of consensus is only being explored. All pertinent suggestions/ objections raised at this point are lawful and will help the process. It is too early in the day to be despondent.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Kwande still has opportunity of appeal it must be done in the spirit of intral-party conflict resolution rather than resort to name calling at this stage.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Hon. Barr Chille Igbawua is in the race to win but also is obliged to exercise the responsibility of his office of state chairman PDP 2023 Governorship Aspirants Forum,\u201d Atsehe stated.",

          "text": "Chairman Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) Professor Bolaji Owasanoye (SAN) Tuesday said indiscriminate recruitments into the Federal Civil Service by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) is responsible for high personnel cost in the nation\u2019s budget.\n\nThe situation, he said, was made worse with the associated problem of fake certificates in the civil service.\n\n\u201cIndiscriminate recruitment has impacted the personnel budget such that the personnel wage bill has continued to rise geometrically almost doubling between 2015 and 2022 from N1.832trn in 2015 to N3.494trn in 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Owasanoye stated this in Abuja at the National Policy Dialogue, organised by ICPC through its Anti-Corruption Academy of Nigeria (ACAN).\n\nAccording to him, the ICPC had received and was investigating almost 100 petitions on recruitment scam from victims\u2019 institutions and complicit individuals, adding that the situation continues to fester due to lack of transparency in recruitment process.\n\nHe said there is a lack of transparency in the public service recruitment process across all tiers of government in the country irrespective of political party in power.\n\nThe ICPC boss said the policy dialogue was meant to deliberate on issues that focused on more systemic and institutional improvements, which also should be sustainable regardless of changes in political administrations.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this Policy Dialogue on Entrenching Transparency in Public Service Recruitment Process in Nigeria could not have come at a better time than now. This is because there is near consensus across our country and across all political divides that there is a lack of transparency in the public service recruitment process across all tiers of government in our country. This is regardless of which political party holds the reign of power in these three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cLack of transparency in the recruitment process has been subject of discussions not only in the various mass media organs but also very vociferously in the legislative arms of government across levels. Some members of the executive arm of government have equally voiced their concerns on the matter.\n\n\u201cIn actual fact, many Nigerians in both official and non-official quarters have expressed serious concerns over the growing patronage system in the public sector. For example, the Executive Governor of Borno state His Excellency Professor Babagana Zulum raised a serious concern that these days the recruitment into the Security Agencies (Nigerian Army, Police and others) has been politicized.\n\n\u201cAnd according to him, the governors, ministers and other top government functionaries have recruitment slots who are not interviewed whether they are qualified or not. It does appear to us that the meritocratic tradition in the public service which existed to some degree up to the 80s in our country is gradually disappearing with very few islands of recruitment integrity only remaining.\u201d\n\nHoS also laments\n\nIn her remarks, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HoS) Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, also lamented the lack of transparency in recruitment into the nation\u2019s civil service.\n\nShe, however, said the current administration, through the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, had taken decisive steps to nip in the bud the alarming sharp practices and acts of impunity being perpetrated on the IPPIS, as well as to purge the system of all infiltrations.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening to point out that the office recently received a report from the Federal Civil Service Commission forwarding the names of over 500 persons in various MDAs in possession of fake letters of appointment and which are to be delisted from the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS) Platform.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, following the outcome of the Service-Wide Verification Exercise for officers recruited from 2013 \u2013 2020, the Federal Civil Service Commission has also requested the suspension of the salaries of over 3,000 officers across the MDAs who failed to appear for the exercise pending further clearance\u2026\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that in March last year, the Office informed of the detection of fake letters of employment presented in some Ministries. For instance, in the past year, in one Ministry alone, over 1,000 individuals bearing fake letters of appointment were detected.\u201d\n\nLamenting how endemic corruption into public service had become, she quoted a survey by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that said 32 percent of Nigerians gave bribes to enable them secure employment into the public service.\n\n\u201cA report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, averred that 32 percent of Nigerians gave bribes to enable them secure employment into the public service in 2019. What is also important to note from the report, which perhaps is fundamental to understanding how corruption thrives in recruitment processes is that an increasing number of the job seekers were in contact with public officials or possibly other entities. Hence, the trend underscores the importance of putting in place systems to reduce, to the possible minimum, any form of human contact.\u201d\n\nExplaining in practical terms, efforts of the present administration to stop the menace, she said: \u201cYou may be aware that at inception, the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) focused mainly on Payroll in view of Government\u2019s desire to block financial leakages from high personnel cost caused by ghost workers.\n\n\u201cThis, however, created a gap leading to series of implementation issues. As at March 2022, over 390,000 officers are on the IPPIS payroll being 66,000 and 320,000 for core and non-core MDAs respectively. This figure is without prejudice to the military, paramilitary and universities.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the office commenced activities towards the implementation of the Human Resource (HR) Module of IPPIS with a view to bridging some of the identified gaps. Following the successful completion of the verification exercise in the core MDAs, officers who failed to get verified have had their salaries suspended. However, the office is carrying out a mop-up exercise in the core-MDAs for those who were not verified.\n\n\u201cAs part of our control mechanisms, we are presently conducting I.P.P.I.S Human Resource (HR) Verification Exercise for the Employees of Non-Core Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAS) in batches, starting with Abuja after extending our earlier deadline for the closure of the IPPIS HR Verification Portal. The entire exercise which will also cover MDAs in all the Geo-political zones of the country is expected to end with a Mop-up Verification Exercise across the non-core MDAs in September, this year (2022). Thus, this would enable the office derive a verified list of officers on IPPIS.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, said heads of MDAs are most times under pressure from \u2018above\u2019 when it comes to employment into the public service even when the applicants are not qualified for the job.\n\nNarrating a personal experience during the recent recruitment into the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the minister said: \u201cFor the NSCDC, about 1.5 million applications were registered on the website. Those who met the requirements on age and height were about 750,000 and were asked to upload their certificates.\n\n\u201cA total of 217,000 applicants uploaded their certificates of which 113,000 were shortlisted to write the CBT but only 53,116 eventually sat for the test. It is from these that 5,000 were picked among the successful ones.\n\n\u201cIt is a long and tortuous process. It is also a novelty. So we expect a lot of pressure. Some of the pressures are understandable. A woman came with her son after getting very high up people to influence his appointment. But we discovered that the son was far, far below the required height of 1.7 metres. Some applicants on wheelchairs also came, demanding for the statutory five per cent allocation for special people. We politely explained to them that the job is paramilitary, requiring strenuous physical exercise for which they are not eligible, given their physical condition.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Aregbesola called for transparency and digitisation of recruitment process in order to eliminate secret recruitment, adding people would begin to see that the process is honest and transparent while the pressures abate.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn recruiting into the paramilitary agencies of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the board decided to advertise in the media to bring the information to the awareness of as many people as possible. This rules out secret recruitment.\n\n\u201cWe also put away the manual mode of conducting tests to computer based tests that can be done in any location, eliminating the need to have a mass crowd together in one place. We hired a reputable examination body, the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) for the aptitude test.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we included the National Identity Number (NIN) to authenticate the identities and bio data of applicants and eliminate fraud and possible impersonation.\n\n\u201cWe also engaged the Federal Character Commission at all stages of the recruitment exercise. All these were done through a dedicated website.\n\n\u201cBut I must say that Nigerians are reasonable people. Once they see the honest and transparency of our efforts, the pressures begins to abate.\n\n\u201cWe have hope now that the transparency of the exercise will infuse credibility into recruitment and encourage those eminently qualified but cynical that because they don\u2019t have anyone high up to push their case, will now start to have faith and show interest in future exercise.\u201d",
          "summary": "The situation, he said, was made worse with the associated problem of fake certificates in the civil service.\nHe said there is a lack of transparency in the public service recruitment process across all tiers of government in the country irrespective of political party in power.\n\u201cThe timing of this Policy Dialogue on Entrenching Transparency in Public Service Recruitment Process in Nigeria could not have come at a better time than now.\nThis is because there is near consensus across our country and across all political divides that there is a lack of transparency in the public service recruitment process across all tiers of government in our country.\n\u201cWe also engaged the Federal Character Commission at all stages of the recruitment exercise.",

          "text": "Repeated calls by football-loving Nigerians for Amaju Pinnick to resign as President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) seem to have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nThis is as Pinnick convened and presided over NFF executive committee meeting one week after the surprise ouster of Nigeria\u2019s Super Eagles from the 2022 World Cup scheduled for Qatar.\n\nShortly after the disastrous non-qualification from the mundial, Nigerians including sports editors, ex-internationals, pundits among other stakeholders had harmoniously demanded immediate Pinnick\u2019s and other board members\u2019 resignation.\n\nRather, the NFF board went to meet on Tuesday, and subsequently issued a communique.\n\nThe communique reads, \u201cThe Executive Committee tendered unreserved apology to the Federal Government and the people of Nigeria for the inability of the Super Eagles to win a ticket to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. It praised the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR for his personal presence and apologised that the team faltered in the quest for a ticket to Qatar.2) For his steadfastness, exemplary leadership and warm relationship with the NFF since assuming office and especially for the FIFA World Cup playoff matches, the Committee commended, appreciated and applauded the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cThe Committee further commended the Honourable Minister for his savvy in convening the meeting held among the Presidency, Sports Ministry and NFF on Monday, 4th March 2022 to review the unfortunate outcome of the match with Ghana and agree concrete steps on how to reinvigorate the Super Eagles and indeed Nigeria Football going forward. It noted that the meeting was very cordial, as well as established and appreciated the fact that all that was needed to be done and/or provided the team and the technical crew to ensure a positive outcome on the pitch against Ghana was delivered, and in a most professional manner. In addition, unique motivational strategy was put in place to spur the coaches and the players, such as offering the technical crew a two-and-half year contract. The standard agreement NFF had in place with the players that they will share 35% of the qualifying bonus Nigeria will earn by participating at the Qatar 2022 World Cup was also emphasised.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee regretted the death of Dr Joseph Kabungo, appointed as the FIFA Doping Officer for the Nigeria/Ghana FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Playoff match in Abuja on 29th March 2022. It reiterated that Dr Kabungo died as a result of sudden cardiac arrest, as attested to by the autopsy report, and disclosed that his body had been flown to Zambia for final rites accompanied by his family members who were flown to Nigeria two days after the unfortunate incident. It prayed that God grants the soul of Dr Kabungo eternal rest and for fortitude for his family and the Zambia Football Family to bear the big loss. The Committee equally commended the General Secretary for diligence and proficiency in handling issues surrounding the tragic development and also with regards to the match organization.\n\n\u201cAfter exhaustive deliberations, introspection and admission that the outpouring of emotions by fans and stakeholders over the FIFA World Cup miss was legitimate, the Executive Committee urged caution and patience, and assured that in tandem with the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, decisive steps will be taken in the next few days to reposition Nigeria Football in several areas, including the National Teams. It also disclosed that in line with the statutes, roadmap for new elections into the NFF Board will be designed at the Annual General Assembly (AGA) of the NFF once the ex parte injunction suspending the Congress from meeting is vacated. It can be recalled that the AGA to set the roadmap for the next NFF election cycle was statutorily scheduled to hold on 17th December, 2021 in Lagos but an ex parte court order was served on the NFF from a Federal High Court in Bayelsa State to stop the meeting. The NFF had since January 2022 approached the court to vacate the order and the next sitting is scheduled for 26th April 2022. The committee has now proposed June 2022 for the AGA to statutorily set the roadmap for the NFF elective congress provided the order is vacated accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee mandated its Technical and Development Sub-Committee to, within the next 5 days, make recommendations to the Executive Committee on coaching crews for the Super Eagles, the CHAN team, the U20 Boys (Flying Eagles) and the U17 Boys (Golden Eaglets) ahead of upcoming assignments. This is to ensure preparations for the next qualifying tournaments and championships commence in earnest.\n\n\u201cThe Committee hailed the Super Falcons for its qualification for the 12th edition of the Women Africa Cup of Nations taking place in Morocco in the month of July, and promised to provide the team ample support for adequate preparation for the Championship, aware that the event also serves as qualifying tournament for the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup finals. The Super Falcons\u2019 contingent departed Nigeria on Tuesday night for Canada for a two-match tour with that country\u2019s Women\u2019s National Team, and will camp in Morocco for the African Championship.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Committee also commended the U20 Women National Team, Falconets, for its qualification for this year\u2019s FIFA U20 Women\u2019s World Cup taking place in Costa Rica in the month of August, and charged the U17 girls, Flamingos to put in the hard work necessary to win a ticket to this year\u2019s FIFA U17 Women\u2019s World Cup taking place in India in the month of October.",

          "title": "US, EU to Impose More Sanctions on Russia After War-Crimes Reports",
          "text": "The US and the EU are set to unveil new sanctions on Russia this week, after allegations from Ukraine of potential war crimes against civilians by Russian forces galvanized a push for tougher measures against the Kremlin.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, proposed broad new sanctions on Russia, European officials said, including a ban on imports of Russian coal, slashing the access of Russian road and shipping goods carriers into the bloc, targeting oligarchs and their families and blocking some machinery exports.\n\nThe measures will need backing from the bloc\u2019s 27 member states. Meanwhile, the U.S. plans Wednesday to announce a new package of sanctions that would include a ban on all new investment in Russia, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe sanctions will also include additional measures hitting Russian financial institutions and state-owned enterprises, and Russian government officials and their families, the people said.\n\nThe proposed ban on Russian coal, confirmed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, would be the first time the EU has agreed to block imports of one of Russia\u2019s main energy supplies. EU capitals remain divided on whether to impose a ban on Russian oil and gas imports, although the momentum behind introducing a phased-in embargo of Russian oil supplies is gathering.\n\nThe EU proposals also include a complete ban on transactions with several additional Russian banks, three of which have already been removed from the SWIFT financial transactions network, including VTB, Russia\u2019s second biggest lender, the officials said.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration is considering tightening sanctions against Russian financial institutions already subject to measures restricting some of their foreign transactions, the people said. Banks the U.S. is expected to impose sanctions on this week include Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest, and Alfa Bank, one of Russia\u2019s top private lenders. The U.S. is also expected to sanction two daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has already imposed so-called blocking sanctions against VTB and its subsidiaries, which prohibit transactions by U.S. banks and firms and freeze any assets they have within U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nLast week, diplomats indicated many EU member states wanted to focus on consolidating and reinforcing the sanctions measures they had already taken. But the sentiment in capitals shifted rapidly over the weekend. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron joined public calls for a ban on Russian coal and oil imports for the first time.\n\nOfficials are confident most measures can win approval by avoiding the more controversial oil and gas restrictions. German officials have been among those questioning the efficiency of keeping Russian ships out of the bloc\u2014a measure that has already been taken by the U.K.\n\nThe proposed ban on Russian road freight carriers would also affect Belarusian carriers, as well as Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels. There will be exemptions for humanitarian-linked trade such as food and medicine and for energy.\n\nThe EU will also place a quota cap on the import of potash, officials said. The material is used for fertilizer and is widely purchased from Belarus. The sanctions package is also planned to ban a range of other Russian and Belarus imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth \u20ac5.5 billion, equivalent to about $6.5 billion, according to the European Commission.\n\nThe Commission said it would also blacklist dozens of additional Russian oligarchs, politicians and senior officials and will sanction some prominent family members. The current list includes two daughters of Mr. Putin, according to officials. The bloc has already sanctioned the son-in-law of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nMr. Putin doesn\u2019t speak publicly about his family. He has two daughters from a former wife, according to the Kremlin. It isn\u2019t known if Mr. Putin has other children, and it couldn\u2019t be learned if the daughters being targeted in the new EU sanctions were those he has publicly acknowledged. The couple said in 2013 their marriage was over.\n\nThe bloc will also stop the export of some high-tech machinery to Russia, including quantum computers and advanced semiconductors as well as sensitive electrical and transport equipment worth around \u20ac10 billion in annual exports, Ms. von der Leyen said.\n\n\u201cRussia is waging a cruel and ruthless war, not only against Ukraine\u2019s brave troops, but also against its civilian population,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point.\u201d\n\nBut Lithuanian Foreign Minister\n\nGabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU\u2019s proposed sanctions package, calling it a \u201cfeeble response\u201d which is \u201can invitation for more atrocities.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoal, four banks\u2026a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nIf the latest measures are adopted, attention will likely swiftly return to how to reduce oil imports from Russia. Germany has said it could end imports by the end of the year, but there is pressure to move more quickly. For now, the chances of agreeing to a stop to Russian gas imports appear very slim, diplomats said.\n\nMs. von der Leyen said among the ideas that have been proposed by member states is a tax or tariff on Russian oil imports to increase their price and reduce demand. Also floated was the idea of paying Russia only into special escrow accounts, from which Russia wouldn\u2019t be able to easily use the revenue, she said.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain would push North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Group of Seven partners to agree on a timetable for eliminating Russian energy imports.\n\nThat kind of solution could offer the likes of Germany, Hungary and Slovakia time to reduce their imports of Russian gas and oil but still demonstrate to the Kremlin that its energy revenue from Europe will shrink sharply in the months ahead. Germany has already said it could stop buying Russian oil by the end of the year although it has said it would need some Russian gas imports through 2024.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Spain and Italy became the latest EU countries to kick out Russian officials in a bid, European officials say, to disrupt Russian intelligence and spying networks in the bloc. The EU also said it was asking some Russian officials to leave.\n\nItaly said it would kick out 30 Russian officials and Spain, around 25. The European Union also said it was ordering 19 staff out of Russia\u2019s Brussels mission, where it has around 60 diplomats.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, more than 200 Russian diplomats have now been ordered to leave.",

Lawsuits are not a pleasant experience and I hope that this ruling means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided.\u201d",

          "text": "Following the implementation of a federal government order directing telecommunication companies (telcos) to bar unlinked Subscriber Identification Modules (SIMs) from making outgoing calls, some affected Nigerians have taken to social media as well as stormed the telcos\u2019 offices around Lagos state, to express their displeasure.\n\nThe federal government had on Monday ordered telcos to bar outgoing calls on all unlinked SIM cards in the country.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nConsequently, over 72.77 million active telecommunication subscribers were barred from making calls on their SIMs yesterday, according to a joint statement signed by the Director of Public Affairs of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, and the Head, Corporate Communications at the Nigeria Identity Management Commission, Mr. Kayode Adegokewere.\n\nHowever, speaking with THISDAY during a visit to MTN\u2019s office at the Ketu area of Lagos State, an affected subscriber, Kazeem Owonikoko lamented that although he had linked his SIM to his NIN, he was surprised that his line was also barred from making outgoing calls.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI linked my line since 2021, and I was surprised to wake up this morning and tried to call my business partner and got information that my number has been barred from making outgoing calls.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what is going on, that is why I am here. I still have the message I was sent to confirm that my number has been linked on my phone. I didn\u2019t delete it. This is unfair.\u201d\n\nAnother affected subscriber, Mrs. Bolarinwa Dosunmu lamented that she woke up to meet an urgent message from her daughter who is in a boarding school on her phone and she tried calling her back only to be informed that her number was barred from making outgoing calls.\n\n\u201cMy daughter sent me a message late last night which I woke up to see this morning. I tried reaching her back but discovered my line has been barred from making calls. How do I even reach her? \u201cI don\u2019t even know if she is safe. She is in a boarding school and this is my only line. There should have been a notice to those of us yet to link our lines before this action was taken.\n\n\u201cSome of us are very busy; we don\u2019t even have internet phone or access to news. An SMS reminder on daily basis counting down to the deadline could have saved us all from this mess.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the federal government to open another window for we affected persons to do the linking.\u201d\n\nThe story was not different on Twitter, a social media platform. A Glo user identified as Omotayo of Lagos, wrote, \u201cGlo is always slow in everything until it\u2019s time to start blocking lines because of NIN-SIM linkage. They can\u2019t even wait for 24hours after the announcement before barring people from making calls, so rich coming from a company who can\u2019t provide a stable network for its customers.\u201d\n\nAnother user identified Ehis Aigbe Tweeted: \u201cBandits, kidnappers, and terrorists, particularly in Northern Nigeria, are freely making calls to carry out their wicked acts. Then what is the essence of NIN-SIM linkage?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, David Onyemaizu Tweeted: \u201cThe NIN-SIM linkage is still not relevant. Barring over 72 million subscribers will only affect the service providers and cut down their profits. Also, it won\u2019t prevent any insecurity. Most Nigerians are not ready for government policies that only put a strain on them.\u201d\n\nSunday Ehigiator",

          "text": "International aid agencies on Tuesday raised the alarm that the West African sub-region was currently facing its worst food crisis in a decade, with 27 million people currently going hungry.\n\nIn a damning statement, 11 major international organisations including Oxfam, ALIMA and Save the Children, among others, warned that the figure could even rise to 38 million by June.\n\nThe global aid groups warned that unless urgent action is taken, the increase would mark \u201ca new historic level\u201d and an increase by more than a third during last year.\n\nThe alert came a day ahead of a virtual conference on the food and nutrition crisis in the Sahel and Lake Chad.\n\nA recent report jointly anchored by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) had also warned that acute food insecurity was likely to deteriorate further in Nigeria and 19 other countries, particularly between February and May 2022.\n\nThe reality of hunger is also increasingly manifesting across parts of the continent. President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina estimates that about 250 million Africans live on an empty stomach daily.\n\nAccording to him, hunger has become a way of life on the continent, adding that food systems across the continent were failing to deliver diets that are healthy, affordable, secure and safe for vast swathes of its population.\n\nSince 2015, the number of people in need of emergency food assistance in the West African sub-region \u2013 which includes Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Mali, and Nigeria \u2013 has nearly quadrupled, jumping from seven to 27 million.\n\nOxfam\u2019s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Assalama Dawalack Sidi said the situation had been worsened by drought, floods, conflict, and the economic impacts of COVID-19, which have displaced millions and is \u201cpushing them to the brink.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is not enough food, let alone food that is nutritious enough for children. We must help them urgently because their health, their future and even their lives are at risk,\u201d stressed Save the Children\u2019s Director for West and Central Africa, Philippe Adapoe.\n\nThe United Nations has estimated that 6.3 million children aged 6-59 months will be acutely malnourished this year, an increase of almost 30 per cent from 2021.\n\nWith food increasingly scarce, families\u2019 food sources, especially in the central Sahel, and families increasingly being forced to sell their assets, further jeopardising their productive capacity and the future of their children.\n\nTo add to the already dire situation, experts have predicted that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine could push food prices up to 20 per cent worldwide, \u201can unbearable increase for an already fragile population\u201d.\n\nThe conflict will likely significantly reduce the availability of wheat in the six West African countries, which import at least a third or even as much as half of their consumption volumes from the conflicting countries.\n\nWhile the crisis has shown no sign of abating during the past decade, international donations are drastically reducing. Last year, the humanitarian response plan for West Africa failed to reach half of its scope.\n\n\u201cThe Sahel crisis is one of the worst humanitarian crises on a global scale and, at the same time, one of the least funded. \u201cWe fear that by redirecting humanitarian budgets to the Ukrainian crisis, we risk dangerously aggravating one crisis to respond to another,\u201d said Mamadou Diop, the regional representative of Action Against Hunger.\n\nAccording to the statement, Denmark has announced that it will postpone about half of its entire bilateral development assistance to Burkina Faso and Mali this year, in order to fund the reception of people displaced from Ukraine.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",
