          "title": "Counter-secessionist groups will rise in South-East if IPOB doesn\u2019t stop killings \u2013Umahi",
          "text": "Ebonyi State Governor and Chairman of the South-East Governors\u2019 Forum, Dave Umahi, says counter-secessionist groups will rise in the South-East geopolitical zone if the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra does not call its members to order and stop the threats and killings.\n\nUmahi, who also described the agitation for Biafra as \u201cmadness\u201d, said South-East elite do not want secession but want the zone to be treated fairly and equitably as other zones in the country.\n\nThe governor also vowed that the South-East zone won\u2019t be turned to a killing field and grounded by secessionist agitators.\n\nHe said youths in the region, who shunned dialogue to make their grievances heard and resolved but chose the path of agitation to cause criminality, would be \u201cisolated as criminals\u201d.\n\nUmahi spoke on Wednesday as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\n\u2018MASSOB not violent, IPOB dishes out messages of killings\u2019\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate Minority Leader, who represents Abia South in the red chamber, Enyinnaya Abaribe, had said that aside from IPOB and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, there are more than 30 separatist organisations in the South-East.\n\nBut reacting on Wednesday on the television programme, Umahi said the two separatist groups he knows of are IPOB and MASSOB, adding that Abaribe spoke \u201cfrom the point of his information\u201d.\n\nThe governor stated that while MASSOB has never been violent but IPOB dishes out messages of fear and killings in the zone.\n\nUmahi said, \u201cThe separatist groups, we know of IPOB, we know of MASSOB. MASSOB has never been violent and they are approachable and they tend to reason with us but this other people, IPOB, their command is never in the country and every one of them stays out and dishes out messages of bitterness and messages of threats and fear and killings and are not here with us to feel the pains.\n\n\u201cSo, these are just the two groups that I can talk about but I fear that if IPOB does not call their people to order and stop these threats and killings and all that, other groups will rise up to counter it but there is no way South-East would be grounded, there is no way South-East will be sitting at home while other parts of the country will be doing businesses whereas we are the people that should be moving because we earn our living by moving.\u201d\n\n\u2018IPOB sit-at-home won\u2019t be obeyed if there\u2019s one policeman to everyone\u2019\n\nFurthermore, Umahi said the sit-at-home declared by IPOB to protest the detention of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who has been in the custody of the Department of State Services since June 2021, won\u2019t be obeyed by Southeasterners if there is enough security presence in the zone.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress chieftain also said it was not true that criminals from outside Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra, Abia and Enugu are the ones perpetrating the unprecedented orgies in the South-East. Scores of police stations, offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, amongst others have been burnt by rampaging hoodlums in the South-East of late. Many lives have also been lost to the violence and bloodletting.\n\n\u201cWe are chief security officers in our various states and we understand what is happening; we know that it is our people that are killing our people and they started killing security men, they started burning houses, they started stopping people from moving freely and we started shouting,\u201d the governor said.\n\nOn the sit-at-home order by IPOB on Mondays which has significantly paralysed economic activities in the zone, Umahi said, \u201cPeople are not sitting at home out of obedience or compliance; people are sitting at home out of fear for their lives.\n\n\u201cIf you have a policeman to everybody, nobody is going to obey any sit-at-home, nobody is going to obey that. We are going to do what we have been doing to safeguard the lives of our people because we\u2019ve got the confidence of our people and that you cannot have Biafra by the way they are going about it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Agitation for Biafra madness, South-East elite don\u2019t want secession\u2019\n\nThe governor also described the agitation for secession by IPOB and MASSOB as \u201cmadness\u201d.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, every elite in South-East is not desirous of Biafra, we don\u2019t want Biafra; we want to be treated equally like other regions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, this idea of Biafra, Biafra is madness and we have said, \u2018No\u2019, we don\u2019t want Biafra,\u201d Umahi stated.\n\nThe governor lamented that IPOB and other separatists in the South-East are being given a push by \u201cpretentious agitations\u201d in the South-West and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIf we go our separate ways, South-East people will lose a lot because, we\u2019ve invested a lot in every part of this nation. It is not to our advantage to leave our investment and walk away,\u201d he stated.\n\nBiafra agitation: Back story\n\nDissatisfaction over the Nigerian State and the quest for sovereignty had led the late Biafran leader, Col. Chukwuemeka Ojukwu (retd.), to declare the exit of the Republic of Biafra from Nigeria in May 1967. The Biafran territory essentially comprised the South-East region of Nigeria.\n\nThe declaration led to a civil war that lasted two and half years as the Nigerian State under the then Head of State, Yakubu Gowon, battled to unify the soul of the country using state powers and military might.\n\nThe war ended in January 1970 with the South-East region back in Nigeria but the civil war left a ghoulish imprint on the Nigerian history with squalid tales of deaths, blood, hunger, horror, sorrow and more deaths.\n\nHowever, decades later, secessionist agitations resurfaced in the South-East. The agitations, this time, are being championed by MASSOB leader, Ralph Uwazuruike; as well as his IPOB counterpart, Nnamdi Kanu, amongst other known figures.\n\nThe regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had in September 2017 outlawed IPOB and declared that the activities of the group constituted an act of terrorism and illegality.\n\nBefore then, Kanu was arrested and jailed but was released from the Kuje Prison in Abuja after meeting bail conditions also in 2017. The IPOB leader later left the country and operated from overseas until he was re-arrested in June 2021.\n\nThe detained IPOB leader is facing terrorism charges before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja and his trial has been adjourned to October 21, 2021, for continuation of hearing.",

          "title": "Evans Akere: Innovating African Traditional Wear",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nSince launching his fashion line, Creative Director and CEO of Vanskere, Evans Akere, has become one of the major brands saddled with the responsibility of making African traditional wear acceptable worldwide.\n\nA lawyer by training, his passion and love for fashion, has made his home-grown brand a premium lifestyle brand for men. Renowned for its obsession with craftsmanship, the basic goal Evans says has always been to make stylish and comfortable clothes, a major factor for the brand\u2019s success so far.\n\nWith a clientele list that boasts of politicians, corporate executives and A-list celebrities, Vanskere continues to bridge the market gap for classic, yet, in-trend occasion wear garments tailored for today\u2019s man. Here, he talks about switching from law to the needle profession, the birth of his latest Afro-Athleisure collection- Signore Fusion by Vanskere, (a collection inspired by the COVID19 lockdown) that is now a brand on its own, challenges in the industry and the Nigeria of his dreams.\n\nYou read law in the university, at what point did you embrace fashion?\n\nThat was when I was studying law. I found out that something was not right. I found it difficult to fit in as a law student because I was too elaborate in my dressing. Back then, as a law student, you had to dress corporate in black and white but I like to express myself in my dressing. I like colours.\n\nI remember when I was in law school during my compulsory court attachments, I was actually walked out of court by a Senior Advocate because of the way I was dressed. I wore a purple shirt and a purple tie to court. The judge wanted to take it up that I will not graduate from Law School. I never practiced law or went to court.\n\nI finally made up my mind to do fashion after my call to the Bar. I did not practice.\n\nHow did the VANSKERE brand come to be and how has the brand evolved over the years?\n\nThe VANSKERE brand came to be as a result of my love for fashion. Although I was trained as a lawyer, my passion for fashion supersedes that of law, which made me abandon law. VANSKERE is an abbreviation of my first and last name. It was my nickname from my teenage days. So when it was time for me to set up, it was only logical that I registered the name as the brand name.\n\nThe brand has evolved over the years from a basic fashion brand, to a Luxury fashion brand, with emphasis on modern African traditional wear.\n\nWhat have been your weirdest sources of inspiration for your brand and design direction?\n\nLike I have always said, inspiration is divine, it\u2019s indescribable, and it comes naturally. For an artist, anything can be a source of inspiration. For me, my weirdest source of inspiration has been from lines, curves, and angles.\n\nThe Vanskere brand is fun, but there is also a classic appeal to your apparel. How do you strike an appropriate balance between classic and contemporary?\n\nIt has been easy striking a balance between classic and contemporary fashion because we understand the brand, its core value, and target market. We know it\u2019s imperative that we maintain and sustain our conservative nature, while also meeting the needs of our fashionable customers.\n\nWhat would you consider the biggest challenge as a fashion entrepreneur?\n\nMy biggest challenge from day one has always been how to manage my tailors. In Nigeria, there is a lack of efficient tailors, the few available ones are either not loyal or are badly behaved.\n\nHow have you managed this problem over the years?\n\nManaging tailors is a big challenge like I said, the majority of them are not loyal. If you are lucky, you might have one or two who are, but majority of them are not. It\u2019s more challenging when you have a big factory with many of them; you\u2019ll need to be strong mentally and physically to survive each day. Even when you have a factory manager, majority of the issues still end up on your table.\n\nTo stay above board, I see it as a business hazard that I have to endure daily. So, I\u2019m prepared and ready to face them when I come to work each day.\n\nYou have worked in the fashion industry for quite some years now, what is the best lesson you have learned along the way?\n\nMy best lesson so far would be never to design clothes that suit only my personal style.\n\nHow would you describe the fashion industry in Nigeria today? What would you say are the challenges and way forward?\n\nThe industry has definitely grown over the years, more Nigerians are beginning to appreciate locally made clothes and this has increased the level of patronage. The majority of Nigerian designers have stepped up their game, creating beautiful designs with impeccable finishing. But, there is still a lot of work to be done for our clothes to get that global recognition like we see in the music and movie industry.\n\nThere are lots of challenges in the industry, one of the major one, is lack of a steady power supply; without electricity we can\u2019t produce. A lot of the money we make is spent on buying generators and maintaining them, funds that should have been ploughed back into the business. We don\u2019t even have the enabling environment for business growth and expansion. Basic infrastructures are not available. We do not have textile industries, everything we use including the fabrics are imported. There are no colleges of fashion, only a few institutions offer fashion designing as a course. I could go on and on, but I think the way forward would be for our government to invest in the industry and create an enabling environment.\n\nThe fashion industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. How has the pandemic impacted the Vanskere brand? What was your strategy for staying afloat during the lockdown?\n\nThe pandemic did hit hard on almost every business, but we thank God that the impact wasn\u2019t so hard on the Vanskere brand. We realised that it wasn\u2019t business as usual; we were in an unusual time, so we needed to do the business in an unusual manner. We started off by making face masks for individuals and later scaled up to companies. The sales from the face masks were unbelievable, we couldn\u2019t believe how much we made from it. Then came the easing of lockdown measures; we discovered that most companies were working remotely, while the majority of their staff were working from home. There were no parties and events. Based on this, there was a decline in the purchase of clothes. Then the idea came from our PR team to create comfortable and more casual clothes that could be worn indoors while working and outdoors when socialising. This idea gave birth to the Afro-Athleisure collection under the auspices of our diffusion line \u2013 Signore Fusion by Vanskere. The collection became a huge success and this has become one of our best business decisions in a while. As a result, Signore Fusion is now a brand on its own.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nEverything, I love everything about fashion. I like to study and predict trends; I love to sketch designs and shop for fabrics. I also like to play a major role in the production aspect of the designs.\n\nWhat do you think makes one a successful fashion designer?\n\nI think what makes one a successful fashion designer is the ability to manage change. As a designer, you must have the ability to envisage change, dictate and move with trends.\n\nTell us a bit about your growing up years and what informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nI was born in Edo State. I had my primary and secondary education in Benin-City. My Dad was a successful lawyer, so I wanted to be like him, this made me study law at the university. He indirectly influenced me to study Law. As a young boy growing up, there was this tendency to be like him. But along the line, I realised I was destined to be a designer, but that didn\u2019t make me drop out of school. I completed my law programme before pursuing my passion for fashion. I came to Lagos for my Law school programme, after which, I stayed behind to establish the Vanskere brand. A few years later, I felt the need to have a formal education in fashion, so I went to London to study at the London College of fashion.\n\nDescribe a day in the life of Evans Akere\n\nI start my day with prayers, then go to the gym if its my workout day. I go back home to freshen up and have breakfast, after which I get to work. I work long hours so I get home quite late. I usually look forward to going home to my family after a long day at work. My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

But, there is still a lot of work to be done for our clothes to get that global recognition like we see in the music and movie industry.\n\nThere are lots of challenges in the industry, one of the major one, is lack of a steady power supply; without electricity we can\u2019t produce. A lot of the money we make is spent on buying generators and maintaining them, funds that should have been ploughed back into the business. We don\u2019t even have the enabling environment for business growth and expansion. Basic infrastructures are not available. We do not have textile industries, everything we use including the fabrics are imported. There are no colleges of fashion, only a few institutions offer fashion designing as a course. I could go on and on, but I think the way forward would be for our government to invest in the industry and create an enabling environment.\n\nThe fashion industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. How has the pandemic impacted the Vanskere brand? What was your strategy for staying afloat during the lockdown?\n\nThe pandemic did hit hard on almost every business, but we thank God that the impact wasn\u2019t so hard on the Vanskere brand. We realised that it wasn\u2019t business as usual; we were in an unusual time, so we needed to do the business in an unusual manner. We started off by making face masks for individuals and later scaled up to companies. The sales from the face masks were unbelievable, we couldn\u2019t believe how much we made from it. Then came the easing of lockdown measures; we discovered that most companies were working remotely, while the majority of their staff were working from home. There were no parties and events. Based on this, there was a decline in the purchase of clothes. Then the idea came from our PR team to create comfortable and more casual clothes that could be worn indoors while working and outdoors when socialising. This idea gave birth to the Afro-Athleisure collection under the auspices of our diffusion line \u2013 Signore Fusion by Vanskere. The collection became a huge success and this has become one of our best business decisions in a while. As a result, Signore Fusion is now a brand on its own.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nEverything, I love everything about fashion. I like to study and predict trends; I love to sketch designs and shop for fabrics. I also like to play a major role in the production aspect of the designs.\n\nWhat do you think makes one a successful fashion designer?\n\nI think what makes one a successful fashion designer is the ability to manage change. As a designer, you must have the ability to envisage change, dictate and move with trends.\n\nTell us a bit about your growing up years and what informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nI was born in Edo State. I had my primary and secondary education in Benin-City. My Dad was a successful lawyer, so I wanted to be like him, this made me study law at the university. He indirectly influenced me to study Law. As a young boy growing up, there was this tendency to be like him. But along the line, I realised I was destined to be a designer, but that didn\u2019t make me drop out of school. I completed my law programme before pursuing my passion for fashion. I came to Lagos for my Law school programme, after which, I stayed behind to establish the Vanskere brand. A few years later, I felt the need to have a formal education in fashion, so I went to London to study at the London College of fashion.\n\nDescribe a day in the life of Evans Akere\n\nI start my day with prayers, then go to the gym if its my workout day. I go back home to freshen up and have breakfast, after which I get to work. I work long hours so I get home quite late. I usually look forward to going home to my family after a long day at work. My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAs Nigeria gets set to celebrate her 61st independence anniversary on Thursday, 1st October, Nigeria\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Diaspora Comission (NIDCOM), Hon Abike Dabiri Erewa in this exclusive interview, speaks on some salient issues currently plaguing the country.\n\nThe former House of Representatives Member, who was one of the most vocal voices, especially on the issues of women and children, also opens up on the place of women in politics today, her role and challenges as head of NIDCOM, the issue of migration and of course, the Nigeria of her dreams.\n\nNigeria will on October 1, turn 61 as a nation. At a time like this, do you think there is anything or reason to celebrate?\n\nOf course, there is every reason to celebrate; that we are alive today, that we have a country, and I tell you, it is a country to be proud of. There are challenges no doubt, but we must look at our strengths, rather than our weaknesses. We should look at what unites us rather than what separates us. So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there. But it\u2019s not about government alone, it is about every one of us, at home and in the diaspora, working together to build this great country of ours.\n\nMany Nigerians who trusted your party the APC to bring about change and move them to the next level have had their hopes dashed, with many opting to migrate to other countries. How can hope be rekindled again?\n\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate. You can\u2019t stop migration, legal or illegal. But, try to avoid irregular migration. And also, when you are in another man\u2019s country, it is important that you try to obey the laws of that country. In the UAE for instance, we are bombarded every day with complaints that UAE is not renewing work permits. But we went to see the UAE Ambassador, and he made it clear that there is no official policy from the UAE government about not renewing work permits. But Nigerians are still being denied work permits. In this situation for instance, it\u2019s a case of the bad now affecting the good.\n\nWhen you are in another man\u2019s country and you go to rob a bank in broad daylight in a place like UAE, I condemned it and I listed the names of the four Nigerians who committed the crime. I was criticized for mentioning their names. People felt it was because they were from a particular section of the country, but when you are out there, you are seen as Nigerian first before any tribe.\n\nThis is a country with laws and zero tolerance for crime. Now those guys are serving life imprisonment. In the same UAE, our brothers took cultism there, and they were killing themselves openly. We have seen a lot of things happen and now the bad is affecting the good.\n\nSo what I am telling Nigerians in UAE that are being affected now is, you go out there condemn bad behaviour. Let it be known that those few do not represent who we are as a people. But when you sit down there and you don\u2019t call out those who do these things, then, the bad will definitely affect the good. But I am hoping that the issue of the UAE can be dealt with at the ministerial level, not at my level. However, UAE has said that there is no official policy on the issue.\n\nIn UAE and in other countries, no Nigerian will be allowed to be treated anyhow as instructed by Mr. President and we\u2019ve had a lot of interventions.\n\nBut NIDCOM does not deal with consular issues, it is basically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that deals with consular issues. So, in terms of being treated anyhow, once you don\u2019t commit a crime, we will intervene. But you cannot commit a crime, or break the laws and expect that we are going to beg for you.\n\nThe economic situation in Nigeria has made Nigerians endure indignities in different countries across the globe. How easy or difficult has this home situation made your work as head of NIDCOM?\n\nThis question is general. I\u2019ll take specific cases. In South Africa with the issue of xenophobia, Mr. President intervened himself, it was dealt with.\n\nWe dealt with the issue of Traders in Ghana and the President also sent a delegation.\n\nThe issue of Libya, and Nigerians languishing in Libyan detention centers for years, Mr President set up a committee headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go into detention camps in Libya. We brought thousands of Nigerians back. But guess what, despite all that, people are still going. We need massive awareness campaign. In Lebanon for instance, we brought stranded Nigerians back and one of the girls said to me \u201cI will rather be selling guguru (popcorn) under the bridge than go back there.\u201d\n\nSo, I think if people know that where they are running to is worse than where they are running from, they will have a rethink.\n\nWhat can be done to stem the rise of abuse of Nigerians by their host country?\n\nAny Nigerian, if you are unjustly abused, we will definitely intervene. We have intervened on many occasions. We will not allow you to suffer for a crime you didn\u2019t commit, period. We work with the missions to ensure that no Nigerian is treated unjustly and we also reject stereotyping of Nigerians. If A commits a crime deal with it, don\u2019t say because A committed a crime, you punish B for that because he is a Nigerian. That is not going to happen. We as Nigerians must reject that stereotype.\n\nBut, please, if you don\u2019t obey laws in your own country, you can\u2019t go to another man\u2019s country and disobey. It is as simple as that, but we have definitely been intervening in cases where Nigerians have been affected. Many of them are not even in the media. When we get complaints, we work directly with the missions and a whole lot of times, we get results.\n\nNigeria hasn\u2019t been this divided since Independence, and fingers point at what is generally regarded as poor leadership at the center. What do you make of it?\n\nLeadership has its own role, followership also has its own role. So, let\u2019s look at it holistically. I think as a people, what are our values? What are our morals? What are the things that matter to us? So, I look at it holistically, yes, leadership is a problem, but so is followership. There has to be better participatory democracy, and for the elites in particular who sit back and say \u201coh, I won\u2019t get involved,\u201d to know it is wrong. It is also important for the citizens to demand the best of their leaders.\n\nDo you share the growing notion that Nigeria may cease to exist if current multifaceted problems are not addressed urgently?\n\nI hope not because, Nigeria will emerge strong, but it has to be a united Nigeria, where merit counts, where it doesn\u2019t matter who you know or where you come from and one that will expose the best of your potentials.\n\nI believe that the kind of democracy, or system of government we are practicing now is not meant for us, but we are in it. What do we do to make it better? There has to be devolution of powers to the local and state levels. The strongest arm of government should be the local level. What would the federal government be doing with education in a local community like Imota for instance? I believe in devolution of power. Let powers devolve to the local level, and at that stage, you can have the very strongest in the community head the local government. I mean that is what federalism should be about. The kind of system we are operating now is not working for us, and will not not work for us until we take certain measures and that rests with the National Assembly. The National Assembly needs to look at both the exclusive and concurrent list in the constitution and review them such that more powers go to the local government. If you have a strong local government that is empowered and funded, we will solve a lot of problems.\n\nWhat would you say are the challenges you face as head of NIDCOM and how do you overcome them?\n\nThe greatest challenge is funding, you know it is a new agency, but we don\u2019t let that stop us. We are trying to work on gathering data but Nigerians abroad don\u2019t want to share their data. But we are working at building trust and confidence of Nigerians abroad knowing that it helps in planning.\n\nWhat do you think are some of the ways to help a country like Nigeria help itself, and relieve some of the pressures for emigration?\n\nMr. President is concentrating a lot on infrastructural development, creating the kind of environment where jobs can be created. This is what government is doing under the office of the Vice President, to encourage small businesses and startups. Although not everybody is looking for a job, because from the experience I have had, even if you have the jobs, there are some people who just believe that their destiny is abroad. Why would somebody that has three trailers, sell them for about 10 million naira, decides that he wants to relocate to Europe, gets stuck in Libya and then, comes back with nothing? We need a lot of awareness. It is not rosy out there. Go to the streets of Greece and see Africans including Nigerians, just roaming about; no jobs, they can\u2019t even speak the language and then, they are hawking and not selling anything. Like the lady from Lebanon said, she is better off selling guguru (popcorn) somewhere.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of education that we are providing is not making graduates startup on their own. So, the government has a role to play, but we also have our own roles to play too in letting that young person know not to fall victim of traffickers. So, a lot has to be done by government and us, but you can\u2019t stop migration. If I am below 30 and I find opportunities abroad, of course, I am going to go.\n\nSince your time at the National Assembly, female legislators have not been very vocal. What is happening with the women?\n\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal. There is a bill in place now to create over 100 seats dedicated to women and I think it was sponsored by Hon. Nkiruka. So I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number. When I was in parliament, we were 27; but now, I think they are just half the number both in the House and the Senate. Also, there are less women in political space in terms of leadership. We need to work at making it better.\n\nHow far would you say women have come in terms of politics, since independence?\n\nWe can do better and beyond tokenism which is what the two major parties- APC and PDP are doing now. You know there is no level- playing field, so, I encourage women, If you want a change, you need to leave your comfort zone and be part of politics. I don\u2019t mean you have to contest elections, just let your voices be heard. I started at the local level, attending ward meetings, before I decided to contest elections. If you know it is in you, you need to venture out to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are some cultural issues that still make it difficult for women in politics. But we can\u2019t give up, more women need to participat. So, join a political party, be a leader in your community, go to your ward level, get to know the grassroots, mingle with them, and get to know what is going on. The more women you have in the system, no matter what anybody says, when you give them a task, they deliver.\n\nYou are obviously a very busy woman when you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nI like to be home and to spend time with my family. I love music so I like to sing and dance. Music relaxes me and I try to exercise but a lot of times, you get to lazy to do it. But yes, home is my comfort zone and music relaxes me.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion does your office determine your style? What are you more comfortable in?\n\nThe occasion determines what I wear. I wear what suits me, but of course you know I love Nigerian attires. I remember a lot of times when I travelled, I always bought skirts, suits and trousers; not anymore. Maybe one or two for some occasions. I do love,our Nigerian outfits, and a whole lot of times that I travel, sometimes, I don\u2019t come back with them because somebody likes them and has to take them.\n\nSo, I wear what I feel comfortable in. I believe you can be simple and elegant.\n\nAre you looking at contesting for any political position sometime soon?\n\nWell, right now, I am chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and it has been very challenging setting up a new commission and dealing with millions of Nigerians all over the world. I think my key thing now is just to succeed on the job and set a solid structure on the ground. The future will take care of itself.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dream?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a strong united Nigeria; a Nigeria where it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, who you know, where merit will be our watchword, where you progress because you are good and where your potentials will not be buried. I dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.\n\nOne of our major problems is corruption and corruption is from top to bottom. We just have to tackle that cankerworm called corruption. Having a corrupt-free Nigeria is the only way we can make progress.\n\nAnd then, civil service reforms are quite important; otherwise, the business of government will be difficult.",

But we are working at building trust and confidence of Nigerians abroad knowing that it helps in planning.\n\nWhat do you think are some of the ways to help a country like Nigeria help itself, and relieve some of the pressures for emigration?\n\nMr. President is concentrating a lot on infrastructural development, creating the kind of environment where jobs can be created. This is what government is doing under the office of the Vice President, to encourage small businesses and startups. Although not everybody is looking for a job, because from the experience I have had, even if you have the jobs, there are some people who just believe that their destiny is abroad. Why would somebody that has three trailers, sell them for about 10 million naira, decides that he wants to relocate to Europe, gets stuck in Libya and then, comes back with nothing? We need a lot of awareness. It is not rosy out there. Go to the streets of Greece and see Africans including Nigerians, just roaming about; no jobs, they can\u2019t even speak the language and then, they are hawking and not selling anything. Like the lady from Lebanon said, she is better off selling guguru (popcorn) somewhere.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of education that we are providing is not making graduates startup on their own. So, the government has a role to play, but we also have our own roles to play too in letting that young person know not to fall victim of traffickers. So, a lot has to be done by government and us, but you can\u2019t stop migration. If I am below 30 and I find opportunities abroad, of course, I am going to go.\n\nSince your time at the National Assembly, female legislators have not been very vocal. What is happening with the women?\n\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal. There is a bill in place now to create over 100 seats dedicated to women and I think it was sponsored by Hon. Nkiruka. So I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number. When I was in parliament, we were 27; but now, I think they are just half the number both in the House and the Senate. Also, there are less women in political space in terms of leadership. We need to work at making it better.\n\nHow far would you say women have come in terms of politics, since independence?\n\nWe can do better and beyond tokenism which is what the two major parties- APC and PDP are doing now. You know there is no level- playing field, so, I encourage women, If you want a change, you need to leave your comfort zone and be part of politics. I don\u2019t mean you have to contest elections, just let your voices be heard. I started at the local level, attending ward meetings, before I decided to contest elections. If you know it is in you, you need to venture out to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are some cultural issues that still make it difficult for women in politics. But we can\u2019t give up, more women need to participat. So, join a political party, be a leader in your community, go to your ward level, get to know the grassroots, mingle with them, and get to know what is going on. The more women you have in the system, no matter what anybody says, when you give them a task, they deliver.\n\nYou are obviously a very busy woman when you are not working, how do you spend your \u2018me\u2019 time?\n\nI like to be home and to spend time with my family. I love music so I like to sing and dance. Music relaxes me and I try to exercise but a lot of times, you get to lazy to do it. But yes, home is my comfort zone and music relaxes me.\n\nWhen it comes to fashion does your office determine your style? What are you more comfortable in?\n\nThe occasion determines what I wear. I wear what suits me, but of course you know I love Nigerian attires. I remember a lot of times when I travelled, I always bought skirts, suits and trousers; not anymore. Maybe one or two for some occasions. I do love,our Nigerian outfits, and a whole lot of times that I travel, sometimes, I don\u2019t come back with them because somebody likes them and has to take them.\n\nSo, I wear what I feel comfortable in. I believe you can be simple and elegant.\n\nAre you looking at contesting for any political position sometime soon?\n\nWell, right now, I am chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission and it has been very challenging setting up a new commission and dealing with millions of Nigerians all over the world. I think my key thing now is just to succeed on the job and set a solid structure on the ground. The future will take care of itself.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dream?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a strong united Nigeria; a Nigeria where it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, who you know, where merit will be our watchword, where you progress because you are good and where your potentials will not be buried. I dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.\n\nOne of our major problems is corruption and corruption is from top to bottom. We just have to tackle that cankerworm called corruption. Having a corrupt-free Nigeria is the only way we can make progress.\n\nAnd then, civil service reforms are quite important; otherwise, the business of government will be difficult.",
          "summary": "So, yes, Nigeria is not where it should be at 61, but gradually, we will get there.\nI don\u2019t know what you mean by the situation in Nigeria, what we encourage is, you can migrate.\nI don\u2019t think women in the parliament are less vocal.\nSo I don\u2019t think women are less vocal, they are less in number.\nI dream of a free, fair, equitable Nigeria, a Nigeria where poverty will be absolutely and totally reduced, a Nigeria where everybody can live comfortably, where the rich will not be getting richer and the poor getting poorer and a Nigeria where corruption will be totally gone.",

          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nWith Africa\u2019s healthcare system on the brink of collapse, Nigerian born UK based Mmekidmfon Umanah, is on a mission to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system via his project company; Aimcare Health Limited a product sourcing company that is building the healthcare bridge between Europe and West Africa by connecting European health startups to the unique market opportunities in West Africa.\n\nA Chevening alumnus with an MSc in International Development from the University of Birmingham, with an incoming PhD in Business and Management candidate at the King\u2019s College London, Mmekidmfon also serves as the Executive Director of WaterEase Organization, a nonprofit using resource mobilisation and advocacy to help underserved communities have better access to clean water in Nigeria.\n\nSo far, through his advocacy work, four communities in have been provided with clean water, with a community in Bauchi as the latest beneficiary.\n\nMmekidmfon shares his motivating factor and overall mission for his work.\n\nWhat is the motive behind the creation of Aimcare? What inspired it?\n\nThe truth is that the African healthcare system is simply broken, and this cost me my mother\u2019s life in 2013. For 80% of people in Africa, their community pharmacy and patent medicine stores are the frontlines of their health system and, yet they routinely stock out of essential medicines, incur significant losses to expiry, and struggle with substandard and falsified drugs and medical consumables. Where immunizations, contraceptives, anti-infectives, essential devices, and diagnostics, or chronic-care at the local clinic or pharmacy are expired, too expensive, or simply unavailable, providers, patients, and whole communities pay the price; we are currently working to prevent these. . Hence, I am committed to tackling this issue through Aimcare, working our way up from just inventory access and financing to infrastructure financing.\n\nWe are ensuring that consumers have access to the best and most innovative products in the market regardless of their location or economic status.\n\nAnd how do you go about achieving your goal?\n\nAimcare Health Limited\u2019s mission is to strengthen the West African frontline and primary healthcare system by providing pharmacies, primary healthcare centres, patent medicine stores and hospitals with the most innovative, user-friendly, and affordable products in the global market. We are currently doing this by connecting global health start-ups to unique and high-potential opportunities on the African continent. We focus on non-clich\u00e9 opportunities in the healthcare ecosystem from piloting disruptive technology to marketing innovative consumer products and wearables. By leveraging on our unique partnership channels, we have built access to 1000 pharmacies, 200 patient medicine stores and 50 clinics.\n\nDot Glasses is one of the foreign start-ups we are working with. We are their sole partners in Nigeria and we are enabling the facilities as listed above to get access to this affordable yet quality vision care solution.\n\nHow is Aimcare financed?\n\nAimcare is a for-profit startup and primarily we make money from our services. For a while, people used to erroneously think we are a non-profit, and possibly this came from the fact that we are involved with a lot of impact projects. For instance, we have a project that involves distributing birth kits to pregnant women in rural communities through the traditional birth attendant homes and distributing hygiene kits to boarding secondary schools. The reality though is that these projects are now part of our non-profit vehicle\u2019s (Waterease) value proposition and no more Aimcare directly.\n\nAt what point did the Dot Glasses project come in and what informed it?\n\nAimcare currently has an exclusive partnership with a Czech based company called DOT Glasses, tell us about it?\n\nDOT Glasses is a Czech-based vision Care Company that has developed proprietary on-spot testing that allows us to test, diagnose and provide our customised prescription lenses on the spot all in less than 4 minutes for a total cost of $4. DOT Glasses is the first sustainable solution to the world\u2019s vision problem. With their patented, snap-together, adjustable frames designed by a subsidiary of Mercedes Benz; Impact and scratch-resistant lenses; simple proprietary vision testing tools; and extraordinarily robust 100% injection-molded ABS plastic, they ensure the end-user has access to quality prescription lenses at an ultra-affordable rate.\n\nTell us your achievement with DOT glasses project in Nigeria?\n\nFrom inception to-date we have sold about six thousand five-hundred DOT glasses and partnered with some non-commercial partners like Akwa Ibom State government and the Ini Ememobong Foundation to distribute 500 for free. We have in the process provided eye tests for one thousand people. We\u2019ve partnered with the government and private companies to distribute 7000 pairs of these glasses since March this year\n\nFrom all you have done, your projects seem to focus more on the northern part of Nigeria, why is that so and when are you extending to other parts of the country?\n\nWe do have some presence in the North. We have partners in Kebbi, Zaria and Abuja. Also, A few months ago, Aimcare\u2019s non-profit vehicle; Waterease Organisation, provided clean water to the good people of Dasham Community in Bauchi State by building them a borehole. That project will provide water to 700 people in and around that community. However, our biggest business comes from Lagos. Most of our commercial partners are in Lagos.\n\nWhat is your future projection for Aimcare?\n\nAs far as future projections go, our midterm goal is to disrupt the industry by helping primary healthcare facilities avoid stock outs and have uninterrupted access to inventory. We want to be able to improve access to medicines and medical products by providing innovative financing and inventory management solutions to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.\n\nOur long term goal is to be able to facilitate healthcare investment to the continent by financing infrastructure.\n\nYou are gradually bridging the gap in the healthcare sector, using Aimcare in providing opportunities, what have been the challenges you have encountered so far?\n\nThe challenges we are facing are perhaps not significantly different from the challenges many businesses in Nigeria are facing. For instance, our business is very reliant on FX and a few months ago we were doing business at N400 to $1. Currently we are doing business at N510 to $1. This makes things very difficult especially for companies like us aiming to ensure the prices of our products are super affordable.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you and what events shaped you into the person you are today?\n\nGrowing was fun. We did not have a lot, but my parents ensured I got the best education I could possibly have gotten. I attended private schools at both nursery and primary and secondary school levels. I remember that my secondary school was quite pricey at the time, and it makes me wonder how my parents were able to afford, as I look back in retrospect.\n\nI generally had a slow start in life; I could not read a timepiece until I was about 10, 11 years old. But as an only child, my mother\u2019s support was relentless. She used to call me Doctor and always wanted me to be a Doctor. I hope as she looks down from heaven, she is proud that I am on my way to getting a Doctorate and I\u2019ll truly be called a Doctor even though it is not medical. But even importantly, I hope she is even more proud that I am running a successful healthcare start-up that is tackling some of the things that cost her life.",

I thank you for finding me fit for this award,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Shaibu, Edo State Deputy Governor, the honour is well cherished.\n\n\u201cI am deeply honoured and happy. I will say I am privileged to be among those you have nominated for 2020 award.\u201d\n\nShaibu acknowledged that \u201cThe Sun is one major newspaper in Nigeria that you cannot take your eyes off each time you go to the newspaper stand. \u201cYou have made a name for yourself in terms of reportage; you have also made a name for yourself, in terms of combining news, entertainment, sports, business etc.,\u201d the deputy governor said.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cI am honoured because I always like to be given award when it is merited and this award is coming when I was not expecting any.\n\n\u201cI love awards that are not solicited for. This one is one of them and that is why I am deeply honoured.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is not just an award; this is another effort at spurring me to do what I am being awarded to do better.

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri and From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha\n\nA personnel of the Department of State Services (DSS), Ezeonye Ozuzu, was reportedly killed, on Monday, while engaging hoodlums who were forcefully enforcing the sit-at-home directive of the Indigenous People of Biafra, in Imo State.\n\nThe officer was said to be among the task force team deployed to Anambra State, a few hours after the burning of the DSS office in Nnewi, according to a family source. He was said to have been killed while returning to his station.\n\nMr Dan Opara, a relation to the deceased told Daily Sun that their family got to know of his death when a report came from the DSS office in Owerri, informing them of the death of Ozuzu, allegedly killed by gunmen at Ukwu-Orji, along Owerri-Onitsha road.\n\nBut the family, according to Opara, got another twist to the report when they saw three bullet wounds, contrary to one reported to them by the DSS, at their office, which he said prompted them to dig further into the incident.\n\nOpara said the initial report received by the family was that gunmen, who engaged the task force team in a gun duel, at Ukwu-Orji, had killed the DSS officer, said to be the driver of the team. But another report claimed that the 34-year-old DSS officer from Umuoyo, Irete, in Owerri West Council Area of the state, was killed by an accidental discharge from a member of the team of the task force.\n\nMeanwhile, the corpse of the officer, the deceased cousin said, has been deposited at the mortuary.\n\nWhen contacted, the State police spokesperson, Michael Abattam, said he was not aware of the incident.\n\nGunmen kill 2, injure 3 in Enugu\n\nGunmen, yesterday, invaded the security office of the Central Neighbourhood Watch at Ogrute, Enugu Ezike, Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area, Enugu State, killing the Commander and one other, while three others sustained injuries.\n\nSources said the attackers numbering about 12 arrived at the scene around 1am yesterday morning, on six motorcycles, and opened fire on the security personnel who took strategic positions within the vicinity.\n\nThey reportedly shot one of the security personnel known as Akwete before they ordered another security man to lead them to the room, where the commander, identified as Chinedu Urama, stayed.\n\nThe gunmen reportedly sprayed Urama with bullets, but none penetrated before they resorted to use of dangerous weapons like dagger, axe and heavy wooden planks on him until they left him dead.\n\nNot done yet, they set ablaze four security vehicles parked in the premises, including two Sienna buses donated to the security outfit by Enugu-Ezike indigenes in Diaspora, during their last reunion in December 2020.\n\nWhen the reporter visited the scene yesterday morning, there were uncontrollable wailing as onlookers and sympathisers besieged the area. Many described the deceased Commander as a crime cracker who bursted and also recorded several successes in crime fighting in the area.\n\nPolicemen from Enugu Ezike Division had visited the scene and also cordoned off the premises, while the Chairman of Igbo-Eze North LGA, Prince Ejike Itodo, who earlier visited, was devastated over the incident and assured that justice will be served over the incident.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThere is mounting pressure on the United States government to designate secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a terrorist organisation.\n\nAn article in Washington Times is calling on US authorities to designate IPOB a terror group following acts of violence and mindless killings linked to it.\n\nThe article, noted that, IPOB had curiously sued the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin in a U.S. federal court.\n\nDr. Chike Akunyili, widower of former NAFDAC DG and Minister of Information, the late Dr. Dora Akunyili and eight others were killed in Onitsha, Anambra State, last week, including several other assassinations and killing of security agents linked to the group.\n\nOthers killed in the same gruesome manner included a former Head of Scientific Equipment Development Institute, Enugu, Professor SN Ndubisi; a federal high court Judge, Justice Stanley Nnaji; a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak; a traditional ruler, Chief Alexander Eduzueuno; Anglican priest, Rev. Emeka Merenu; and a young lawyer, Darlington Prime, among many others.\n\nThere were, however, arguments that there might be other groups exploiting the situation in the South-eastern part of the country to perpetrate criminal activities.\n\nThe piece written by the Executive Director of the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Baltimore, Ivan Sascha Sheehan, expressed displeasure that, \u201cthe violent secessionist group in question \u2013 the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) \u2013 is yet to be designated a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) by the US Department of State.\n\n\u201cThis is despite repeated pleas to do so by longstanding U.S. ally, Nigeria, where IPOB is based and carries out its murderous activities. It is difficult to explain how U.S. interests are served by inaction and complacency on IPOB. The listing costs nothing. But the designation would have significant implications for the group\u2019s continuance.\u201d\n\nThe publication noted that as soon as the designation was applied, no organisation that utilises U.S. currency would be able to legally conduct transactions with the organisation.\n\n\u201cBy cutting off IPOB\u2019s funding, the U.S. would weaken the 50,000 strong paramilitary outfit and provide Nigeria\u2019s security forces room to train their sights squarely on ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram in the Northeast of the country. Counterterrorism operations against Boko Haram have long been assisted by U.S. agencies working in close coordination with the West African government,\u201d it said.\n\nIt contended that though IPOB might appear to be Abuja\u2019s problem alone, the militants had served as a distraction and bled precious resources, noting that over the past eighteen months, Boko Haram had regrettably been able to regroup and rejuvenate.\n\n\u201cThe same is true of Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups across the volatile Sahel region. That the African continent is rapidly becoming a staging ground for global terror operations should concern U.S. officials. But Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB\u2019s leader, is clearly unconcerned. That he feels no need to even disguise his support of terrorism is worrisome.\n\n\u201cThough IPOB\u2019s principal aim is to restore a breakaway state of Biafra in the Southeastern parts of Nigeria, Mr. Kanu\u2019s rhetoric, has become increasingly strident. \u2018I don\u2019t want peaceful actualisation (of Biafra),\u2019 Mr. Kanu has said through his Radio Biafra channel, used to project threats, instructions, and propaganda into Nigeria from the safety of London. \u2018If they don\u2019t (give us Biafra), they will die.\u2019\n\n\u201cNeither does Mr. Kanu make idle threats. The December revelation of IPOB\u2019s 50,000 strong-armed paramilitary wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), complete with a Swastika-style flag, marked the end to all pretences of being a peaceful movement. What had been largely unspoken was publicly declared. Since then, violent IPOB attacks on both security personnel and civilians have surged by a terrifying 59%; deaths by 344%\u201d, it said.\n\nThe report noted that more than 20 attacks were carried out in the first three months of this year alone, including the retribution-style bombing of a local state governor\u2019s home, where four were killed, and an attack on a prison that freed some 2,000 dangerous criminals. Even neighboring states were forced to impose curfews to protect their citizens from marauders.\n\n\u201cThere is also a nasty racial element to the IPOB attacks. In addition to attacks on the state, much of their violence is directed towards the Fulani people, a nomadic tribe of herders that roam across West Africa. Through Biafra Radio, IPOB regularly calls on its supporters to not only kill the Fulani, but to kill \u201cany landlord that gives accommodation or rents his house or her house to a Fulani person.\n\n\u201cIn one recent attack on a Fulani community, six young children were butchered with machetes \u2013 one, a baby, was burned alive. Their bodies were discarded in mass graves,\u201d it said.\n\nCriminal herdsmen have also been accused of embarking on a campaign of kidnapping, killing and rape of women across Nigeria.\n\nFulani militant group operating in Nigeria and parts of the Central African Republic was described in the Global Terrorism Index as the fourth deadliest known terrorist group operating in Nigeria and parts of the Central African Republic.\n\nThe GTI stated that in 2013, the Fulani killed around 80 people in total \u2013 but by 2014 the group had killed 1,229.\n\nThe Washington Times report cited an example of all the governors of Southeast Nigeria bowing to a 14-day ultimatum to ban open grazing in their districts \u2013 a move targeting the livelihoods of the Fulani \u2013 rather than face the wrath of the ESN.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, it enforces a sit-at-home day every Monday, intended to economically cripple the region, through acts like the torching of passenger buses.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has correctly prescribed terror labels to other secessionist groups that employ these tactics \u2013 the ETA in Spain, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and the PKK in Turkey. Now, the people IPOB claims to represent, the Igbo, are even seeking to distance themselves from the group\u201d, it said.\n\nThe publication raises posers as to the reason the group was yet to be labelled a terror group.\n\n\u201cOne reason may be the group\u2019s million-dollar contracts with prominent American lobbying firms paid to whitewash the group\u2019s reputation and lobby on Capitol Hill. It is impossible to believe that IPOB and Kanu\u2019s deep pockets are not being lined by external organisations.\n\n\u201cA terror designation would put a stop to this influence peddling. It would also mean the group could not use the US or its Western allies, like London-based Radio Biafra, to further their cause,\u201d it said.\n\nThe report wondered why \u201can African terrorist organisation is suing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in U.S. federal court,\u201d saying, \u201cIt beggars belief\u201d.\n\nThe Washington Times report said, \u201cThe group\u2019s outsized influence \u2013 a function of its radio station, paid hands, and US lawyers \u2013 would be severely curtailed. Law enforcement in the US, the U.K., and elsewhere would be obligated to act by shutting down these activities.\n\n\u201cThat a small terrorist organisation can bully senior U.S. officials in American courts and leverage the influence of foreign agents to challenge an ally\u2019s security would be laughable were it not so alarming. Washington must not ignore Nigeria\u2019s terrorists any longer.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Olofu been redeployed to the Force Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nHowever, speaking on the dire situation in Anambra, Yakubu lamented that never before in Nigeria\u2019s history had the importance of election security in a governorship election been this urgent.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Commission is aware that this is by no means an easy task. We appreciate the enormous challenges that the security agencies are presently facing in Anambra State, which entail not only securing the electoral process, but also enforcing law and order generally. This is particularly worrisome because the security agencies have also become prime targets of these mindless attacks.\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of these recent and seemingly escalating threats to the election that the Commission has convened this emergency meeting. We will continue to work with the security agencies and in consultation with respected opinion leaders in Anambra State and the National Peace Committee to ensure that these hit-and-run attacks do not derail the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is particularly concerned about the safety of voters and Election Day staff, including security officials, who have also become the targets of these attacks. The thousands of young Nigerians that we intend to deploy for the election, most of them National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members and university students, need to be reassured of their personal safety.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, deployment for the election will involve the movement of huge consignments of sensitive and non-sensitive materials to the 21 local government areas of the state, 326 wards or registration areas and 5,720 polling units.\n\n\u201cThat means over 6,000 locations to be protected. If we add that to about 26,000 officials that will be deployed for the election, we begin to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge of securing the Anambra governorship election, which is only thirty-two (32) days from today.\u201d\n\nHe told the security meeting that from the reports INEC had received, the goal of many of the attackers was that the governorship election must not hold.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is worrisome for the Commission. We are deeply concerned that specific electoral facilities and materials could once more become targets of attack. Recall that in May this year, our state office at Awka was attacked and all the non-sensitive materials assembled for the election at the time were destroyed.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our store, collation centre and the main office building were either totally or substantially damaged. The Commission also lost several vehicles to be used for the election.\u201d\n\nHe said though the commission had almost fully recovered from the attacks, as the destroyed buildings had either been completely repaired or were nearing completion, whilst they had fully replaced the materials destroyed.\n\nHe explained that the rapid recovery has only been possible, because the Anambra election was an off-season poll, adding: \u201cWe have sourced some of these materials such as the 326 electric generators and vehicles destroyed in the attack from neighbouring states. However, should we again lose vital materials and facilities, the ongoing preparations will be adversely affected.\u201d\n\nHe, however, assured the people of Anambra State that the Commission was determined to proceed with the election as scheduled.\n\nTo underscore this determination, he said, \u201cThe Commission is implementing two more activities on the Timetable for the election in the next few days. The register of voters will be presented to political parties in Awka on Thursday 7th October 2021. On the same day, the Commission will publish the final list of candidates for the election.\u201d\n\nHe declared that the commission was confident that at the end of this meeting, it would firm up on specific measures necessary to further guarantee the safety of all persons involved in the election from the voters to election officials, observers, media organisations and the security of election materials.\n\nHe informed the security meeting that INEC had received briefings and reviewed preparations for the election, saying, \u201cYou may also recall that a major concern raised by members was the security situation in the state in particular and the adjoining states in general and how this might affect preparations and possibly, the conduct of the election.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, he said the situation has deteriorated markedly since the last meeting as many innocent lives had been lost and property destroyed.\n\nThe NSA, Monguno, represented by Sanusi Galadima, said security threat posed by violent activities of separatist groups in the South-East region were bent on scuttling the election in the state in furtherance of their separatist agenda.\n\nThis, he claimed, constituted a clear and present danger to the nation\u2019s democratic process and consolidation.\n\n\u201cI wish to state that ONSA is working assiduously with relevant security and intelligence agencies towards arresting the foregoing ugly trend and other associated security challenges in the South East zone and beyond.\n\n\u201cThis determination of the presidency is already being translated into action by the recent joint Military operation code-named \u2018Golden Dawn\u2019 in the South East as well as other security operations across the country.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the increasing collaboration between the federal and South East Governors towards addressing the underlying socio-economic drivers of insecurity in the region,\u201d the NSA said.\n\nHe reiterated the federal government\u2019s commitment to the protection of lives and property of all law abiding citizens before, during and after the elections, while calling on all peace-loving Nigerians of the South East extraction to join hands with constituted authority to promote peace and development across the region and beyond.\n\nOn the change of guard in Anambra, Baba, after redeploying the police chief, also ordered the deployment of a detachment of NPF Special Forces to Anambra to bolster and complement the ongoing peace-building efforts of the Nigeria Police Operation Restore Peace in the state.\n\nThe IG, who was particularly concerned about the renewed incidents of attacks on innocent individuals and symbol of state authority, ordered the new commissioner to mobilise both kinetic and non-kinetic law enforcement and crime-fighting approaches to reverse the negative trend, reclaim public spaces from hoodlums and restore public peace in the state.\n\nEcheng, who until his recent posting, was the Commissioner of Police in-charge of Bayelsa State, had his first degree in History from the University of Maiduguri.\n\nAn experienced peace-builder, he received extensive training on global peace support operations at Mission Training Cell, Kielce, Poland, amongst other tactical and leadership courses.\n\nHe has also served as a Police Component Commander, Joint Task Force, Operation Delta Safe and Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of Zonal CID, Zone-13, Ukpo, Anambra State, amongst other key positions.\n\nBaba charged the new Police Chief to work with other stakeholders and patriotic forces in Anambra to restore law and order, leveraging his professional experience, even as he called on Ndi-Anambra to support and cooperate with him in his task to protect the lives and property of all.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022England approves first drug in 20 years\n\nObinna Chima\n\nA major breakthrough has been made in healthcare, giving hope to millions of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) sufferers across the globe, especially in Nigeria which currently ranks highest in rate of SCD in the world, as the first treatment for the disease in over 20 years has been approved in England by the National Health Service (NHS).\n\nThe drug, Crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into a vein and can be taken on its own or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions.\n\nAnd in a trial, patients taking the crizanlizumab had a sickle-cell crisis 1.6 times a year on average, compared with nearly three times a year normally.\n\nThe NHS which disclosed this in a statement posted on its website yesterday, described the development as revolutionary.\n\nPeople with SCD endure severe pain during the \u2018sickle cell crisis\u2019 that can occur multiple times per year, often requiring hospital admission so they can be given morphine to control the pain and prevent organ failure which can be fatal.\n\nAnnouncing the new treatment, NHS\u2019 chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said the drug deal would help as many as 5,000 people over the next three years to have a much better quality of life.\n\nNigeria has an estimated 25 per cent of its adult population being carriers of defective S-gene. SCD is a genetic (hereditary) disorder that occurs when an individual has inherited two mutant (abnormal) haemoglobin (Hb) genes from both parents, at least one of which is HbS and the resulting symptoms and signs are due to abnormality in the shape of red blood cells.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire recently disclosed that available record showed that SCD affects nearly 100 million people in the world and was also responsible for over 50 per cent of deaths in those with the most severe form of the disease (Hb SS).\n\nHe had said sickle cell was the most prevalent genetic disease in Africa, adding that in many countries in the country, including Nigeria, 10 to 40 per cent of the population carry the sickle-cell gene resulting in estimated SCD prevalence of at least two per cent.\n\nHe had estimated that 150,000 affected children are born every year in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigeria currently has the highest burden of Sickle Cell Disease in the whole World ahead of Democratic Republic of Congo and India, with an estimated 25 per cent of her adult population being carriers of defective S-gene.\n\n\u201cWHO in 2015 estimated that two per cent of new-borns in Nigeria are affected by sickle cell anaemia, giving a total of about 150,000 affected children born every year. About 50 per cent\u201380 per cent of the estimated 150,000 infants born yearly with SCD in Nigeria die before the age of five years and those that manage to survive suffer end-organs damage which shortens their lifespan including stroke,\u201d Ehanire had said.\n\nContinuing, Pritchard said patients with sickle cell suffer from monthly episodes, making it difficult for people to continue in their jobs or other everyday activities.\n\n\u201cThe hereditary condition is much more prevalent among people from African or African-Caribbean origin.\n\nThe drug will also reduce the number of times a sickle cell patient needs to go to A&E by two fifths,\u201d the NHS boss explained.\n\nLast year, NHS England set up ten new dedicated centres to treat sickle cell disease across the country and patients would be able to access the new treatment through their consultant at one of these clinics.\n\nThe NHS agreed a deal to make Crizanlizumab available for patients earlier than would have otherwise been possible at a price that is fair for taxpayers.\n\nIt was the latest in a line of deals secured by the NHS, including a new cholesterol-busting jab and lung cancer drug last month as well as the world\u2019s most expensive drug which treats spinal muscular atrophy in infants, earlier in the year.\n\nPritchard added: \u201cThis is a historic moment for people with sickle cell disease who will be given their first new treatment in over two decades.\n\n\u201cThis revolutionary treatment will help to save lives, allow patients to have a better quality of life and reduce trips to A&E by almost half.\n\n\u201cThe NHS has agreed a deal for this drug, so we are able to provide the latest and best possible treatments for patients at a price that is affordable for taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThis announcement paves the way for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to publish final guidance on Crizanlizumab which would take into consideration the data that would be collected as part of the agreement.\n\nPeople aged 16 and over who suffer from multiple sickle cell crises, or vaso-occlusive crises as they are scientifically known, per year would be eligible for the treatment.\n\nToks Odesanmi, a sickle cell patient at Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, was quoted to have said: \u201cSickle Cell Disease has defined me, defined my body and made a big dent to my dreams.\n\n\u201cNo matter how hard I fight it continues to defeat me. A new treatment brings hope and might make dreaming possible again\u201d.\n\nThe Chair of the Sickle Cell Society, Kye Gbangbola MBA, said: \u201cA new treatment brings new hope for people living with Sickle Cell Disorder, the world\u2019s most common genetic blood condition.\n\n\u201cSCD is a \u2018medical emergency\u2019; it causes excruciating pain, this new treatment will reduce the number of agonising pain episodes we have to endure. The hope is improved quality of life for many living with the condition and their families\u201d.\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cIt is fantastic news that this ground-breaking new treatment for sickle cell disease will soon be available in England where it will make a difference to thousands of people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThe UK has proven itself to be a world leader in rolling out innovative, life-saving treatments to ensure every NHS patient gets access to the medicines they deserve.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic day for those living with this condition and I want to extend my thanks to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NHS England and Novartis for their work to provide this vital treatment to the patients who need it.\u201d\n\nNovartis Oncology President, Susanne Schaffert, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is reflective of the new approach to partnerships with healthcare systems that Novartis is taking around the world, to drive equity of access for people living with potentially debilitating conditions such as sickle cell.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that this close partnership with NICE, N\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sanwo-Olu reiterates demand for special status\n\n\u2022Says prosperity of Lagos has multiplier effect on S\u2019West, Nigeria\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Government yesterday demanded one per cent share in the federal revenue allocation formula, maintaining that the state\u2019s unique features and its prosperity bear on development in the South-west and Nigeria, generally.\n\nThe government canvassed a special status designation for Lagos State, and proposed that the revenue sharing formula should be 34 per cent for the federal government, one per cent for the Federal Capital Territory, 42 per cent for state governments, 23 per cent for local governments, and one per cent for Lagos State (Special Status). This is against the current revenue allocation formula, which gives the federal government 52.68 per cent, the 36 state governments 26.72 per cent, and the 774 local governments 20.60 per cent.\n\nThe Lagos State government\u2019s demands were made by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the opening of a two-day South-west zonal public hearing on review of the revenue allocation formula, organised in Lagos by the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\nIn a memorandum on review of revenue allocation formula, which he submitted to the RMAFC, Sanwo-Olu declared that allocating one per cent to Lagos State (Special Status) and allowing the three tiers of government to share 99 per cent in a new revenue sharing formula was straightforward, self-justifying and in no way controversial. He said the review of the current revenue allocation formula was long overdue, stressing that the best way to guarantee national progress and development is to pay attention to sub-national development since the national is a summation of the sub-national.\n\nThe governor reiterated the call for Lagos State to be accorded special status in recognition of its huge financial commitments to infrastructure and provision of basic amenities for the increasing population of residents, as well as its preeminent contribution to the national coffers. He said the call, which had been re-echoed at different forums, could not be overemphasised, especially against the backdrop of the current economic situation of the country, the aftermath of the EndSARS protests, and the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which Lagos had been the national epicentre.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOur demand is a sharing formula that is just, fair and equitable; reflecting the contribution of stakeholders to the common purse; and also one that enhances the capacity of state and local governments to deliver high-quality services and the full dividends of democracy to the greatest number of our people.\n\n\u201cLagos State is, no doubt, the nation\u2019s commercial capital, and population centre. The level of funding required to service the state\u2019s social and public infrastructure is so significant that it will be difficult for the state to bear the burden for much longer under the present arrangement.\n\n\u201cI should say that it will actually be unfair to expect the state to bear this heavy burden on its own. It is, therefore, necessary to give due consideration to all the variables that support our advocacy for a special status.\n\n\u201cThe call for a special status for Lagos is not a selfish proposition; it is in the best interest of the country and all Nigerians, for Lagos which accounts for about 20 per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and about 10 per cent of the nation\u2019s population to continue to prosper.\u201d\n\nFurther defending the demand for special status, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos was more than just another state in the Nigerian federation, saying there is no tribe in the country without significant stake in the state.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the former capital of the country for 77 years (compared to the 30 years that Abuja has been the Federal Capital Territory), Nigeria\u2019s largest metropolis still bears the heavy brunt of being home to all Nigerians; irrespective of age, class, gender, religious affiliation or tribe.\n\n\u201cThere are several statistics that show the number of people that come into Lagos every day, however, there are clear indications that most of these people migrate with the intention to make Lagos their new home and in pursuit of personal dreams due to the opportunities the city-state seemingly possesses, and this portends additional responsibilities on the government.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Lagos still harbours a huge number of federal establishments, which could not be moved to Abuja. These include military cantonments and barracks, Police, Customs, Immigration, Civil Defence, Prisons, Road Safety and security/intelligence establishments.\n\n\u201cThere are several reasons to justify the call for a special status for Lagos apart from the aforementioned factors and by extension, a review of the Revenue Allocation Sharing Formula.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu also said it would be unfair for Lagos to be left alone to bear the burden of the massive destruction experienced by the state during the EndSARS protests, which were hijacked by hoodlums, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis month marks one year after the massive destruction experienced by the state in the violence that accompanied the hijacking of the EndSARS protests. Public buildings were burnt down, and historical infrastructure destroyed.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we have put that experience behind us and forged ahead, the reality of this unfortunate incident remains with us; resources that should be committed to other areas of need are now being used for the restoration of these public facilities. It will be totally unfair for Lagos State to be left alone to bear these huge expenses without assistance from the centre.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 pandemic is another issue that has once again, supported the justification for Lagos to be accorded the privilege of a special status. As much as this affects the entire country, it is a fact that the degree of havoc caused by this virus differs from state to state.\n\n\u201cLagos was the epicentre for this virus, the same way it was for the Ebola virus some years ago. The management of these unforeseen occurrences comes with huge responsibilities and financial commitments on the part of the state government.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu commended the chairman and members of RMAFC for taking the bold step of reviewing the revenue allocation method, which he believed would, \u201cresult in a fundamental alteration of the current revenue sharing formula, in favour of one that is truly fair and equitable, and that takes into full consideration the specific and more pragmatic fiscal contexts of the sub-national governments of the federation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army authorities have mandated soldiers travelling to go home to see their families to buy N6000 torches for the service as one of the conditions for leaving, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSome of the affected soldiers told SaharaReporters that the practice was rife in 195 Battalion in Maiduguri, Borno State, where personnel seeking to travel to see their relations are made to purchase torches which are supposed to be provided by the military.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that only those personnel who purchased the item among other conditions were allowed to go and see their families.\n\n\u201cIn 195 Battalion, Maiduguri, they force soldiers to buy torches before they are allowed to go home and see their family.

          "text": "Mohammed Bello-Koko, acting managing director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), reportedly owns properties in the United Kingdom which he acquired by secretly running offshore businesses in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was revealed in the Pandora Papers project led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), and which Premium Times is a part of.\n\nIn the course of the project, leaked documents were retrieved from 14 offshore service firms around the world.\n\nBello-Koko was appointed as acting MD of NPA following the suspension of Hadiza Bala-Usman reportedly over her disagreement with Rotimi Amaechi, transportation minister earlier in the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Premium Times, the leaked documents revealed that Bello-Koko and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n; Cordero; Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to secretly register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens in 2008. Both companies were registered the same day \u2014 June 19, 2008.\n\nThe regulators in the BVI also had his companies under watch for suspected money laundering \u2014 a problem Alcogal reportedly helped him tackle with some misinformation provided to the regulators.\n\nUsing the two companies, Coulwood Limited and Marney Limited, tucked away offshore, Bello-Koko was said to have anonymously acquired five London properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newspaper said four of the properties were acquired between 2009 and 2012, and that Bello-Koko potentially exploited UK tax loopholes that allowed the owning of UK properties using so-called envelope structure, that is, anonymously owning properties through offshore companies.\n\n\u201dFor instance, up to 2012 when George Osborne, former UK finance minister, declared new rules, owning property via an offshore company meant that ownership could be transferred by selling the company\u2019s shares rather than the property itself, and in doing so, no UK property sale tax or capital gains tax will be paid,\u201d it said.\n\nBefore joining the civil service, Bello-Koko was a banker with the responsibility for managing accounts of energy firms at the defunct FSB International Bank and later Zenith Bank, where he managed Rivers state government accounts in Nigeria\u2019s oil-abundant Niger Delta region.\n\nAlthough shell companies have been a key feature in illicit financial flow and are used to facilitate drug deals and terrorism financing, owning one is not necessarily illegal and can be for legitimate purposes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo as at the time he acquired the shell companies and the first four UK properties, he was still in the private sector and therefore did not violate Nigerian law.\n\nBut one of the properties was said to have been acquired in May 2017, after Bello-Koko took up an appointment at the NPA. He was appointed executive director for finance and administration in 2016 and later acting MD in 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, Bello-Koko first used Marney Limited to acquire Flat 2, Liberty Court, 141, Great North Way, London NW4 1PR with an FBN UK mortgage, on October 20, 2009, and, then on July 23, 2012, 62, Manton Road, Enfield, London EN3 6XZ mortgage-free (with cash). Both properties cost 275,000 pounds and 280,000 pounds, respectively, when they were acquired.\n\nUsing the second company, Coulwood Limited, Bello-Koko also reportedly bought three other London properties, namely 62 Corner Mead, Hendon, (NW9 5RD) on November 25, 2008; 37 Redlands Road, Enfield (EN3 5HN) on August 16, 2011; and 14, Faraday House, Aurora Gardens, London (SW11 8ED) on May 3, 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe allegedly paid 205,000 pounds for the 2011 Enfield property, and 235,000 pounds for the 2008 Hendon property which he sold, according to records, in May 2017 for 350,000 pounds.\n\nFor the third, the 2017 Aurora Garden property, he allegedly paid 475,000 pounds, being his largest single investment in the UK property market. This was acquired after his NPA appointment.\n\nAnalysis of the investments shows that between 2008 and 2012, he had allegedly spent on four London properties a sum of 995,000 pounds, an equivalent of 293 million Naira at the 2015 exchange rate of 294 Naira to a pound.\n\nAgain, none of these properties was said to have been acquired in his name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBello-Koko\u2019s companies, Marney Limited and Coulwood Limited, were among nine companies apparently placed under watch by the Financial Investigation Agency (FIA), the regulator in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nOn January 20, 2017, FIA sought information about the affected companies owned by Nigerians, Panamanians, and Russians from their registered agent, Alcogal, documents showed.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, the pieces of information requested by FIA, including identities of the beneficial owners, directors, and shareholders with their passports and permanent residence information, were sent via a letter signed by Alcogal\u2019s money laundering reporting officer, Blondell Challenger.\n\nOf all the nine companies, only Marney and Couldwood have the same persons \u2013 Bello-Koko and his wife Agatha \u2013 as directors, shareholders, and ultimate beneficial owners, Alcogal was said to have told FIA.\n\nAlcogal then told FIA that the nine companies \u201cdo not have any bank accounts or assets held in their name\u201d.\n\nIn a March 30, 2017 correspondence, Alcogal sent \u201cupdated KYC (Know Your Customer) documents\u201d for Coulwood and Marney, attaching Bello-Koko\u2019s Nigerian passport information page and reference letter from the First Bank (UK) Limited.\n\nThe First Bank\u2019s letter dated March 27, 2017, and addressed to Alcogal described Bello-Koko and his wife as \u201cvalued client of our Bank since 2010\u201d and added that \u201cthey have always demonstrated a high degree of integrity and capability\u201d. The bank mentioned the couple\u2019s Port-Harcourt-Nigeria address. But there was no mention of his public service role.\n\nWhen contacted, Bello-Koko did not respond to any of the allegations.",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s Crypto Explorer , a monthly series featuring in-depth analysis on the crypto sector in Africa. Expect topics on innovation, regulation, financial inclusion, remittance, eCommerce, and more. for email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, due to reasons ranging from a clash with Independence Day activities to the ill-preparedness of commercial banks, the much-anticipated launch was postponed\n\nWhile addressing the postponement, CBN\u2019s Director of Communications, Osita Nwasinobi, again recited some benefits of the eNaira \u2014 peer-to-peer transactions, reduction of cash use, and financial inclusion.\n\nWhile the eNaira has its benefits, concerns have been pointed out regarding transparency and how it could aid illegal financial practices by those in control.\n\nAccording to a Twitter user, a closed or private ledger means crucial information such as supply rate, burn rate, and every eNaira transaction will be known to and controlled solely by an entity \u2014 trusted intermediary \u2014 that has access to the blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBN said it's expensive to print Naira and E-naira will reduce this cost because they will print Naira electronically. You already know they are dabbling into an area they don't know. No Open Ledger, we can't see current supply/ burn rate so it's laundering on steroids. Goodluck \u2014 $AYOBAMI \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb (@dondekojo) September 21, 2021\n\nWhile we\u2019ve explored how this currency will work, what it means, and how it differs from other digital currencies, we\u2019re yet to examine the possibilities of a closed or private blockchain aiding \u201claundering on steroids\u201d\n\nWhat is a private blockchain?\n\nA private blockchain is accessible and controlled by a single entity, organisation, or enterprise. The Hyperledger Fabric, chosen to run the eNaira by the CBN, is an example of a private blockchain.\n\nThey\u2019re also known as permissioned blockchains. A trusted intermediary can choose to grant full or partial access to another entity if it deems fit.\n\nBitcoin made blockchain technology famous, so like the cryptocurrency, the tech is associated with decentralisation and openness. But private blockchains are the opposite. Although it\u2019s the same tech, there\u2019s no form of decentralisation; a single entity controls everything.\n\nBlockchain is a database or a record book, if you like, that stores data. It is a distributed ledger that stores transactions that have been validated on a blockchain network.\n\nValidated transactions are aggregated and stored in a block; this block is added to previous blocks creating a chain, hence the word blockchain.\n\nIn the case of private blockchains, the process of validating transactions that leads to the creation of blocks is decided by one entity, bearing similarity with an original banking system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about public blockchains?\n\nPublic blockchains, like the name implies, are open to everyone. Anyone can join the network and see transactions that have taken place. For example, by simply typing https://www.blockchain.com/explorer on your browser, you can search for a Bitcoin address, see the number of Bitcoins in it, and the transactions it has performed.\n\nAlso, anyone with the proper hardware can validate transactions on a public blockchain. While it\u2019s open to the public, it is secure and offers a lot of transparency.\n\nHow private blockchains work, compared to the public ones\n\nImmediately, the difference between a private and public blockchain is clear \u2014 control and access. However, to get an idea of how much power a trusted intermediary \u2014 in this case, CBN \u2014 has on a private blockchain, it is important to break down the transaction process.\n\nAccording to an explanation by Bird & Bird, a global law firm, a trusted intermediary controls a private blockchain.\n\nThis means the CBN will have total control. A trusted intermediary can either build the entire blockchain software from scratch or licence it from a third party like the Hyperledger Fabric, as the apex bank did.\n\nThe private blockchain network is set up using nodes that run this software. A node is simply a system that validates transactions in a blockchain network.\n\nThe CBN will run the validator nodes itself or use a subsidiary \u2014 most likely BItt Inc. It will also create an app with which users \u2014 Nigerians \u2014 can interface with these nodes. Once you carry out a transaction on the app, it is relayed to the CBN who validates them.\n\nAlso, there are two major ways to set up a private blockchain:\n\ndistributed ledger model, and\n\nshared ledger model.\n\nFrom the presentation by the CBN containing the role of strategic stakeholders in the eNaira launch, it can be inferred that the regulator will most likely use the shared ledger model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of eNaira presentation\n\nIn the presentation, banks, fintechs, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS), and other stakeholders will be playing major roles in the deployment of the eNaira, a setup that fits the shared ledger model.\n\nUsing this model, the CBN has the master node and a full copy of the ledger. We then have the first layer of participants \u2014 banks or fintechs \u2014 that run nodes but only have a partial copy of the ledger and have their information limited to the apex bank\u2019s control.\n\nThe third layer of participants is the app users.\n\nIn contrast, a public blockchain does not have a trusted intermediary. There\u2019s a network of equal nodes that interact with each other.\n\nPer Bird & Bird, \u201cthese nodes are responsible for verifying and relaying the transactions on the blockchain network, but they can also act as end-user software that allows a user to create transactions and/or mine/verify transactions before they are added to the blockchain.\u201d\n\nUsing Bitcoin as an example, the transaction starts from a wallet broadcasted to the network where the digital signatures are verified.\n\nThe mining nodes then try to validate the transaction using something called a consensus algorithm \u2014 a rule written into the blockchain software that makes certain transactions are validated correctly. The whole process is known as proof of work (PoW).\n\nA private blockchain goes through somewhat the same process, but instead of a network of nodes deciding the fate of the transaction, it is done by one entity.\n\nHow much power does a private blockchain give the CBN\n\nAdedayo Adebajo, Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the blockchain company behind Ardor, an open-source blockchain network, believes that while blockchain is immutable, in the case of a private blockchain, the owners can doctor information on it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running a private blockchain, there are a number of things you need to sacrifice, part of which is transparency.\n\n\u201cSome of the reasons people run a private blockchain is to remove the need for transparency, to be able to scale, increase transaction speed with reduced energy consumption, and reduce the need for numerous gadgets in terms of nodes.\u201d\n\nHe says it bears a lot of resemblance with the kind of banking operations we have today, the difference being that the currency is digital and could in the future be deployed for decentralised applications where smart contracts will come into play.\n\nInterestingly, he points out that manipulation of information is possible on a private blockchain.\n\n\u201cIt becomes pretty much easy for people to manipulate data and go away with it for a while before it can be discovered or detected as the nodes continue to generate.\u201d\n\nAdebajo believes that a public blockchain would be more suitable for creating the eNaira, making information available to many people.\n\nThis corroborates @dondekojo\u2019s tweet that burn rates or circulation rates will be unknown.\n\nBurning in this sense is reducing the amount of a particular currency in circulation to control inflation. If a certain amount of eNaira were to be burned, it would be almost impossible to confirm if it was indeed burned or laundered.\n\nWould a public blockchain be better?\n\nWhile launching the eNaira on the public blockchain could provide more transparency, it also has limitations.\n\nTo maintain security, public blockchains such as Bitcoin run thousands of nodes which makes transactions very slow.\n\nIf this is applied to the eNaira, transactions will take minutes to several hours to complete.\n\nAlso, running a validator node on the Bitcoin network is expensive. It requires significantly powerful computing hardware, one of which costs between $5000 and $10,000. It\u2019s important to note that thousands of these will be needed to run a secure network.\n\nWhile it can be argued that there are faster public blockchains with a less expensive consensus mechanism such as proof of stake (PoS), their security and true decentralisation isn\u2019t as assured as Bitcoin\u2019s model.\n\nFlowing from this, is transparency a valid price to pay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello.\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nBuilding Patricia after failing in 13 businesses\n\niWello\u2019s healthcare service for \u20a6300 ($0.76)\n\nAfrican teachers and educational technology\n\nAirtel Money\u2019s partnership with Flutterwave\n\nBuilding Patricia after failing in 13 businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerseverance is one of the qualities of successful business owners. Although it takes time for a business to thrive, this usually depends on keeping your eyes on the goal regardless of obstacles.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2, had a chat with Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, CEO of Patricia \u2014 an alternative payment solutions platform \u2014 about his failure in 13 other businesses before Patricia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this insightful discussion, Agbodje reveals how his failed business experiences later paid off.\n\nInterestingly, he just wanted to make \u20a630,000 ($84*) monthly, so in 2017, Agbodje started the company as a gift card exchange platform before evolving into a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOne of the things that struck me was that he kept a journal where he jotted down all his ideas. For me, that\u2019s pretty inspiring because in the past, I\u2019ve had some brilliant ideas, but I never remembered them because I didn\u2019t write them down.\n\nAs a neurodivergent person, this is something I want to start doing because I get easily distracted, forget things quickly, and rarely have light bulb moments just by thinking. So, once I\u2019ve forgotten an idea, it\u2019s difficult to recall the concept again.\n\nMoreso, despite having no technical background and being unaware of the existence of a tech community that could assist his business, Agbodje\u2019s 13 failed business experiences paid off immensely.\n\nDo you want to know how? Please, read this: From \u2018urgent\u2019 \u20a630k to $50m: How Hanu Fejiro Abodje built Patricia from scratch\n\nWant a different experience?

And few countries can afford the $34 to $40 per person per year that the World Health Organization (WHO) considers the bare minimum for essential healthcare services.\n\nAlso, per the United Nations (UN), most Africans, primarily the poor and middle-class, rely on underfunded public health facilities. At the same time, a small minority has access to well-funded, high-quality private health care.\n\nIn Nigeria, 83 million people live in poverty as of 2020 and can not afford basic health services.\n\nTo solve this, iWello, a telemedicine startup, is making healthcare available to Nigerians for \u20a6300 ($0.76).\n\nFounded in July 2021 by Ismail Adejonwo, the startup provides healthcare consultation and surgery funding for procedures like appendix removal, caesarean section for pregnant women, and kidney failure issues.\n\nFor context, kindly read: Nigerian telemedicine startup, iWello, is making healthcare available to people living on less than $1 per day\n\nAfrican teachers and educational technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of technology in education can be traced back to 2,500 years ago. And the main goal of incorporating technology into education is to change how teachers and students gather, access, analyse, present, and transmit information.\n\nThis research by the Academy of Finland says that technology transforms the teacher\u2019s role from that of a traditional knowledge provider to that of a facilitator, guiding the students\u2019 learning processes and engaging in joint problem-solving with the students.\n\nAnd around the world, education systems are investing in technology to help teachers be more effective.\n\nBut, given that the edtech industry is still in its early stages in Africa, what does the advancement of educational technology mean for teachers?\n\nJoy and Chimgozirim explained what this means here: What do current edtech innovations mean for teachers in Africa?\n\nAirtel Money partners with Flutterwave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s mobile money platform, Airtel Money, has announced a partnership with African payments company, Flutterwave to expand Airtel Money\u2019s services to business across Eastern Africa.\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? Consequently, businesses in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Kenya, and Rwanda can accept Airtel Money payments and make bulk payments into Airtel Money wallets.\n\nThis partnership was declared just one day after Airtel Africa announced that Olusegun Ogunsanya, former CEO of Airtel Nigeria, has assumed the role of Managing Director and CEO of Airtel Africa on October 1, 2021.\n\nWhy this partnership? Airtel Money believes that as consumer behaviour changes and eCommerce grows, businesses will be increasingly required to accept mobile money payments from customers for goods and services.\n\nIt also claims that larger businesses are discovering that sending large amounts of money to their employees\u2019 or customers\u2019 mobile money wallets is less expensive, faster, and more convenient.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. In September 2021, Flutterwave announced a partnership with MTN Group, Africa\u2019s telecoms company, to enable businesses in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia to accept payments via MTN Mobile Money (MoMo).\n\nOlugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, says, \u201cWe are excited to have partnered with Airtel Money to further advance local businesses payment methods which will allow them to increasingly provide more services to their customers, grow their customer base and revenue.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Lost About $65 Million During Hours-Long Outage.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNelson Mandela believed education is the most potent weapon with which one can change the world.\n\nConsequently, lack of education causes an ordinary, stagnant world, crippled and lacking in the production of human capital and innovations.\n\nWhile discussing education in Africa, one cannot help but notice the challenges that plague the sector, especially at the primary and secondary levels.\n\nIssues like overcrowded classrooms, low number of teachers, obsolete curriculums, poor compensation, and support for teachers stand out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue to the poor conditions of most of the schools, teachers are frustrated and stressed out. A 2020 report on the drivers of teacher absenteeism in sub-Saharan Africa released by the United Nations (UN) revealed that, on average, 15.5% to 17.8% of the 3,498 teachers surveyed reported inability to work due to delayed salaries. This directly contributed to them being absent from work.\n\nThe size of a classroom, the quality of teaching materials, and the number of students matter in helping a teacher carry out their duties effectively.\n\nA United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) report predicted that sub-Saharan Africa will need about 17 million additional teachers to achieve universal primary and secondary school education by 2030 because of a severe shortage of teachers.\n\nData from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) shows that Central Africa has the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Africa at 80:1, with the lowest being 29:1 in Seychelles, compared to South Korea\u2019s 14:1 and Finland\u2019s 11:1.\n\nAway from the problems and given the right conditions, how important is a teacher\u2019s role in education?\n\nRole of teachers in the traditional education process\n\nIn the context of the conventional education process, a teacher\u2019s role goes beyond delivering a set of instructions aimed at impacting knowledge or rules to a group of learners. Teachers can be seen as mentors.\n\nTo get a comprehensive picture of the role of teachers in education, I reached out to Mrs Tina Matthew, an elementary school owner and early childhood educator who was a teacher for over a decade, to get her opinion on the subject. She believes that a teacher\u2019s role goes beyond the board and marker.\n\n\u201cTeachers are the bedrock of every profession. Their influence can determine how excited pupils are about a subject. I would say they can go as far as influencing their students/pupils view of the world. Children/learners/students can go on to find mentors, role models, friends and, in some cases, parent figures in their teachers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is why it is important that they are well paid and compensated, as this acknowledges their immense value and plays a part in inciting excitement about their jobs.\u201d\n\nProviding incentives go a long way in producing well-motivated teachers, students happy and curious about learning.\n\nIn commemoration of World Teachers Day, we look at how technology aids teachers\u2019 jobs and its role in the educational space. We also examine the responses of teachers to the use of tech in their work.\n\nEdtech in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs technology innovations have increased in Africa, the education industry has not been left out. With almost 60% of Africa\u2019s population under the age of 25 and an average literacy rate of 70%, the continent lags behind other parts of the world and is ripe for disruptions in education.\n\nHowever, edtech innovations in Africa are not so straightforward. While there is undoubtedly a huge addressable market, systemic issues make it difficult to progress in the edtech space.\n\nOne such problem is the lack of infrastructure. For edtech solutions to have any meaningful impact, the necessary infrastructure such as broadband connection must be present. This is not the case, however.\n\nBroadband penetration rates differ across different countries. In Nigeria, for example, the federal government has made attempts to aid broadband penetration in the country by waiving payment of right of way (RoW) charges on federal highways. In addition, it has encouraged states to slash these charges as high fees are a significant challenge in extending broadband coverage.\n\nHowever, only a few states have complied, meaning that broadband penetration differs across the country\u2019s 36 states.\n\nAnother critical factor is the purchasing power of consumers. In 2018, Nigeria overtook India to become the \u2018poverty capital of the world.\u2019\n\nThe situation is not different in other parts of Africa. In fact, according to a World Bank publication, except things change, at the rate Africa\u2019s population keeps growing, global poverty will become \u2018increasingly African.\u2019\n\nThe result of this is that while the total addressable market for edtech startups remains vast, the majority of this market cannot afford to buy mobile phones, laptops, or mobile data needed to access these products.\n\nInnovative entrepreneurs have risen to the challenge, providing solutions that are tailor-made to Africa\u2019s unique environment. South African edtech startup, Foondamate, for example, uses WhatsApp APIs to deliver lessons to students.\n\nTo understand why this is necessary, WhatsApp can run on most smartphones, and with most Africans accessing the Internet through mobile devices, the decision to go that route is genius.\n\nAnother startup trying its hand at tackling these challenges is uLesson. The company provides educational content for secondary school students in line with the curriculum in the countries \u2013 like Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia, United States, and United Kingdom \u2013 where they operate. The content is put in a USB dongle which can be played on any device.\n\nRecently, they introduced learning centres \u2014 places students can walk in and use provided devices to access the study materials. While it is still early days, this option could see more students use the startup\u2019s product.\n\nThe focus on building solutions primarily for students without taking into account the role of teachers is another problem that the sector is faced with. In a previous article, we argued that involving teachers in the edtech innovation process would help solve the learning problem in Nigeria.\n\nWhile the article\u2019s focus was on Nigeria, the same can be said for other countries in Africa. Fortunately, some entrepreneurs in the sector agree with that.\n\nBoye Oshinaga, CEO and Co-founder of Gradely, believes that involving teachers in the ideation process is necessary since they have lots of field experience educating children and can give valuable insights.\n\nWhile edtech startups are doing a great job, some of the challenges they face are not issues they can solve themselves.\n\nResponse of teachers to edtech\n\nThe issues raised earlier regarding poverty and infrastructural deficits mean it isn\u2019t easy to gauge how well teachers have responded to edtech innovations.\n\nHowever, our discussions with a few teachers and entrepreneurs in the edtech sector revealed that some teachers have been receptive to the idea of using edtech innovations in their work.\n\nKabir Ogunbanwo, a maths teacher in a private secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria, says technology has helped him do his job better.\n\n\u201cBefore now, only a few teachers have been involved in online teaching in one way or the other. Now, I have been exposed to different online teaching experiences.\u201d\n\nMrs Onabegun Mojisola, a teacher in a secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria, has had a different experience. She agrees that although technology serves as a means of resource and research for her job as a teacher, it has provided nothing else so far.\n\n\u201cAs much as technology aids my job in making research for my notes, right now, in the school where I work, the only thing we have that you can say is technology is the Internet, which helps me in research. As for edtech software, I\u2019m yet to make use of any for my job.\u201d\n\nFor Bunmi Eyiaro, Learning and Development Manager at Tuteria, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology by teachers in different categories: those who were willing to use technology to make their jobs easier and teachers who started using technology reluctantly, perhaps because they had to use it.\n\nHowever, she also conceded that there was some pushback from teachers due to not knowing how using technology in their processes would work.\n\nGoing by this, we could make the argument that while teachers might initially resist any attempt to move away from the traditional methods they are used to, with adequate instruction, they could be amenable to incorporating technology in their processes.\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly enormous challenges that could prevent edtech startups from gaining ground in Africa, the truth remains that there is a massive opportunity for entrepreneurs willing to build solutions in the sector while providing teachers with the tools to improve their work.\n\nAs we pointed out earlier, the work teachers do go beyond instruction. Therefore, the chances of teachers being replaced by technology are slim. Instead, used correctly, technology could help them to increase productivity.\n\nHappy World Teachers Day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "In the last six years, the federal government of Nigeria\u2019s spend on infrastructure which is also part of its economic growth and recovery plan (EGRP) has yielded 13,000 kilometres of roads nationwide, Babatunde Fashola, Minister for Works and Housing, has disclosed.\n\nFashola, who spoke at \u2018An Evening with the Minister of Works and Housing\u2019 hosted by the Lagos Business School recently, explained however that the roads were still under various levels of construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, etc, citing Bodo-Borno Bridge, Second Niger Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano expressway among others.\n\nHe assured that all these road projects would be completed within the life of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, noting that a generation of Nigerians now travel by rail through the Lagos-Ibadan railway and the Abuja-Kaduna railway, both commssioned by the administration.\n\nThe minister, who was apparently defending an administration whose public perception is general non-performance across sectors, insisted that though people might not like what they do or believe what they say, they could not, in all honesty, disbelieve what they have done in the area of infrastructure.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s broadband penetration rise by 1.21 percent in August\n\n\u201cWe believe that building infrastructure helps the economy to be productive; it also makes businesses to be efficient and competitive and the more efficient and competitive and efficient they are, the more they need manpower,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe explained why the present government has chosen to borrow extensively as they have, especially in the last couple of years which has raised eyebrow among Nigerians and their friends. \u201cThe only alternative to borrowing is raising taxation and yet that will do nothing,\u201d Fashola reasoned.\n\nFrom a national debt stock of $63bn, out of which $10.3bn were external loans in 2015, the Debt Management Office (DMO) says Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock is N33, 107 trillion which is about $87.239 billion dollars) as at March 31, 2021. At the present exchange rate, the debt stock could be more.\n\nBut the minister said that the government was borrowing because it believes that borrowing to build infrastructure helps the country to become a better and competitive economy, adding that what limits or enhances business growth is the infrastructure or environment in which it operates.\n\n\u201cFor us, enabling the private sector for optimum operation means providing the necessary infrastructure,\u201d the minister noted, stressing that the only way to achieve inclusiveness, sustainability and development was to build infrastructure.\n\nResponding, Suleiman Ndanusa, a Senior Visiting Fellow at Lagos Business School, agreed with the minister on the importance of infrastructure to business and economy, pointing out, however, that lack of funds has made infrastructure to be in deficit.\n\nHe agreed further that the present administration has done well in providing infrastructure, but they could have done better if, according to him, the administration had courted the private sector from the onset.\n\nNigeria lacks good roads. The country has the largest road network in West Africa and second largest in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Its total road network is estimated at 200,000 kilometres. About 2,627 kilometres are said to be dualised while only 35 percent of the entire network is motorable.\n\nThis means that the country\u2019s road infrastructure is in dire situation, needing a large chunk of investment to fix. A glimpse into the country\u2019s infrastructure master-plan gives a better understanding of the situation.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Infrastructure Implementation Master Plan (NIIMP), the value of the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit is $3 trillion, requiring about N100 billion annual investment for the next 30 years to bridge.\n\nA recent report on global infrastructure problem puts it more succinctly. Globally, the report says, the infrastructure gap by 2040 is estimated at $15 trillion with Nigeria\u2019s share of that put at \u20a63 trillion.\n\nIt says that raising funds continues to be at the forefront of the national discourse. The National Pension Commission (PENCOM) has directed that Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) invest a minimum of 60 peercent of their infrastructure funds in projects within Nigeria. This is yet to happen.\n\nThe importance of roads infrastructure can hardly be over-emphasised. Apart from opening up communities, linking cities and facilitating trade and commerce, roads encourage and enable real estate investment. It reduces cost of construction and, by extension, house prices.",

          "text": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has written to lawmakers seeking a 17.67 percent increase of the Federal Government\u2019s projected expenditure in 2022 to N16.45 trillion from N13.98 trillion.\n\nThe projected increase in expenditure equates to N2.47 trillion additional spending, which Buhari said was partly due to the N100 billion extra provision to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cater for 2023 General Elections.\n\nPresident Buhari made the demand in a submission of the Revised 2022-2024 Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), accompanied by a letter read by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila at plenary on Tuesday.\n\nThe increase in expenditure was accompanied by a 21 percent rise in projected revenues to N10.13 trillion. Analysts had said the initial revenue projection of N8.36 trillion was over ambitious based on previous revenue trend where Nigeria has only managed about 50 percent of budgeted revenues.\n\nThe increase in projected revenues leaves the door open to an even higher than planned fiscal deficit despite Buhari\u2019s projection that the deficit will increase by N692.0 billion, representing 3.42% of GDP from 3.05% of GDP in the initial fiscal deficit estimate of N5.62 trillion.\n\nAccording to the President, the increase in expenditure is also due to the provision of N54 billion to the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, which represents 1% Federal Government Share of Federation Account.\n\nRead also: Lack of central vaccine database puts Nigeria on UK\u2019s blacklist\n\nThe letter identified other reasons for the increase as: \u201cadditional provision of N510 billion in the Service Wide Votes to cater for National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (N300 billion), Police Operations Fund (N50 billion), Hazard Allowance for Health Workers (N50 billion), Public Service Wage Adjustments (additional N80 billion), and MDAs\u2019 Electricity Bills Debt (additional N37 billion)\u201d.\n\nThe rise is also due to additional capital provision of N1.70 trillion, attributed to projected increases in: \u201cCapital Supplementation by N179.1 billion; GOES Capital by N222.1 billion; TETFUND Expenditure by N290.7 billion; Multilateral / Bilateral Project-tied Loans by N517.5 billion; and, MDAs Capital Expenditure by N390.5 billion (including N178.1 billion provision for population and housing census to be carried out in 2022)\u201d.\n\nBuhari stated that it was necessary to revise the MTEF to reflect the new fiscal terms in the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, as well as other critical expenditures in the 2022 Budget.\n\nHe however indicated that the underlying drivers of the 2022 fiscal projections, such as oil price benchmark, oil production volume, exchange rate, GDP growth, and inflation rate reflect emergent realities and the macroeconomic outlook, and remain unchanged as in the previously approved 2022-24 MTEF & FSP.\n\nThe changes to the 2022 projections in the Fiscal Framework demanded by the President include; gross revenue projection decreased by N341.57 billion, from N8.870 trillion to N8.528 trillion; deductions for Federally-funded upstream project costs and 13% derivation, decreased by N335.3 billion and N810.25 million respectively and net Oil and Gas revenue projection declined by N5.42 billion from N6.540 trillion to N6.535 trillion.\n\nOther proposed amendments include; a projected decline in Net Oil and Gas Revenue by N5.42 billion; an increase in projected FGN\u2019s Retained Revenue from N8.36 trillion to N10.13 trillion (inclusive of GOES).\n\nThis is largely based on:\u201dprojected increase in the revenues of Government Owned Enterprises (GOES) by N837. 76 billion; MDAs internally Generated Revenue by N697.6 billion.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of Education Tax of N306 billion and Dividend of N8.3 billion from the Bank of Industry as revenue lines; and FGN share of oil price royalty of N969 billion which is expected to be transferred to the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority based on the provisions of the PIA\u201d.",

It is about our people. The first thing any good government will do for its people is to give them a good quality education.\n\n\u201cAt the core of our educational system is the teacher. We proved it with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme. If the teachers do not accept it, we won\u2019t have the type of transformation now visible in our educational sector.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cWe need you to keep helping us drive this process. That is why I am here to demand more from you; I have no doubt that you will respond.\n\n\u201cToday, we are not talking about teachers\u2019 promotion again. Now, we are working on those who didn\u2019t get a promotion even before we came into office. If we were able to promote people since 2016, it means that we believe in it. We have to sit down and review the matter of those who were affected from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\u201cFor those teachers who retired in August 2021, it is only fair that they are paid their full salary. After reviewing all your requests, I believe there is nothing difficult there that we cannot do. This is how I want our relationship to be. Your lives mean a lot to us. Now, there is trouble in Nigeria, we need to come together to help save this country.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWith the issue of insecurity in some parts of the country, security in our schools has to be our number one priority. We need to have our schools safe for learning. The other issue is your health during this period of COVID-19 pandemic. I urge you to obey all the guidelines, get vaccinated as I am not making vaccination compulsory.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we respect seniority in appointing heads and it must be earned. We will continue to do the right thing. I can assure you that as governor, we will not persecute anybody.

Additionally, just 19 out of 54 African countries offer financial support to filmmakers.\n\nThe report outlined limitations on freedom of expression, education, training and internet connectivity as further challenges plaguing the industry.\n\nThis year marks two decades since adopting a UNESCO Declaration that upholds cultural diversity as being as necessary to humanity as biodiversity is to nature.\n\nMs Azoulay said in commemorating the anniversary, \u201cWe must raise our voice to reaffirm that films are indeed \u2018public goods\u2019 that require public support and investment to ensure equal access to creation, production, distribution, dissemination and consumption.\u201d",

South-East governors have no stand to stop it.\n\n\u201cIPOB can only stop sit-at-home because they initiated it.

We still stand on no more Monday sit-at-home and anybody enforcing it is not IPOB. They will get their reward soon; our people should stop Monday sit-at-home because IPOB has stopped it openly, and we are not going back on that.

          "text": "Ivan Sheehan, Executive Director of the University of Baltimore\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs, believes the US government to classify the Indigenous People of Biafra, or IPOB, a terrorist organization.\n\nThe American don gave reasons it is necessary for Biden\u2019s government to designate IPOB as a terrorist group.\n\nHe said the establishment of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) by IPOB signalled the end of the group\u2019s \u201cpretences of being a peaceful movement\u201d.\n\nSheehan accused IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu of supporting terrorism and issuing threats via Radio Biafra.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu, IPOB\u2019s leader, is clearly unconcerned. That he feels no need to even disguise his support of terrorism is worrisome. Though IPOB\u2019s principal aim is to restore a breakaway state of Biafra in the southeastern parts of Nigeria, Mr. Kanu\u2019s rhetoric has become increasingly strident, \u201cI don\u2019t want peaceful actualisation (of Biafra).\n\n\u201cMr. Kanu has said through his Radio Biafra channel, used to project threats, instructions, and propaganda into Nigeria from the safety of London, \u201cIf they don\u2019t (give us Biafra), they will die.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither does Mr. Kanu make idle threats. The December revelation of IPOB\u2019s 50,000 strong-armed paramilitary wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), complete with a Swastika-style flag, marked the end to all pretences of being a peaceful movement.\n\n\u201cWhat had been largely unspoken was publicly declared. Since then, violent IPOB attacks on both security personnel and civilians have surged by a terrifying 59%; deaths by 344%,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSheeran further explained that if the secessionist group is tagged with a terror label, it would be difficult for any organisation using the US currency to carry out legal transactions with IPOB adding that such declaration would \u201chit IPOB\u2019s wallet hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as the designation is applied, no organisation that utilises U.S. currency would be able to legally conduct transactions with the organisation. By cutting off IPOB\u2019s funding, the U.S. would weaken the 50,000 strong paramilitary outfit, and provide Nigeria\u2019s security forces room to train their sights squarely on ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram in the Northeast of the country.\n\n\u201cCounterterrorism operations against Boko Haram have long been assisted by U.S. agencies working in close coordination with the West African government,\u201d he added.\n\nRecall that in 2017, the Federal Government declared IPOB a terrorist group.\n\nIPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu was however, subsequently arrested in Kenya in June, 2021, and presently detained in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS).",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: PDP under pressure to reverse govs\u2019 zoning arrangement",
          "text": "Ahead of Thursday\u2019s National Executive Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), members and leaders of the main opposition party are mounting pressure on the leadership to reject the zoning arrangement as proposed by the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led committee.\n\nMajority of the PDP governors had voted in favour of zoning national chairman of the party to the North, a development that may have shut out the northern zone from contesting the nation\u2019s presidency.\n\nGroup explains\n\nRejecting the proposal Tuesday in Abuja through a statement by its convener, Reverend Olusola Salau, the PDP National Leaders Forum, called on the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) that is meeting Thursday to jettison what it described as the \u201cself-serving proposal and maintain the status quo.\u201d\n\nThe PDP chieftain said the composition of the Zoning Committee of the party was faulty for the reason that it was lopsided and deliberately skewed to satisfy the interest of a section of the party.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Benue State has five representatives while Osun has no single representative. Even when that observation was raised at the meeting, a certain Governor from the South- South bullied everybody to ignore something as fundamental as that,\u201d Salau said.\n\nThe statement also alleged that some members of the committee used the opportunity of being members of the committee to serve their political interest at the detriment of the party.\n\nThe group said: \u201cWe have it on good authority that one member of the committee who is a Governor in a South-South state was busy offering monetary inducements to sway other members from toeing the logical path. We know who this Governor is and we are aware that he is nursing a presidential ambition. We do not have any objection to his ambition. However, we will not accept a process that will make anyone fetch the presidential ticket of our great party through a manipulative process.\u201d\n\nAlso, the group described the procedure by which the zoning committee rendered its report as \u201cobnoxious and not known to the established pattern of how similar previous reports are presented in the party.\n\n\u201cThe report is self-serving, ridiculous and embarrassing because the PDP NEC empowered and mandated the committee to recommend zoning of party offices. The normal practice is that the report must first be laid before the NEC for consideration and the party will then approve and announce final ratification just like the Governor Bala-led fact finding committee on the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIts report was laid before the NEC and approved. But in this case, the Governors and zoning committee acted in bad faith and if care is not taken the party will pay dearly for it in 2023.\u201d\n\nAnother area of objection which the group cited bordered on the current zoning arrangement in the PDP which stipulates that the national chairman\u2019s position is supposed to remain in the South.\n\nTherefore, \u201cmust we punish the South alongside the outgoing chairman? Why is the committee in a hurry to throw away the baby with the bath water? For the avoidance of doubt there have been two zoning arrangements in the history of the PDP: one in 2007 and the other in 2017 which was to lapse in 2025. This arrangement gave the south the privilege to produce the national chairmanship of the party till 2025.\n\n\u201cIf there were to be any zoning, it should be amongst the three zones of the South and, in that case, the Southwest that has never attained the position of the PDP National Chairman is more deserving of the position. This is even more so that the next two governorship elections before the 2023 general election will be in Osun and Ekiti. Thus, what will the PDP take to the Southwest to enable the zone to give our party a deserving victory in those two crucial elections?\n\nLastly and more importantly, the group said: \u201cThe PDP has a pedigree of being the only political party in Nigeria that comes to intervene when the country is at a boiling point as it is today. Be it at the time that the country was transitioning from military junta to civilian rule or when the country was burdened with a leadership vacuum that necessitated the doctrine of necessity, the PDP has always been the party that steers the country off the cliffs.\n\n\u201cThis time around, Nigeria needs the PDP to come to its rescue once again. Our party needs to put someone with capacity and experience forward to do this job \u2013 not some characters that can\u2019t even put the national interest ahead of their political ambition in a simple party assignment.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Nigeria has never been this divided and broken and it is expedient on the principle of natural priority that another person from the North, who is more qualified and experienced should be our party\u2019s candidate for the job to get Nigeria fixed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the responsibility of the PDP to toe the line of ethic divisiveness that our main opponents are known for. Ours is a party built on principles and mutual respect for all shades of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that we humbly demand that the National Executive Committee of our great party reject in its entirety the submissions of the zoning committee. Zoning arrangement is a responsibility of the highest decision making organ of the party, not some self-serving governors and their cohorts.\u201d\n\nNorthern youth kick\n\nIn a related development, the Northwest youth wing of the PDP is also against the party\u2019s decision on zoning.\n\nAccording to the PDP youth, the North is yet to complete its term of presidency under PDP as former President Goodluck Jonathan completed late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s tenure and went ahead to run his own first term at the expense of the North.\n\nTo this end, they said the North must complete its outstanding terms of office, vowing not to accept anything less in 2023.\n\nCoordinator of the PDP National Youth Wing, Northwest Zone, Hon. Ibrahim Ahmadu, made the position known Tuesday in a statement in Kaduna.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe recent meeting held by southern governors and the demand that the next president should come from the south would be met with stiff resistance and vehemently rejected.\n\n\u201cWe are going to fight it should the southern governors insist on zoning presidency to the south. Democracy is about equal representation with concerns for equity, justice and fairness, Where is the fairness if after 13 years of reign in the presidency, southerners are still demanding for presidential ticket come 2023?\n\n\u201cSoutherners have enjoyed 13 out of the 16 years PDP has ruled this country. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo ruled for two terms of office (8 years), former President Goodluck Jonathan ruled for a term of 4 years and completed Late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s remaining one year in office (5 years). Altogether power resided in the south for 13 years out of the 16 years PDP reigned in power.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of PDP stipulates two terms for any political office holder, but late Yar\u2019Adua only spent three year and died while in office.\u201d\n\nThe PDP youth wing further said it would work and mobilise party members across the North to stop the passage of resolutions at the national convention scheduled for October 30th and 31st in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe are battle ready to fight this injustice and insensitive decision and resolutions in the interest of progress and justice.\n\n\u201cPDP is known for grassroots governance and fair democratic decision and these positions we are willing to maintain ahead of the 2023 general elections. We are calling on all party members to rise up now and say \u201cNo to zoning presidency to the South again.\u201d Northerners especially should come together and speak with one voice,\u201d the northern youth further warned.\n\n",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nChairman of the South-East Governors Forum David Umahi has decried the degeneration of what started as a cry against marginalisation into violence in the region.\n\nUmahi, who is also the Governor of Ebonyi State, said this when he appeared on Channels TV\u2019s breakfast show Sunrise Daily on Wednesday.\n\nThe governor was speaking about the security situation in the South-East, the activities of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other issues, a day after governors of the region announced that a security outfit \u201cEbube Agu\u201d will be established in the five states that make up the region before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cAt the initial time, it was an issue of \u2018look, we are being marginalised. A lot of people keyed into that,\u201d Governor Umahi said of the initial agitations in the region.\n\n\u201cThen, along the line, it developed into violence. And then later, the same agitation has been hijacked by criminals, bandits and kidnappers.\u201d\n\nTaking Advantage\n\nThe Governor explained that the grievances of people in the region over the years had led to support for IPOB, which had said it was fighting against the marginalisation of the region.\u201cA lot of people keyed in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf anybody had grievances with the centre (Federal Government), the person became a supporter of IPOB. If you sort anything at the federal level and you fail to get it, you become a supporter of IPOB.\n\nThose in the diaspora that went for greener pastures and they failed to get such become very bitter with the Nigerian society. And so, followers kept growing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, the situation worsened when the conflicts with herdsmen came up.\n\n\u201cThey were a couple of killings in the South-East and the people were a bit helpless and felt the governors were not protecting them,\u201d he said, adding that though the governors did a lot to ensure that there was peace between the herders and people, residents were not satisfied.\n\n\u201cYou see, some uninformed elements felt that the only way to solve the problem between us and herdsmen was to ask them to leave the South-East.\u201d\n\nThe preferred option for these elements, he explained, was not nationalistic because people from the South-East also live in the north.\n\n\u201cThen came the IPOB with ESN (Eastern Security Network), which is the militant aspect of IPOB, and they started to issue orders of threats,\u201d the governor said.\n\nSo, along the line, the whole exercise has been hijacked. In the South-East, we no longer have kidnappers; everyone that commits one criminal act or the other claims to be IPOB.\u201d\n\nGovernor Umahi accused some politicians, who he did not name, of capitalising on the situation.\n\nThese politicians, he said, \u201cbegan to import killers from outside the South-East to advance their political interests\u201d.\n\nThe governor, however, stressed that the people were beginning to understand the situation and support for IPOB is declining due to the actions of the group and the level of violence in the region.\n\nHe added that once the issues of leadership and development that led to cries of marginalisation were addressed to complement efforts being made by the governors to tackle the situation, security will improve in the region.",

          "text": "Germany\u2019s Benjamin List and David MacMillan of the United States on Wednesday won the Nobel Chemistry Prize for their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction which has helped make chemistry greener, the jury said.\n\nThe duo was awarded \u201cfor their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. This has had a great impact on pharmaceutical research, and has made chemistry greener,\u201d the Nobel Committee said.\n\nPrior to their work, scientists believed there were only two types of catalysts, metals and enzymes.\n\nIn 2000, the researchers, working independently of each other, developed a third type, called \u201casymmetric organocatalysis\u201d, which relies on small organic molecules.\n\nList and MacMillan, both 53, will share the 10-million-kronor ($1.1-million, one-million-euro) prize.\n\n\u201cI thought somebody was making a joke. I was sitting at breakfast with my wife,\u201d List told reporters by telephone during a press conference after the prize was announced.\n\nHe added that usually when the prize is announced, his wife jokes that he should keep an eye on his phone for a call from Sweden.\n\n\u201cBut today we didn\u2019t even make the joke,\u201d List said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe what you feel in that moment but it was a very special moment that I will never forget,\u201d List said.\n\nMacMillan is a professor at Princeton University in the US, while List is a director at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\n\u201cMany research areas and industries are dependent on chemists\u2019 ability to construct molecules that can form elastic and durable materials, store energy in batteries or inhibit the progression of disease,\u201d the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis work requires catalysts, which are substances that control and accelerate chemical reactions, without becoming part of the final product,\u201d it added.\n\nWide-open field\n\nList was the first to prove that the amino acid proline could drive an aldol reaction, which is when carbon atoms from two different molecules are bonded together.\n\n\u201cCompared to both metals and enzymes, proline is a dream tool for chemists. It is a very simple, cheap and environmentally friendly molecule,\u201d the Academy said.\n\nAhead of this year\u2019s announcement, analysts said the field was wide open.\n\nAccording to Clarivate, which maintains a list of potential Nobel Prize winners, more than 70 researchers had what it takes to be considered for the prize in chemistry, given the thousands of citations they have received in scientific papers.\n\nThought to be among the favourites for the medicine prize that was announced on Monday, the pioneers of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, Hungarian biochemist Katalin Kariko and US immunologist Drew Weissman, were also seen as potential candidates for chemistry.\n\nBut many experts also that it is a little too early for the generally cautious Nobel Committees to give the nod.\n\nLast year, the Nobel went to Frenchwoman Emmanuelle Charpentier and American Jennifer Doudna, for developing the gene-editing technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 \u2014 DNA snipping \u201cscissors\u201d.\n\nThe Nobel season continues with the two most closely watched prizes, literature on Thursday and peace on Friday. The winner of the economics prize will be announced on Monday.\n\nThe medicine prize kicked off the 2021 Nobel season on Monday, going to David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for breakthroughs that paved the way for the treatment of chronic pain.\n\nThe physics prize followed Tuesday when half was awarded to US-Japanese scientist Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann for climate models, and the other half to Italy\u2019s Giorgio Parisi for work on the theory of disordered materials and random processes.\n\nAFP",

It is also the king that withdraws titles. This is the tradition. There are several of Ologbotsere children that are chiefs. The Ologbotsere family is very dear to to the monarch.\n\n\u201cThere is no Ologbotsere title again. The head of the Ologbotsere title can answer the nickname. It is the pronouncement of the king and Itsekiri nation. There will be peace, blessings in the land.\n\n\u201cThere is no Ologbotsere again. Nobody should parade in that title. You remember the king dissolved the Council of Chiefs and has been re-admitting and revalidating titles and has also reconstituted the council of Chiefs. Nobody should relate with anyone in the title as Ologbotsere,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ologbotsere descendants at the meeting were, the Head of the family, Pa Jofotan Oporakun; Secretary General of the family, William L. A. Anukun; Mr. Fred Omaghomi, Besidane Esimaje, Omaghomi, Hon O. J. Nana, and Mr Samuel B.O Okorodudu.\n\nSome of the Chiefs also present were the most senior, the Iyatsere and Chairman Warri Council of Chiefs, Chief Johnson Amatserunleghe; Chief Gabriel Awala, Chief BrownMene, Chief Patrick Iralaju, Chief Maleghemi A., Chief Eugene Ikomi and Chief Solomon Arenyeka.\n\nAyiri Emami had been suspended by Prince Emmanuel Okotie-Eboh, as regent before the emergence of Ogiame Atuwatse III, Olu of Warri, over several reasons, which included alleged abuse of the title.\n\nHe assured the people then that the matter would be revisited by a substantive Olu of Warri after his coronation.\n\nBut reacting to his being deposed as Ologbotsere of Warri kingdom, Emami, who spoke to Journalists on phone last night said the Itsekiri monarch has no power to take such action, since he was already challenging the process that produced him as Olu in court.\n\n\u201cHe has no power to do so. I don\u2019t recognise him as Olu of Warri. I\u2019m already in court with him. I\u2019ll take further action to tell the court to stop him from parading himself as Olu. I\u2019m already challenging the processes that produced him but now I am consulting my lawyers to file a new motion stopping him from parading himself as our king,\u201d Ayiri stated.\n\nOn the meeting between the monarch and the Ologbotsere family, the billionaire businessman and politician, said, \u201cHe (Olu of Warri) invited the Ologbotsere family for meeting and my people honoured him where he made the pronouncement.\n\n\u201cHe did not hear from his guests \u2013 Ologbotsere family. The family have (sic) agreed to meet on Thursday to review and take a position on this latest development. The meeting will hold in Warri\u201d, he said.\n\nAyiri, however, appealed to his supporters and the Itsekiri Nation worldwide to remain calm on the latest development.\n\nShortly after the meeting, Ogiame Atuwatse III hosted leaders and members of the Warri chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalist, (NUJ) and urged them to continue to adhere to the ethics of the profession by avoiding temptations to report fake news.\n\nHe commended the journalists and assured them that the palace would sustain the healthy relationship with the NUJ. He later offered royal blessings to the journalists and their various media houses.\n\nChairman of the body, Mr. Victor Okpomo, congratulated the monarch on his ascension to the throne and urged him to partner the body, adding too that the union would always report the activities of the palace accurately, and that the monarch would be decorated as a Life Patron of the body in her coming NUJ week in Warri, Delta State.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",
