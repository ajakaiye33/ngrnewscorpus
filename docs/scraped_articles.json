Among which is that \u201cthe area was constituted as a Forest Reserve for the joint use and benefit of Government and the Native communities owning the land\u201d.\n\n\u201cAbove term is clear and explicit and to Idanre people it is a running covenant in respect of the area.\n\n\u201cTo the dismay of Idanre people the government of Ondo state without regard or deference to the Owa of Idanre and the people has arrogantly given about 50,000 hectares of land in the area to private business owners for 99 years.\n\n\u201cThe following companies are known to be behind the moves to grab Idanre Land. These are Blue Sky Ltd (4000 hectares), Sao Agro services Ltd (10,000 hectares) and Rex (30000 hectares).\n\n\u201cOn Sunday the 17th day of July 2022, SAO Agro services Ltd aided by eight vehicles loaded with personnel of Amotekun security corps and officers of the Nigerian Army invaded Ofosu area with a Bulldozer to begin the destruction of farm lands of over 20,000 farmers who are presently farming on the land.\n\n\u201cIt is our believe that to alienate about over 50,000 hectares of land to private people to the detriment of over 20,000 citizens is immoral and illegal\n\nIdanre people will not watch while the government is giving away the legacies from our forefathers and what should serve the future generation of Idanre away s to few business men.\n\n\u201cThe reality on ground is that the government will not be able to manage the economic and social consequences of this move. Government exits to protect the interest of the people not few opportunists in our midst.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to the Governor to stop this move and protect the image of its government as this is nothing but a move against the people. The so-called ceding of the land of our people to private people is against the spirit of Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. This is an ill wind.\n\nContacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Agric and AgriBusiness, Pastor Akin Olotu, said it will not displace farmers at the Ofosu forest reserve, but would rather integrate them for better yields and improved income.\n\nOlotu added that the state government has \u201cdesigned a programme to bring farmers of same produce together as a cluster as being practiced in developed countries.\n\nAccording to him this \u201cwill be able to meet the disabilities requirement, to get things done in the proper way and make it easier for the extension officers and other agricultural benefits get to them through one road.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The lawmaker representing Idanre Constituency in Ondo Assembly, Hon Festus Akingbaso, on Tuesday, joined farmers in Idanre to protest the alleged acquisition of their farmland by the Ondo State government.\n\nIt was gathered the Ondo State government had keyed into the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) agricultural revolution in cashew and oil palm cultivation by ceding thousands of hectares of farmlands including Idanre forest reserve to private firms\n\nAkingbaso said he joined the protest because 50,000 hectares of land in Idanre have been ceded to private companies for the next 99 years.\n\nAkingbaso, who is the PDP candidate for Idanre/Ifedore federal constituency, said the area known as Idanre Forest Reserve (A05) was submitted to the colonial power under the British indirect rule by an agreement dated 22nd day of September 1918 between Idanre Community and the colonial power represented by the Governor \u2013 General.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe terms of the agreement are explicit. Among which is that \u201cthe area was constituted as a Forest Reserve for the joint use and benefit of Government and the Native communities owning the land.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday, eight vehicles loaded with personnel of Amotekun security corps and officers of the Nigerian Army invaded Ofosu area with a bulldozer to begin the destruction of farm lands of over 20,000 farmers who are presently farming on the land.\n\n\u201cIt is our belief that to alienate about over 50,000 hectares of land to private people to the detriment of over 20,000 citizens is immoral and illegal.\n\nIdanre people will not watch while the government is giving away the legacies from our forefathers and what should serve the future generation of Idanre to few businessmen.\n\n\u201cThe reality on the ground is that the government will not be able to manage the economic and social consequences of this move. Government exist to protect the interest of the people not a few opportunists in our midst.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to the Governor to stop this move and protect the image of its government as this is nothing but a move against the people. The so-called ceding of the land of our people to private people is against the spirit of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999. This is an ill wind.\u201d\n\nSenior Special Assistant to Ondo Governor on Agric and AgriBusiness, Pastor Akin Olotu, said the farmers would not be displaced but integrated for better yields and improved income.\n\nOlotu said the State Government has designed a programme to bring farmers of same produce together as a cluster in line to how it is being practiced in developed countries.\n\nThis, he noted, would be able to meet the disabilities requirement, to get things done in the proper way, and make it easier for the extension officers and other agricultural benefits to get to them.",

          "text": "The campaign organisation of the presidential flag bearer of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO), has insisted the choice of Senator Kashim Shetimma as Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s running mate was in the common interest of all.\n\nThe organisation, in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday by its Director of Media and Communication, Bayo Onanuga, restated that religion or ethnicity was far from the calculations of the APC and Tinubu in picking his running mate.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Tinubu Campaign Organisation has followed the heated debate that the choice of our vice presidential candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima has generated in the country.\n\n\u201cThe TCO restates that religion or ethnicity was far from the calculations of the All Progressives Congress and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in picking his running mate.\n\n\u201cIf Asiwaju intended to cash in on ethnicity, he would have picked a running mate from the North Western part of Nigeria, which has the highest number of registered voters. If he wanted to appeal to the base instincts of religion, he would have also gone for a candidate in the Christian-dominated parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut there was no such consideration. Instead, he picked a tested politician and technocrat from the minority Kanuri ethnic group from the North East.\u201d\n\nTCO maintained that the factors at play were issues germane to confronting the multi-dimensional crisis our nation faces today: insecurity, and economic problems, such as the unemployment crisis facing our youths.\n\n\u201cOur candidate canvassed on his track record in Lagos to win the APC primary last June. As governor between 1999 and 2007, he was able to transform a decadent state into the fourth biggest economy in Africa. He believes that his feat in Lagos can be replicated all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo assist him in realising this vision, he picked Kashim Shettima, who also established a track record of development in Borno State while he was governor for eight years, despite the Boko Haram crisis. Surely, only the deep know how to call onto the deep.\n\n\u201cNigerians have a lot to gain in having the two tested leaders at the helm of affairs.\u201d\n\nThe campaign organisation however regretted that some Nigerians with closet motives have failed to see the opportunities and possibilities the twin candidates present to our country at this time of difficult security, economic and political developments, preferring to fan the embers of religion and ethnic divisions among their unsuspecting and vulnerable compatriots.\n\nIt then appealed to Nigerians to embrace the best elements of our common purpose and reject the campaign and incitement against fellow citizens.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWhen Nigerians stand together, they have been known to achieve incredibly positive outcomes. That is the lesson from our history. To now succumb to the base ends of identity, by further straining our already difficult ethnic and religious cleavages, is a great disservice to the country and to citizens who had no choice about their parentage, ethnicity or religion at birth.\n\n\u201cEither as Christians, Muslims or traditional worshipers, as Nigerians, what should be important to us today and tomorrow is our commonwealth as citizens of this great nation.\u201d\n\nThe TCO recalled that Tinubu had assured Nigerians that he was not oblivious of the religious and ethnic sensitivities of the nation and that he picked Shettima in fulfilment of the overriding interest of the country.\n\nAccording to him: \u201d I am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate. Just and noble people have talked to me about this. Some have counselled that I should select a Christian to please the Christian community. Others said I should pick a Muslim to appeal to the Muslim community. I cannot do both\u201d.\n\n\u201cBoth sides of the debate have impressive reason and passionate arguments supporting their position. Both arguments have good reasons in support of their claims. But the assurances I bring is that as President, I hope to govern this country towards greatness and progress, deploying the tools of modern innovation to resolve seemingly intractable problems that have dogged our country and hindered our match toward greatness. I make this pledge on honoured promise knowing full well that some of the decisions may be politically difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I say this to all of you, especially those disappointed in my selection based on religious considerations. I will not and cannot ignore the religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of our people. I come from a background and orientation of pluralism that understands that the greatest gift contemporary Nigerian leadership needs today is sensitivity to the management of our complex diversity.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has officially unveiled the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd) with a charge that it must ensure that the company\u2019s over 200 million shareholders and Nigerians at large get value in line with global best practices.\n\nHe noted that the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 has given an additional impetus for a transparent and profitable energy venture.\n\nThe president assured that the NNPC Limited will operate as a commercial, independent and viable NOC at par with its peers around the world, to sustainably deliver value to its over 200 million shareholders and the global energy community, while adhering to its fundamental corporate values of integrity, excellence and sustainability.\n\nWith the NNPC transitioned to a fully commercial entity, the federal government will henceforth halt all forms of funding for projects and sundry purposes as against what was obtained in the last 45 years of the national oil company\u2019s existence.\n\nAccording to the president, Nigeria places a high premium on creating the right atmosphere that supports investment and growth to boost its economy and continues to play an important role in sustaining global energy requirements.\n\n\u201cWe are transforming our petroleum industry, to strengthen its capacity and market relevance for the present and future global energy priorities,\u201d the president stated.\n\n\u201cBy chance of history, I was privileged to lead the creation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the 1st July 1977. Forty-Four years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with an improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u201cIt will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorised the transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil company today.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of our National Oil Company from the good to the great.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that NNPC Ltd is mandated by law to ensure Nigeria\u2019s National Energy Security is guaranteed to support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nHe added that the NNPC Ltd will focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice \u201cto deliver energy for today for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva said with the signing of the PIA, which assures international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, the nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless.\n\n\u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for the growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments. In fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 per cent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us,\u201d he said.\n\nSylva described the unveiling of NNPC Ltd as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the president for his unparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support for ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u201cbest human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has directed all churches in Nigeria to advise their members not to vote any presidential candidates with links to hard drugs, Boko Haram or any violent religious groups.\n\nIn a video clip seen by Daily Sun, senior pastor of Family Worship Center, Abuja, Pastor Sarah Omakwu, read out a circular which emanated from the Political and Strategy Committee of CAN and sent to all churches in Nigeria.\n\nIn the circular titled: \u201c2023 General Elections; Whom To Vote For,\u201d CAN enumerated qualities that the presidential candidate must possess and the policies that should either be implemented or rejected.\n\nAmong the qualities CAN said Christians should look out for in a candidate are honesty, truthfulness, respect for the rule of law, respect for religious and ethnic diversity, compassionate, disciplined and credible.\n\nThe body said the candidate must not be a member of any cult, must not have any involvement with drugs, witchcraft, Boko Haram or any violent religious group. The candidate is required to have performed excellently in previous positions, must have good education sufficient to manage a complex society, effective management skills of human and natural resources.\n\nOn policies, CAN said the issue of state police was critical and there must be religious neutrality of the country, enforcement of fundamental rights of all Nigerians, restructuring to decentralise governance and equitable sharing of executive offices.\n\n\u201cOffices must be shared fairly to every section of Nigeria. There must be equal ethnic and religious representation in military and security agencies. We say no to the RUGA settlement policy and yes to ranching. There should be education and free healthcare to all Nigerians including almajiris. We reject open grazing, rather, there should be modernisation of animal husbandry, local control of economy including waters, rivers and forests. Everyone should control what we have.\n\n\u201cThe candidate must not be a member of any cult, must have no involvement in drugs and witchcraft, no fanaticism, no relationship to Boko Haram or other violent religious groups. The person must have quality performance in previous positions, good education sufficient to manage a complex society, effective management of human and natural resources. The person must have the ability to envision transformation, ability to communicate the vision to diverse peoples, ability to effectively effect the vision of transformation, must be in good health, sound mind and physical fitness for the job,\u201d CAN said.\n\nCommenting on CAN\u2019s directive, Pastor Omakwu said: \u201cBy the grace of God, He will give us this kind of leader we want. I will add my own advice and say that we should do what Bishop Abioye said this time, we should fight to defend our faith. Power is first about spiritual control before the physical. These people don\u2019t care about governance. This time around, anyone that has the inclination to continue what we have been going through, we would say no that person. Anyone that has the inclination to side one religion above the other, we would fight that person.\n\n\u201cEvery Nigerian has the right to worship. If they want to worship a stone, the constitution allows everyone that freedom. This year by the grace of God, we would select a good person. God forbid that a Christian would take their thumb and vote for someone that would restrict our religious freedom. May that person not be named. We would vote and defend our faith. Every Christian has a right to be a Christian and every Muslim has the right to be a Muslim, so also does every traditional worshiper has a right to worship. Even if you don\u2019t want to believe in God, He gives you the freedom not to believe in Him and no one must contain those liberties,\u201d she said.",

          "text": ". Formally unveils VP candidate\n\nKuni Tyessi in Abuja\n\nAhead of the 2023 presidential elections, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) Sen Rabiu Musa Kwankwanso has called on Nigerians to sack leaders that have continuously blamed victims of insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to Kwankwanso, instead of fixing the insecurity challenges, the leaders who have failed are now blaming the victims of insecurity, ignoring their plight.\n\nSpeaking during the unveiling of his presidential running mate, Bishop Isaac Idahosa in Abuja, Kwankwanso said they will leave no stone unturned to rescue Nigeria from bad leaders.\n\n\u201cTogether, we must leave no stone unturned for a new and a better Nigeria where justice and fairness rule, a Nigeria where peace, security is guaranteed. We want a Nigeria where unity and opportunity is available, a Nigeria which can be ruled by selfless leaders with integrity and competence, \u201c Kwankwanso said.\n\nThe former governor of Kano State, who said insincerity and intolerance by some leaders have inflicted severe wounds on Nigerians, added that such has further widened the fault line in the country.\n\n\u201cVictims of insecurity are ignored. They keep saying that insecurity is exaggerated. We live in a country where schools are shut down but some leaders are using hundreds of millions to purchase forms.\n\n\u201cAll these wounds must be healed. We believed that healing the wounds will bring prosperity and global respect.\n\n\u201cSelection of our party candidates was guided by competence, courage, acceptability and above all, to heal the country of wounds that are existing,\u201d Kwankwanso said, describing Bishop Isaac Idahosa as a patriot.\n\n\u201cHe emerged from over 20 candidates that were all qualified. We want an all-inclusive government that will be fair to all Nigerians. We present to you a rare Nigerian that fits these requirements.\n\n\u201cI present to you this 57-year-old Man of God, a Nigerian with an impeccable credibility and clear understanding of the country. He is a promoter of a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe is a man who believes that a better Nigeria is possible. I present to you this Nigerian man of God, Bishop and a senior pastor to whom together we shall heal Nigeria from the wounds that have been inflicted in her. A new Nigeria where Justice, fairness, security, development is assured. I present to you, the next president of the federal republic of Nigeria,\u201dKwankwanso said.\n\nSpeaking, the NNPP presidential running mate to Kwankwanso, Idahosa, who accepted the nomination, said the country deserves a fresh start and new ideas adding that Nigerians must not allow division and hate.\n\n\u201cA fresh deal that will steer the country from insecurity and allow every family to live a decent and credible life is what the NNPP is bringing to you, \u201c Idahosa said, adding that NNPP is fully prepared and capable of providing quality leadership to Nigerians.\n\nIdahosa said Nigerians must unite and work towards healing the country, adding that \u201cWe must rebuild Nigeria of our dreams and build a nation that invests in the youth, build Nigeria with new technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians must pay special attention to what is happening in the country and get their voter cards. If you have not done so, talk to every family on the need to vote in the next election,\u201d Idahosa said while thanking Kwankwanso, a man he described as the Madugu and the Jagora of Nigerian politics.\n\nIdahosa assured that they will put Nigeria to the part of development while calling on Nigerians to sack bad leaders and incompetent leadership.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Chairman of the NNPP, Rufa\u2019i Alkali, said their party is the dream team Nigerians have been waiting for.\n\n\u201cIt is a dream team Nigeria have been waiting for. This team is a collective journey to rescue Nigeria and the team is here,\u201d Alkali said.",

I am aware of it but I can\u2019t give the full account of it because the report I have is still sketchy.\u201d\n\nBut the source said the terrorists ransacked the residence of one Usman Abdullahi Yarima and abducted his two wives and three other members of the family before moving to Abdulraziz Lawal\u2019s house, where they also kidnapped his two wives and two other relatives.\n\nHe added that husbands of the abducted housewives, who were overpowered by the motorcycle-riding terrorists, scampered for safety which led to the abduction of the victims.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe terrorists attacked the Shema quarters in large numbers around 11:30p.m. yesterday (Sunday) night and abducted nine people despite a heavy downpour that we witnessed here yesterday.\n\n\u201cThey broke into the house of one Usman Abdullahi Yerima and abducted his two wives and three other family members in the compound.

You know it was raining seriously during that time, so all efforts we made to prevent the attackers from going with the victims proved abortive.\u201d\n\nHowever, Isah, while confirming the incident, said the Dutsin-Ma Armoured\n\nPersonnel Carrier vehicles and some police officers were drafted to the scene of the incident and engaged the terrorists in a gun duel.\n\nHe, however, debunked reports that the terrorists operated from 11:30a.m. to 2a.m., saying: \u201cWe got that report around 11a.m. but for them to have operated up to 2a.m. that\u2019s not true.\u201d",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nA Professor of Law and Judge of Enugu State High Court, Justice Cyprian Ajah, has warned lawyers in the country against undermining the ethics of the legal profession if they must continue to earn respect and confidence of the people.\n\nAjah said lawyers are custodian of the rule of law and the justice system, which is the bedrock of democracy and development, hence the need for a conscious effort to remain relevant in the country.\n\nThe charge was part of a lecture he delivered weekend, at the 2022 dinner of the Faculty of Law, Renaissance University, Ugbawka, Enugu State.\n\nRenaissance University is a community-based institution (boarding only), established 17 years ago by former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani.\n\nSpeaking on the theme: \u2018The Importance of Ethics in the Legal Profession\u2019, the judge stated that the legal profession has a huge responsibility in ensuring that rules of ethics are developed, adding that lawyers and the public are educated about ethics and made effective through disciplinary mechanisms.\n\nHe reminded lawyers of the need to constantly uphold the rule of law and access to justice, pointing out that: \u201cIf lawyers do not adhere to, and promote principle of justice, fairness and equity, the law itself will be brought to disrepute and public confidence in it dimmed.\u201d\n\nThe legal profession, he added, has a huge responsibility within the society as upholders of the rule of law and protectors of individual rights against abuse of power.\n\nAjah stressed that the current state of affairs in Nigeria demands the maintenance of reputation by the legal profession against fakes and quacks.\n\n\u201cA profession\u2019s collective reputation is crucial to the confidence it inspires. The reputation on the legal profession is linked to how the public views the administration of justice. Where there is no public confidence in the legal profession, trust in the justice system itself is undermined.\u201d\n\nHe advised lawyers to maintain the highest standard of honesty, integrity and fairness towards their clients, the court and members of the public, \u201cwhich includes promptly honoring of any undertaking given in the course of a lawyer\u2019s practice\u201d.\n\nHe paid glowing tribute to the founder and visitor of Renaissance University, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, for his profound vision in establishing and sustaining the nascent citadel of intellectual, human and entrepreneurial development.\n\nThis, he said, is an immense testimony to Nnamani\u2019s fervent and unrelenting love for education and youth empowerment.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two fintech executives and a manager at a US-based money transfer company have been sentenced to a combined 8 years in US federal prison.\n\nThe firm, Ping Express, admitted in US district court filings that it broke money laundering rules after it transferred $167 million out of the US. One hundred and sixty million dollars of that money was sent to Nigeria over a period of 3 years, some of which were proceeds from online romance scams.\n\nAccording to a statement released by US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Chad E. Meacham, the firm admitted it failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme and operated without a licence in at least 5 US states.\n\nPing Express CEO Anslem Oshionebo, 45, and COO Opeyemi Ode, 43, both recently received 27-month prison sentences, and the company\u2019s business manager, Aleoghena Okhumale, received a 42-month prison sentence for intentionally transferring criminal proceeds.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Oshionebo, a former senior manager at PwC, said in an email that he did not have the resources to continue fighting the case and \u201chistory will be the best judge\u201d. On his part, COO Odeyale claimed the case against him had \u201cgross violations\u201d.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Ping\u2019s anti-money laundering policy claimed it limited first-time customer transactions to $499, daily transactions to $3,000, and monthly transactions to $4,500. The company admitted in court filings that it \u201callowed more than 1,500 customers to violate these rules. In one instance, Ping allowed a customer to remit more than $80,000 in a single month\u201417 times more than the purported limit,\u201d read part of the statement.\n\nPing Express also admitted it failed to seek sufficient details about the sources or purposes of the funds it helped to transmit, or the customers initiating the transmissions. By law, the company was supposed to report any suspicious transactions to regulators. But according to the company\u2019s court filings, it failed to make a single anti-money laundering report in 3 years of operation.\n\nAccording to DoJ statements, Collins Orogun, one of Ping\u2019s top customers and a co-defendant in the case, admitted to receiving a fee for laundering money for \u201cromance scam\u201d fraudsters and other criminals. Over a period of 2 years, the DoJ says he received more than $1.3 million in cash, cashier\u2019s cheques, and wires into several US bank accounts he controlled, and then quickly moved more than $1 million of the funds to Africa through Ping.\n\nIn one incident, an Indiana woman wired $15,000 to \u201cCarson Jacks\u201d, a putative oil roughneck in the Gulf of Mexico she fell in love with online, after he claimed to have malaria. Another Indiana woman claimed to have fallen in love online with an Irish ship captain named \u201cThomas Ken\u201d and wired him $6,300 to fix his ship. Orogun facilitated both payments through Ping.\n\nOrogun now faces up to 20 years in federal prison when sentenced on January 23, 2023.\n\nPing Express itself faces up to 5 years of probation and a $500,000 fine.\n\nPing COO Odeyale also founded a UK-registered electronic money firm, Payzen Limited, formerly Clicks FX Limited in 2013. In December 2020, about 10 months after he was formally charged by US DoJ officials for failing to maintain an effective AML programme and operating without a licence, he relinquished his controlling stake in Payzen. The UK business was not mentioned in the US case, but filings on the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) website show that Payzen also trades as Ping Express. Per Bloomberg, the current controlling shareholder of Payzen, Adekanmi Adedire, said that his company is \u201cunrelated\u201d to Ping Express, which is a \u201ctotally different entity\u201d. However, Payzen\u2019s website on the FCA\u2019s online database is still listed as ping-express.com.\n\nShare this article",

Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Softcom\u2019s Weyinmi Barber is making HR desirable one startup at a time",
          "text": "\u201cHR is something you learn by doing. It is experience, not book. Yes, there are certifications, but those certifications are handy after you\u2019ve worked a while and you know where you want to focus.\u201d \u2013 Weyinmi Barber, SVP, People and Culture, Softcom.\n\nA well-known irony in the job market is that some jobs or industries that were sought after some 10 to 15 years ago no longer occupy that position and others have had to simply evolve to stay relevant. While it looks grim for those ones, some jobs that are now highly rated might also start struggling with relevance in a few years.\n\nSome roles like human resources (HR) have survived every evolution the job market has experienced, yet it remains one of the most underrated in companies. It would be great to dive into why this is so straight away, but we will get there soon.\n\nI was at the Softcom head office in Ikeja on a warm July afternoon to speak with Weyinmi Barber, the SVP, People and Culture, a.k.a, head of HR. While we prepped for our conversation, I was determined to get her take on why startups do not pay attention to HR despite its implied importance. And her response was not far from my theory.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand how important it is. What usually happens with startups is they get to a certain level and they start having HR crisis and at that point, they are running around looking for HR professionals.\u201d\n\nIn conversation with Weyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom at the Softcom Head office, Ikeja, Lagos\n\nFrom the hour-long chat, I deduced how important it is to have an HR team, from easily hiring the right people to having a defined recruitment process and everything in between.\n\nIt is safe to say that Weyinmi Barber is passionate about HR and is on a mission to make it desirable despite people\u2019s misconceptions. Like me, when you get to know about her quirkiness from childhood, you\u2019d understand that she has been giving away the \u2018people\u2019 vibe for a long time.\n\nFinding a path that fits\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nWarri-born Weyinmi still reminisces about her childhood in Delta State, Nigeria, when she spent a lot of time outdoors with other children. Recalling her adrenalin rushes as parents called out to their children at the end of day, she recounted how her favourite time was the twilight, just before sunset.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the Weyinmi we see today, and her parents\u2019 influence contributed largely to it.\n\nWeyinmi\u2019s quest for knowledge to satisfy her curiosity drove her towards books and she tried to associate what she read with real life. Consequently, she built her vocabulary and was comfortable with long texts in school. Expectedly, she developed a vibrant and artistic personality, asking many questions and trying her hands at different crafts.\n\nWeyinmi is careful not to attribute her success to only her work.\n\n\u201cI grew up with parents who valued education,\u201d she said.\n\nPaying attention to everything she loved doing, they were ready to support her in whatever field she chose. We smiled about how she went through various phases trying to choose a career based on self-discovery at different points of her life. It was writing at one point and fashion management at another, with management consulting coming up later in university.\n\nAt a time when the information technology (IT) industry was unpopular, Weyinmi chose to study information resources management at Babcock University, graduating as the year\u2019s overall best student.\n\nBut after graduation, she did not have the best experience practising as an information management analyst. In hindsight, it would have been different if she was exposed to the suitable side of the tech industry.\n\n\u201cFor the first two years of my career, I was an IT person but I didn\u2019t really like it. I\u2019ve now been told that I didn\u2019t get the right exposure to tech, to the software side of things.\u201d\n\nWorking in IT more than a decade ago did not necessarily mean you were into software engineering or app development, as is often the case today. The roles were mostly administrative and tech support-related, none of which appealed to Weyinmi. After a while, she decided to get a master\u2019s degree, and got a scholarship \u2014 thanks to her excellent record during her first degree \u2014 to study management and business excellence at the University of Warwick, UK.\n\n\u201cI was very fortunate to go to a school with a career centre. You could go there and have conversations with people, get counsel about what kind of career path you should consider based on your personality, temperament, and strengths. One of the career options that came up for me was HR.\u201d\n\nThis was a revelation for Weyinmi as her discipline was quite different from her dispositions. She made a mental note to seek a job in HR job once she resumed job hunting and her first job back in Nigeria was at Oando Plc, a multinational in the oil and gas sector.\n\nBecause Weyinmi is driven by the need to have an impact, she has learnt to let time take its course, constantly reminded by a Warren Buffet quote that \u201cYou can\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to be associated with things that are working, successful, and good. That really drives me and my work ethic.\u201d\n\nBut, changing industries wasn\u2019t as easy as opening a new page or skimming over a paragraph.\n\nTwo years might seem like enough time to build expertise in a field, but Weyinmi\u2019s decision to give up information analysis to pursue HR was a challenge, and she felt she was already behind her peers.\n\n\u201cI really threw myself into it because I had that sense of \u2018I need to catch up. I really need to learn as much as I can and as quick as possible so that I can start to see the kind of growth that I want for my career.\u2019 Because of that, I was very intentional about developing myself.\u201d\n\nConsequently, she took risks to ensure consistent development, one of which was turning down a senior role in another department to spend more time where she was to develop expertise.\n\nIn eight years, she had filled HR support, analyst, business partnership, and compensation and benefits specialist roles. But then, she was ready for another adventure, this time in a contrasting industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently building my career in HR leadership in the tech startup space,and I really enjoy what I do. I was very fortunate to have intentionally chosen a career path that I believed was a good fit. And the last two years have been HR in the tech startup space.\u201d\n\nA whole new world of HR\n\nWeyinmi Barber having a chat with other Softcom employees (Softcomers)\n\nIn 2020, Weyinmi joined Softcom and developed an organisational framework for the tech company, an achievement she considers one of her highest points to date. She believes the tech space is a great fit for her, and she sees herself spending many years in the industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the challenge, I enjoy being around tech people, I enjoy the conversations, the energy, and most of all, I really enjoy that sense of connection to purpose. I haven\u2019t seen it in any other industry.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi is quick to add the striking difference between the corporate and startup space. After eight years in the oil and gas sector, you would have thought she\u2019d seen it all, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cI did HR for many years, but the tech space is different. Many of the things that are considered best practices in HR work in other industries, but they don\u2019t work in the startup space. So you have to do things differently.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned particularly how the \u201cpeople issues\u201d are unique and created a scenario to pass the message.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of traditional industries, maybe banking and consulting, there\u2019s generally a correlation between your competence and years of experience. That doesn\u2019t work in the tech space, especially for engineers, because someone who has really developed themselves in two years might be writing better code than someone who has been doing it for six years,\u201d she explained.\n\nTo keep up with industry requirements, Weyinmi has kept herself relevant by doing professional courses. But that\u2019s not all.\n\n\u201cOne thing I really had to learn was stakeholder management. What I learnt is how to listen to all the sides of the story.\u201d\n\nShe went on to mention how this has helped her understand human behaviour and make better judgement, especially in arbitration cases.\n\nSatisfaction, for her, comes in various forms, but she thoroughly enjoys seeing her solutions solve real-life problems.\n\n\u201cI like creating initiatives to solve problems. Then you roll out the initiative and you see it work, and then you\u2019re getting feedback from people. It\u2019s very satisfying.\u201d\n\nGetting a grip on HR\n\nThe past decade has seen Weyinmi in learning and development, talent acquisition/recruitment, compensation and benefits, and HR business partnership, among others,all of which have improved her expertise.\n\n\u201cI was very lucky to be in different roles, it wasn\u2019t like I was doing the same thing. What that helped me do was have time to figure out where in HR do I want to focus?\u201d\n\nAnd having to spend an average of two years in some of these departments, Weyinmi is sure where she fits.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I realised that the aspect of HR I really liked was organisational design. That\u2019s where you develop HR strategies and come up with initiatives to try and solve people issues, whether it\u2019s building a career framework, developing a talent management framework and applying it to your organisation.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi Barber chatting with Softcom COO, Adetoyosi Elegbede\n\nFor context, when there\u2019s a particular people problem in an organisation, the HR professional\u2019s job is to develop a framework to address it and that is applicable for future occurrences. Since no two organisations are the same, the professional has to come up with bespoke solutions for the company, to achieve optimal results.\n\nWeyinmi is proud to have made the employees of 15-year-old Softcom happy. The tech company is the parent company of a number of startups including Eyowo, Kwiksell, Useform, and Usepass.\n\n\u201cI was privileged to build Softwork\u2019s first career framework. Now, every Softcomer knows their band level, they know what the next level is, they know what they have to do to go to another level, and they know the time of the year promotion happens. We built a policy around that,\u201d she noted.\n\nWith people changing career paths easily, she\u2019s doing her best to match the uniqueness of the startup space.\n\n\u201cThey come in as one thing, six months later they are doing something else, and you have to figure out a way that they can grow.\u201d\n\nDuring our chat, Weyinmi categorised the things people looking to get into HR should know based on where they are in their careers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still in school or a fresh graduate, look for opportunities to do internships in HR departments of companies in different industries. This will help you understand the kind of HR you prefer.\n\n\u201cIf you already have a job, you can have a conversation with your line manager and the people in your HR department and let them know you are interested. If there\u2019s an opportunity for you to move into the HR team, [take it]. If you go and look for a job in another company, you might not get it because, on paper, you do not have the experience.\u201d\n\nShe also revealed what a professional should expect while joining a team.\n\n\u201cUsually, if you\u2019re the first HR professional to join a startup, you\u2019re literally walking into a storm unless you are lucky to have a founder or co-founder who has had exposure to certain environments and they understand that HR is an important need from get-go. It sometimes takes that storm for the leaders to then realise that they need an HR team.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi listed communication, stakeholder management, behavioural science knowledge, and good presentation skills as important soft skills to acquire while considering a role in HR. And depending on the area of specialisation, it is important to develop proficiency in using spreadsheets and be comfortable with numbers, project management, and administration.\n\nOpening up about how it feels to be an HR professional, she said,\n\n\u201cIt can be very lonely and isolatory being an HR professional. People almost see you like the police of the company, forgetting that you\u2019re an employee too with a career to build and goals and aspirations. Having your peers behave differently around you is not fun.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi\u2019s activities on a typical work day depend on what is going on at the company. Responsibilities during recruitment differ from those during employee appraisal.\n\nShe\u2019s a big supporter of the hybrid work style and how it\u2019s great for work-life balance.\n\nFor productivity, \u201cI set alarms/reminders for the most random things. It helps me to be productive. Another thing that helps with productivity is knowing what time of the day you function best so that you can schedule important tasks for that time of the day.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi has bungee jumping and sky diving on her bucket list and sometimes refers to herself as an adrenaline junkie.",

          "text": "With its transition to a commercial entity, there are growing concerns the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited may battle old perennial problems as it seeks to raise capital from financial institutions to fund projects and tackle funding shortfalls with joint ventures.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NNPC Limited officially transitioned to a private business for the first time in 43 years, a development seen as the biggest attempt at transparency and accountability since 1977, and equally greeted with positive reactions across the country.\n\nLike its peers Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), the development allows NNPC Limited to leverage being a commercial entity to raise quick cash, fund its operations, attract investments and give some verve to the country\u2019s beleaguered energy sector.\n\nHowever, experts have raised concerns about the corporation\u2019s employee structurces, high credit sales, high indebtedness, low revenues and low gross profits as factors likely to hinder the success of the company under the new arrangement.\n\nFor instance, Niyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited, questions how NNPC limited will succeed as a commercial entity with a workforce employed for political reasons.\n\n\u201cTransiting from a political or civil servant culture with a nonchalant attitude to a business entity with profit culture is a very long ordeal for NNPC Limited,\u201d Awodeyi added.\n\nAdenike Aloba, Programme Director/Managing Editor at Dataphyte, a research and data analytics organisation said the subsisting problems would resurface as the government-run corporation transits to a private liability company.\n\n\u201cBased on the 2019 and 2020 audit statements, there are issues that if not addressed, may impede the successful operations of the organisation as a private business entity in the short and long term,\u201d Aloba said.\n\nRead also: Buhari charges new NNPC to sustain Nigeria\u2019s energy security\n\nTo arrive at a profit of N287 billion, the first in its 44-year history, NNPC Limited declared a net impairment reversal of N713 billion in 2020 compared with a loss of N273 billion in 2019.\n\nReversal of impairment is a situation where a company can declare an asset to be valuable where it has previously been declared a liability, according to a global body for professional accountants \u2013 Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).\n\nFinancial experts questioned how the NNPC Limited was able to revalue a whopping N713 billion initially assumed to be doubtful receivables from the federation account.\n\nAnother shocking revelation from the audited report is a 153.95 percent increase from the NNPC\u2019s Other Incomes from N266 billion in 2019 to N675.7 billion in 2020.\n\nThree major components of the Other Incomes include a N110.6 billion refund from the federation, N157 billion from sundry incomes (amounts recovered from the federation relating to strategic alliance balances), and a N250 billion from variation in crude stocks, which represents movements in crude inventory, under-lift and over-lift positions.\n\n\u201cThe cash infusion from the federal government is more than cash generated from the operations of the Corporation,\u201d Kalu Aja, director of finance and operations at a Washington-based Community Foundation of Snohomish County states, adding, \u201cTo be legal and clear, this is correct. The question is should a Corporation that has a negative short-term position post billions in accounting \u2018profits\u2019\u201d?\n\nWhile NNPC Limited struggles with inefficient operations, Saudi Aramco rewarded shareholders with $18.8bn in the second quarter of 2022, capitalising on soaring crude prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe payment is a vital source of revenue for the Saudi Arabian government, which still owns 94 percent of Saudi Aramco stock. It listed a sliver of the company\u2019s shares in December 2019 and passed another 4 percent to the Saudi sovereign wealth fund this year.\n\nThe company also said it would use $4 billion dollars in retained earnings to distribute bonus shares to shareholders \u2014 amounting to one share for every 10 shares held.\n\nAramco, which is at par with Apple Inc as the world\u2019s most valuable companies, reported a net income of $39.5 billion for the quarter to March 31 from $21.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThis is everything Nigeria wants to be in West Africa, but an inability to wean itself off petrol subsidies, coupled with a derelict government animated by corruption and inefficiency, continues to rain on its parade,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, says.\n\nIn the first five months of 2022, NNPC deducted N1.27 trillion for petrol subsidy \u2014 about 31percent of the N4 trillion provision for the year.\n\nOn Monday, the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, maintained that the determination of fuel prices would continue to be a decision by the federal government despite the firm\u2019s transition to a commercial entity.\n\nBut unlike his counterpart in Brazil state-run Petrobras oil company, Jose Mauro Coelho, who resigned from his post as CEO last month over President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s interference in the company\u2019s fuel pricing policy, Kyari said that the exercise would henceforth be performed for a fee for the Nigerian government.\n\nSpeaking during a prerecorded interview with Channels Television, Kyari stated that whereas before now the NNPC\u2019s function of being the sole importer may not have been on a commercial basis, it would henceforth charge a fee for the service.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the price of petroleum, this is a policy matter. And the NNPC is going to be a supplier to the Federation at a fee. So, the issue of at what price you sell petroleum will be the decision of the state,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nUnlike Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari, Brazil\u2019s president, who is seeking re-election in October, has been publicly bashing Petrobras for what he calls \u201cabusive profits\u201d and has sacked three of its chief executive officers over frustration with the company\u2019s wholesale fuel prices that track international levels.\n\nCoelho would be the third Petrobras CEO to have come and gone since Bolsonaro took office in early 2019, with the disagreements earlier leading to the ouster of former CEOs Roberto Castello Branco and Joaquim Silva e Luna.\n\n\u201cJust like Saudi Aramco and ADNOC, how NNPC limited inculcate international best practice decisions in its financial model will determine the success of the new private enitiy,\u201d Akinbobola concluded.",

          "text": "As the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Tuesday assumes a new status, President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the oil company to sustain Nigeria\u2019s energy security.\n\nThe new status is in fulfillment of the Petroleum Industry Act ( PIA), signed into law in August , 2021, by President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nThe President at the unveiling ceremony, affirmed that the company is now mandated by law to ensure that Nigeria\u2019s National Energy Security is guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking at the historic occasion at the State House Conference Centre, the President said Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company (NOC) would also support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nAt the event, which featured a Special rendition of the Theme Song \u201dEnergy for today, Energy for tomorrow, Energy for Everyone\u201d by an Ensemble, the President recounted how God had used him to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of the country\u2019s NOC in the last 45 years.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed optimism that the NNPC Limited will sustainably deliver value to its over 200 million shareholders and the global energy community; operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account (TSA).\n\nRead also: Oil spill: Eroton condemns vandalism, empathises with affected community\n\nDescribing the event as \u201c a landmark event for the Nigerian oil industry, the President reminded the organization that the \u201ccountry places high premium in creating the right atmosphere that supports investment and growth to boost our economy and continue to play an important role in sustaining global energy requirements.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are transforming our petroleum industry, to strengthen its capacity and market relevance for the present and future global energy priorities.\n\n\u2018\u2018By chance of history, I was privileged to lead the creation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the 1st July 1977. Forty-Four (44) years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector.\n\n\u2018\u2018The provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u2018\u2018Coincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorized transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company today.\n\n\u2018\u2018I therefore thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of our National Oil Company from the good to the great.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President, therefore, assured stakeholders in the industry that Africa\u2019s largest NOC will adhere to its fundamental corporate values of Integrity, Excellence and Sustainability, while operating as a commercial, independent and viable NOC at par with its peers around the world.\n\nHe added that the company would focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice to deliver energy for today, for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said with the signing of the PIA, which assures international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, the nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless.\n\n\u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr. President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments. In fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 percent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSylva described the unveiling of NNPC Limited as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the President for his unparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support towards ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u2018\u2018best human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018NNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe event had attracted global attention, with the oil Ministers of Niger Republic and that of Equatorial Guinea, as well as other global players in the oil and gas industry present.",

I have made the promise before and I am not going to go back. It will be record breaking in the history of this country that a State government was able to embark on 12 flyovers, not in 8 years. You\u2019ll remember these flyovers started in 2019, my second tenure. It is not that we started in 2015.\n\n\u201cFor you to do 12 flyovers in four years time, I don\u2019t see who has broken that kind of record. It is commitment. This is the campaign for us. This is the campaign for those who are running for Senate, campaign for those who are running for House of Reps, campaign for those who are running for House of Assembly, campaign for those who are running for governor. We have shown to the world that we can do it and we have done it.\n\n\u201cAnd I do know my successor will take from what we have done because he is part of what is going on in government. He knows everything. He will not want to bring down the standard. The standard we have set in this state, it will be difficult for anybody to bring it down. For me, I am very happy.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike revealed that State government will through an irrevocable standing order fund the two additional flyovers from its Internally Generated Revenue. He expressed delight that his administration has been able to fulfil its social contract with the people of Rivers State, whose support in the last seven years have been overwhelming.\n\n\u201cYou must give the people the best. Rivers people deserve the best and whatever it takes for me to give Rivers people the best I will do it, it doesn\u2019t matter how much it will cost me. What is important is Rivers people getting the best in their lives. And nobody in Rivers State today, except you\u2019re very wicked, except in your DNA is wickedness, that will not be happy with what we have done.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike remarked that Nigerians are beginning to prove that politicians can no longer take them for a ride by making promises that they cannot fulfill. According to him, the PDP in the State has performed and Rivers people can attest to it.\n\nThe governor declared that Rivers people will never allow those who conspired with their cronies to defraud the State of its assets while in office to impose a governor on them.\n\n\u201cIn Rivers state, what is our campaign? Rivers people, have we delivered or we have not delivered? Not people coming to tell Rivers people I will do this, no. I was a minster, what did you bring to your people? What you are bringing to us is somebody whom you connived with to carry our money to be governor. Rivers people will say no they\u2019ll not agree. So everybody show your work. What have you done.

She retired in 2016 and is the coordinator of APC women in Delta North.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some stage-managed protests by individuals who ordinarily are supposed to appreciate what the state government has done.\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that primary schools are under the local government councils in terms of how they are remunerated and how they operate.\n\n\u201cSometime last year, this same woman led a few persons contrary to the reality of what we are doing they come to Asaba, rub themselves on the ground, pour invectives on the governor in line with what those who have asked them to go and demonstrate.\n\n\u201cThey will begin to shout and cast aspersions on the person and office of the Governor. I have never seen where somebody will work in UAC and proceed to LEVENTIS to receive salary.\n\n\u201cWhat we have always done is to assist them because we believe that they are Deltans and you can recall in 2015 when we came into office, we met over seven months salary arrears owed local government council staff and primary school teachers.\n\n\u201cWe assisted them to clear up that arrears and even when we got bailout from the federal government we gave them a grant of N3billion which aided in clearing the backlog,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue of pensions, Aniagwu said the state government didn\u2019t employ the staff but assisting because the local government councils are not in a financial position to do so at the moment.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pensions we have also assisted them to pay, as at when we came they were getting N150m to tackle pensions and we upscaled it to N300m and to fastrack it further, we increased it to N500m monthly.\n\n\u201cWe have so far cleared Local Government Pensions to early 2018 and Primary School Teachers owed several years of arrears of pension to August 2016.\n\n\u201cWe have said that in addition to the N500m monthly grant, when we access the N150billion bridging finance we will release the sum of N10billion as grant to offset part of the pensions owed these pensioners by the local government councils.\u201d he said.\n\nOn the constant attacks on the governor by a former member of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Evance Ivwurie, the Information Commissioner said it was a mere politics of bitterness and hatred.\n\nHe said Ivwurie failed to return to the State Assembly on account of not being popular among his people and had since resorted to insulting the governor for no just cause.\n\n\u201cHe went about alleging that several funds have been taken and misappropriated but let me put it on record that all the loans we obtained are properly directed to areas they were meant for.\n\n\u201cAs a government we will remain steadfast and stay on course in delivering our promises to Deltans,\u201d\n\nAniagwu also took a swipe on Minister of State For Labour and Employment, Chief Festus Keyamo over an uncharitable comment on the state-of-affairs in the state.\n\nHe reminded Keyamo that students who were supposed to be in school are still at home because of lingering ASUU strike that the federal government failed to resolve.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind Festus Keyamo that in Delta, our universities are working while the ones that belong to the Federal government are still at home.\n\n\u201cWe remind Festus Keyamo that our children who are supposed to be in school are still at home and we urge him to work seriously with his senior colleague to ensure that the issues raised by ASUU are resolved as soon as possible,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Airline operators in Nigeria under the umbrella of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have begged the federal government to intervene over the continued rise in the price of aviation fuel.\n\nThis is as the price of the commodity which was sold at N200 in February this year has today increased to N780.\n\nThe operators called for the approval of fuel surcharge from the federal government.\n\nAON said approval for fuel surcharge will help cushion the effect of the continuous increase in the exorbitant price of aviation fuel on the airlines\u2019 productions.\n\nThe airlines operators in a statement addressed to the director general of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Captain Musa Nuhu and sent to the media by their president, Alhaji Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina, called for the removal of the five per cent fuel surcharge they have been paying to the NCAA.\n\nAccording to the statement, the operators identified the increase in the price of aviation fuel and lack of access to forex and their subsequent impact on the cost of their operations to the latest action.\n\n\u201cThe Airline Operators of Nigeria hereby wish to seek your kind approval of fuel surcharge as an ameliorative measure to cushion the effect of the continuous increase in the exorbitant price of Jet A1 on airline operations in the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the crippling effect of intermittent shortages of Jet A-1, the price has risen from N200 per litre in February 2022 to over N780 today. This has greatly increased the operational cost of airlines by well over 130%, yet airlines are unable to increase fares and as well suffer from the unavailability of foreign exchange to conduct their operations.\n\n\u201cIn order to forestall a backlash and total shutdown of the system, airlines are hoping to resort to an introduction of a fuel surcharge between 25% \u2013 40% of NUC as a way of offsetting the additional burden brought about by increased fuel cost bearing in mind that jet fuel accounts for about 40% of total operational expenses.\u201d\n\nThe operators, therefore, solicited the understanding and support of the regulatory agency \u201cby reconsidering and reviewing the decision that airlines are required to obtain approval for an initial three (3) months before implementation of a fuel surcharge, with a waiver of the demand that airlines pay an additional 5% on the fuel surcharge entirely separate from the 5% Ticket Sales Charge (TSC).\n\n\u201cUnless this is done, it will mean in effect that whatever is collected by the airlines as fuel surcharge to cushion the effect of the high fuel price will be taken away once again by NCAA. This in effect will amount to double jeopardy as airlines will be unable to offset the additional cost which the fuel surcharge is meant to address in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe operators proposed that taxes should be based on the portion of the fare due to airlines less the fuel surcharge which is specifically for the purpose of cushioning the effect of rising fuel price and not on the total paid for the ticket inclusive of the fuel surcharge (i.e. Fuel Surcharge should be exempted from TSC).\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, request that you would favourably consider and kindly affect our proposal to help alleviate the sufferings of airlines in the country given the current scarcity and the consistently rising cost of JetA1. This is standard practice all over the world; notably in Britain, America and Singapore among others.\n\nIn view of the pertinent and pressing nature of this issue, may we use this medium to kindly request an urgent meeting with airline CEOs to promptly address the matter?\u201d",

In the area of maintenance, we have a couple of airlines that we are doing checks for right now and the demand is actually increasing. We are busy trying to meet up with the demands because they are actually so huge right now.\n\n\u201cAn airline alone is giving us about 10 to 12 aircraft, so in the next 12 months, and by the time we look at all the airline operators who are giving us aircraft, we are looking at about almost 30 aircraft in the next 12 months. That\u2019s huge.\n\n\u201cSo we are trying to talk to our foreign partners to see how we can expand our capability and to also expand our manpower, tools, and others. It\u2019s quite a busy moment for us at 7 Stars Global Hangar,\u201d Balami said.\n\nSpeaking on his new airline, the 7 Stars Global Airline, he said his team was set to launch helicopters and charter aircraft.\n\nBalami said, \u201cWe are hopeful to launch our helicopters and private aircraft charter very soon. Hopefully, by next month, we should be launching. We have been able to renew all our aircraft manuals in the Civil Aviation and we are now at the final stage of demonstration where we can be issued Air Operators Certificate.

          "title": "What to expect in NNPC Limited",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari today unveiled NNPC Limited (NNPCL) at noon in Abuja, rolling out a new commercial juggernaut into town.\n\nThe new company is a big departure from the petroleum products entity established in 1977.\n\nThe NNPC transforms into a fully commercial entity, which means the federal government would henceforth halt all forms of funding for its projects.\n\nAs disclosed last night by Mallam Mele Kyari on Channels, the new NNPC which would now operate as a limited company will go for an Initial Public Offer (IPO) by June 2023 to boost its capital base.\n\nHe added that with a N200 billion initial capital outlay as well as $5 billion initial debt funding, the new NNPCL would \u201cbe one of the most efficiently run entities globally.\u201d\n\nKyari revealed that the boilers of the Dangote refinery would be fired in the first quarter of 2023, a development that will help Nigeria\u2019s \u201cforeign exchange supply situation.\u201d\n\nHe added that at the infant stage now the NNPCL would still be largely owned by the federation, but that the new company \u201cwill no longer require the approval of the executive or the National Assembly to borrow or seek financing for projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a space for private people to take equity in this company. But as we speak now, the shareholders are over 200 million Nigerians. There can be a second level of private ownership, that is by selling down some of these equities so that people can take it in their individual capacity not in the collective capacity as a nation.\n\n\u201cSo definitely the whole gamut of the changes will happen. And this company must be IPO ready immediately before you can talk about selling down of interest,\u201d Kyari stated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already on the positive trend and by the middle of next year, I\u2019m very, very confident that this company will be in a place to say we\u2019re ready for IPO and the nation will decide to go private completely in the sense that we can now sell their equity, which is different from being owned by the generality of Nigerians,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that the NNPC must now look for financing without recourse to the state. And indeed, the law is very, very clear that we will have no recourse to public funds.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go to the government anymore for financing. The reason is very simple we can no longer ask for a sovereign guarantee anymore.

And the key information we have from those partners are looking, we know what you are, we know what you\u2019re doing, we trust you and this is great for our company and our country,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nPrice increase:\n\nIn a taste of what is to come, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited has increased the pump prices for petrol for different parts of the country, for the first time ever.\n\nThe increase was contained in a notice addressed to fuel marketers with effective from Tuesday, July 19.\n\nIn Lagos, petrol will sell for N169, while in Abuja, it will sell for N174.\n\nIn the South West, South-South and North Central, petrol will sell at N179.\n\nThe price increases to N184 for the South East and North West, while the North East holds the highest price of N189.\n\nThe NNPC also adjusted its ex-depot price for petrol from N148.17 to N160 to N162 per litre in Lagos, while the Warri/Ogharra depot falls between the N162 \u2013 N165 range.\n\nThe Port Harcourt depot will sell at between N165 \u2013 N167.",

The rains are here again, and the weather forecasts have shown that we should expect a lot of rain this year.\n\n\u201cClogging the drains with silt and refuse puts all of us at risk of preventable flooding and attendant threat to lives and property during the rainy season.\n\n\u201cTherefore, let us desist from indiscriminate dumping of refuse on water channels. Motorists should also avoid driving through flooded areas during rainfall to prevent avoidable accidents and loss of lives,\u2019\u2019 he pleaded.\n\nFurthermore, George decried the poor attitude of many residents to the environment as impacting negatively on the efforts and huge investments made by the state government to ensure a flood-free Lagos.\n\n\u2018\u2018Flood control is a key component of the T.H.E.M.E Agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s administration because a flood-free Lagos is critical to the realization of the Greater Lagos vision.\n\n\u201cA good environment will promote the inflow of foreign and local investments as well as raise the quality of life for Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cSo, as citizens, we must play our part by ensuring we clean, clear, and dredge our drains and major collectors for the proper discharge of rain waters,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "Crisis has hit Academic staff Union of Universities (ASUU) as a breakaway faction of the union has dissociated itself from the ongoing strike in Nigerian universities.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Niyi Sunmonu, and the National Publicity Secretary, Ernest Nwoke, on Tuesday.\n\nThe factional group reiterated that it was not a part of the decision to embark on the ongoing strike by ASUU.\n\nThe faction also announced its independence as a union of academics in Nigerian universities.\n\n\u201cThe Congress of University Academics would like to seize this opportunity to announce its independence as a union of academic staff in Nigeria\u2019s public universities. Being a separate and independent union, CONUA has never been part of the decision to embark on the industrial action which has paralysed academic activities in our universities for five months now,\u201d it said.\n\nCONUA said it believed that strikes had a crippling effect on the Nigerian university system.\n\nIt added that the negative effects of the strikes had always been greater than their positive outcomes.\n\nThe union added, \u201cOur strongly-held view is that strikes wreak great havoc on the university system, and the concessions that are earned after every strike, over the decades, have amounted to pyrrhic victories when weighed against the systematic destruction of the local and global image of university education in Nigeria. Our preferred alternatives to strikes in resolving industrial disputes, therefore, include constructive engagement and constant dialogue with all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs CONUA, we are of the strong belief that strikes should never be a strategy of first recourse. Their deployment should be contemplated only when all other options have failed, and they should not appear to be motivated by a desire to cause maximum damage.\u201d\n\nThe union noted that its members have continued with academic activities at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, and Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma after the strike declared by ASUU.\n\n\u201cIn fact, before the incident, which caused the students to be asked to vacate the campus, most of our members had concluded their lectures. Since it wasn\u2019t our members who declared a strike, lumping us together with those who are on strike is therefore patently unfair,\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the union has decried the conditions of service of Nigerian academics and the inconsistencies associated with the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System, both major demands of the striking ASUU.\n\nCONUA said the condition of service of the academics was one of the poorest on the African continent.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, CONUA notes, regrettably, that the condition of service of academics in Nigeria is very poor. It is, in fact, pitiable. Research has, in this regard, shown that Nigerian academics are among the worst remunerated when compared to their counterparts on the African continent,\u201d CONUA said.\n\nThe union added that it wrote to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, demanding the \u201creview of the pay structure of all academic staff in our universities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe in the urgency of such an action, and would continue to work towards the well-deserved improvement in the condition of service,\u201d it noted.\n\nThe statement also stated that CONUA believed that there were a lot of problems with the IPPIS, the current payment system.\n\nIt listed problems to include inconsistent deductions, and the erosion of university autonomy, saying it undermined the authority of vice-chancellors as chief executives and accounting officers of their respective institutions.\n\n\u201cCONUA, however, believes that these are issues that can be sorted out through dispassionate, well-meaning collective efforts, and is ready to offer the professional expertise of its members to the government to solve the problems.\n\n\u201cFinally, CONUA calls on the government to expeditiously register the union in order to provide a more robust platform for academics with alternative, pragmatic and more sustainable views to operate and engage with the government,\u201d the union added.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

The results of the next ballot are due at 1400 GMT on Tuesday.\n\nA new prime minister will then be announced on Sept. 5, after the Conservative Party\u2019s 200,000 members cast postal ballots over the summer.\n\nThe race has become focused on pledges, or non-pledges, to cut taxes, at a time when Britain\u2019s economy is beset with spiralling inflation, high debt and low growth that have left people with the tightest squeeze on their finances in decades.\n\nTruss has also come under fire for saying she would change the Bank of England\u2019s mandate.\n\nAt a televised debate on Sunday, candidates attacked each other over their records, and Truss and Sunak pulled out of a planned third debate on Tuesday, amid concern among Conservatives about candidates attacking their party colleagues. read more\n\n\u201cThe nature of the Conservative Party is to have vigorous debate and then coalesce once a new leader is selected. I have no doubt that the same will happen on this occasion,\u201d Conservative former minister David Jones told Reuters.\n\nSunak extended his lead over Mordaunt, who lost support and registered one fewer vote than she had in round two.\n\nBookmaker Ladbrokes said on Monday Truss, who got seven more votes in round three than she had in round two, was now the second favourite, ahead of Mordaunt but behind Sunak.\n\nTruss\u2019s campaign tried to buttress their argument for lower taxes by citing a report by The Centre for Economic and Business Research, a private sector think tank, showing there was more room for manoeuvre from higher tax receipts.\n\nBut a top Bank of England official, Michael Saunders, pushed back at her suggestion the government should set a \u201cclear direction of travel\u201d for monetary policy, saying the foundations of Britain\u2019s framework were best left untouched. read more\n\n\u201cThe government very clearly does not set the direction of travel for monetary policy,\u201d Saunders, one of nine members of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said at a Resolution Foundation event in London.",

          "text": "The United Bank for Africa (UBA) has extended its operations to the United Arab Emirates with the official launch of its new branch at the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).\n\nUBA, which is known as Africa\u2019s global bank, until the latest expansion of its operation had for over seven decades, operated in 20 African countries, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and France.\n\nThe UBA (DIFC Branch) would operate under the Category 4 licence and would be regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the financial regulatory agency of the special economic zone, the Dubai International Financial Centre.\n\nThe UBA branch in the DIFC would service corporate & financial Institutions and customers across the Middle East with a core focus on correspondent banking, relationship management and advisory services.\n\nThrough this new expansion, the UBA Group would be able to harness opportunities in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia (MEASA), which comprises 72 countries with an approximate population of three billion and a nominal GDP of $7.7 trillion and thereby, reinforce its strong franchise as Africa\u2019s Global Bank, facilitating trade and capital flows between Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the new subsidiary in Dubai recently, the Chairman, UBA Group, Mr. Tony O. Elumelu, explained that with the Group\u2019s foray into the Gulf Region, UBA continues to focus on its strategic intent to lead the way when it comes to doing business in Africa.\n\nHe said \u201cCollaborating with our franchises in 20 African countries and the major financial centres of London, New York and Paris, UBA (DIFC Branch) will facilitate the financing of trade transactions between the Middle East and Africa, enabling trade finance and investments.\n\n\u201cWe have been looking forward to this day as it is the first time we will have presence in this part of the world. We know that our international expansion is incomplete if we are not present in the gulf.\n\n\u201cSo, today, we are now formally in four continents across the globe and serving over 35 million customers and still growing. Today also shows that UBA is also a strong franchise and we are expanding our reach across the world.\n\n\u201cWe are considering other locations that would complement what we are doing. This is just the beginning. On behalf of every one in UBA and our customers that made this happen because without them we would not achieve much, we say thank you to them and thank you to the authorities of UAE for granting us this authorisation to operate.\u201d\n\nAccording to Elumelu, who is also the Founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), pointed out that UBA is the only bank with Nigerian origin that has extended out of Nigeria to the UAE.\n\n\u201cAll others have come through other locations and it shows the strength and respect that the authorities in Dubai have for UBA. We are always very deliberate in executing our strategy. We have a long-term view, but we take them one step at a time.\n\n\u201cThat is why you have seen consistent progress by UBA. It is not common to find enterprises with that kind of pedigree.\u201d\n\nAlso, UBA\u2019s Group Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Kennedy Uzoka, who also spoke at the event said: \u201cToday, we are formally on four continents across the globe, operating in 24 countries, serving over 35 million customers and still growing.\n\n\u201cWe are the only bank with Nigerian origin that has extended out of Nigeria to the UAE. Those before us have come through other locations and that shows the strength and respect the Dubai authorities have for UBA. Our presence in Dubai affirms that UBA is a strong franchise, expanding its reach across the world.\u201d\n\nUzoka added: \u201cThe authorities and business environment here in the DIFC is phenomenal and UBA is seeing Dubai as the gateway for Africa and that is why we are here, to be closer to our clients, to be partnering with them and facilitate businesses and trade flows into Africa through the UBA franchise. So, we are super excited.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the CEO, UBA(DFIC), Mr. Vikrant Bhansali, said: \u201cTrade, commerce and investments in Africa are expanding in the Gulf Region and Asia. Leveraging the presence of UBA Group in global financial centres, UBA (DFIC) will enhance the ability of the group to facilitate access of Gulf investors and banks to African markets. We will finance trade, facilitate commerce and help grow investment in Africa, across all sectors.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the Executive Director, Treasury & International Banking, UBA Group, Mr. Chiugo Ndubisi, said the birth of UBA (DFIC), \u201cgives us the opportunity to showcase the UBA brand to our various corporates that operate from the Middle East as well as other African financial institutions and global financial institutions that operate in this area.\n\n\u201cThat would give us easy access to funding, which is why treasury is key for us. It also gives us the opportunity to support trade flows for some of our customers in and out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, DIFC Authority, who spoke during the ribbon cutting ceremony, Arif Amiri said: \u201cUBA(DFIC) attests to the strong relationship between Dubai and Africa. It is a beautiful start as we are looking forward to achieving more interaction, channeling more trade and investments into Africa, and with UBA DIFC, we are closer to achieving our objectives. DIFC will continue to seek partnerships that will deliver winning relationships as we have just witnessed with UBA Group.\u201d\n\nUBA is a leading pan-African financial institution, offering banking services to more than thirty-seven million customers across 1,000 business offices and customer touch points in 20 African countries.\n\nWith presence in New York, London and Paris and now the UAE, UBA is connecting people and businesses across Africa through retail, commercial and corporate banking, innovative cross-border payments and remittances, trade finance and ancillary banking services.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "title": "Seven Takeaways from Osun Gubernatorial Election",
          "text": "Last Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, which saw candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, emerged winner, has left on the political space, some instructive takeaways no one can gloss over at this material time.\n\nAlthough the takeaways cut across interests and political parties, the inherent lessons addressed some of the mistakes, identified the strengths that played in, exposed the weaknesses that unsettled certain equations and hinted at the prospects therein for the actors to cultivate and leverage ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Power of BVAS\n\nSaturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, was one of the finest undertakings by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), if and when the success is measured.\n\nThis, however, was made possible, largely because of the use of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), an electronic device designed to read Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and also authenticate voters.\n\nThe Osun election, to a very reasonable extent, was credible, free and fair, thus producing the sort of result difficult for any honest competitor in the election to challenge, not even the defeated governor, Gboyega Oyetola.\n\nThis is why both the leadership of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which despite frustrations from certain quarters, stuck to its guns, and President Muhammadu Buhari, who wasted no time in approving it, because it would enhance his resolve to leave behind a legacy of decent electoral culture, are commendable.\n\nWhere\u2019re Obi and Kwankwaso?\n\nThe Osun election, as critical as it was, being the last off-season exercise before next year\u2019s general election, has exposed the fa\u00e7ade of the OBIdient Movement, whose face is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, and the much-talked about influence of the strongman of Kano State\u2019s politics, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso.\n\nWhile Obi\u2019s Labour Party failed to fly despite fielding a prominent person as its candidate, Hon. Lasun Yusuf, who was at a time a deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Kwankwaso\u2019s New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) was completely not in the equation.\n\nUnfortunately, for these two gladiators, over 3,000 youths in Osun registered for the election, the highest in recent time, yet, those who voted were split mainly between the two big parties \u2013 the APC and the PDP. It would appear that the two, especially, Obi is social media tiger with zero ground game. Indeed, they may actually pose no threat in the 2023 elections.\n\nDavido, the Game Changer\n\nHip-hop mega star, David Adeleke, with the stage-name, Davido, deployed his overwhelming influence and used same to neutralise the opposition for his uncle and winner of the election, Senator Ademola Adeleke.\n\nDavido, many may recall, played similar role in the campaign of his uncle in 2018, when Adeleke gave his first shot at the governorship of the state and lost.\n\nBut in the days leading to the Saturday, July 16 election, Davido gave his all, including giving a free show to potential voters, mobilising the youths and coordinating the undecided online, a development many believed greatly impacted the outcome of the election.\n\nWithout a doubt, Davido made a huge difference in the victory of his uncle.\n\nTinubu and Oyetola: W\u00f5n Lu\u2019le\n\nPerhaps, the duo of presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu and outgoing Governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, might have fallen at a rather inauspicious time. An election that should have signposted a promising 2023 general election for them became foreboding.\n\nOrdinarily, as the presidential candidate of the ruling party, Tinubu was expected to provide the much-needed coattail for the victory of Oyetola in Osun and by extension, give an indication of the things to come as the nation journeys towards 2023.\n\nBut all that failed to give. Instead, they both lu\u2019le in a big way. Question is, was it a sign of potential crisis for the candidate and his party or fatigue has begun to set in for Tinubu? Either way, the outcome of the election was ominous for Tinubu and the APC, lest, they pay attention.\n\nPDP on Rebound?\n\nPerhaps, the election was a clear sign that the opposition PDP was on a rebound, although not yet uhuru. The PDP must have to put its house in order as quickly as possible \u2013 assuage frayed nerves and bring everyone together for the challenge ahead.\n\nSuffice it to say that the Adelekes played a major role in the life of the PDP in the state and by implication, the eventual success of their son, Ademola, at the poll. There is, however, no better time for the PDP to do a review and fully get its groove back than now.\n\nThe Osun election has shown that 2023 could be anyone\u2019s game and the incumbency factor would be accorded no place whatsoever. While the election is open to the most hardworking of the parties to take, it goes without saying that the PDP is coming on stronger and better and might as well take its chances.\n\nReligion on Sabbatical\n\nComing at a time a controversy about the place of religion in the body polity was unceasing, it was shocking to see that religion played no role in the outcome of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State.\n\nAlthough a debate over which faith Ademola Adeleke subscribes to has not been properly exhausted, the general submission is that either as Nurudeen or Jackson, he swings both ways, which makes it easier for him to maintain some sort of balance between the two religions.\n\nThat is not to say, however, that Osun could be said to represent Nigeria with all its contradictions and fault lines. It is, nevertheless, exciting to note that religion took the back seat when the fate of Osun was decided at the poll last Saturday.\n\nAPC Brand Troubled?\n\nThere\u2019s no how the Osun election is analysed and the submission would be kind to the ruling party as it were. The APC, up until Saturday, was the ruling party in both Osun and the federal government and yet, lost the election woefully than it won it in 2018.\n\nIs that some verdict on the government of Oyetola in Osun State and by extension, the government of Muhammadu Buhari? Does it say something about the leadership of the party under the command of Senator Abdulahi Adamu?\n\nWhatever it is and whichever scenario is applicable, there\u2019s an urgent need for the APC to do some introspection and fix things as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, there would be no grounds to re-try its popularity before the general election next year; it can still put in some efforts and hope they turn out well.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "With the Nigerian National Company Limited (NNPC) officially transitioning into a private entity that would be regulated in line with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) from Tuesday, the Group Chief Finance Officer (Group CFO) will be expected to shoulder additional responsibilities of not only ensuring the liquidity of the group but efficient allocation of capital to businesses based on rate of return and business/project priorities.\n\nAlso,, Nigeria\u2019s federal government would henceforth halt all forms of funding for projects and sundry purposes in contrast to what has obtained in the last 45 years of the national oil company\u2019s existence.\n\nTHISDAY findings showed that from the new structure of the NNPC, the Group CFO would have to work closely with the Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) of the company to ensure profitability of the company.\n\nThe new NNPC Limited structure which would be launched by President Muhammadu Buhari, is in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs Commission had on September 21, last year completed the incorporation of the NNPC Limited in accordance with the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\nThe PIA was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on 16th August, 2021, following its passage by the National Assembly in July of the same year.\n\nSpecifically, Section 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of the enactment of the PIA in consultation with the Minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the Company.\n\nWith the registration by the CAC, the NNPC Limited was floated with an initial capital of N200 billion making history as the company with the highest share capital in the country.\n\nFrom when the PIA was signed into law last year, the management of the NNPC has taken proactive steps to prepare it for the July 1 take-off as a CAMA company.\n\nHowever, while the structure of the senior management team of the NNPC Limited would change with its new status, its Board would remain as inaugurated by Buhari.\n\nBut the Group CFO position is the next key important position in any CAMA company and the Group CEO and Group CFO must work together to ensure not only the success of the company, but the sustenance of adequate internal checks and controls.\n\nFurthermore, the Group CFO would entail additional responsibility of not only ensuring the liquidity of the group, but efficient allocation of capital to businesses based on rate of return and business or project priorities.\n\nThe Board committees had long been set up and in place consistent with Nigeria\u2019s Code of Corporate Governance.\n\n\u201cThe new structure will ensure an optimal structure that enables agility and ability to reward performance appropriately,\u201d a top official of the NNPC who pleaded to remain anonymous said.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, recently explained: \u201cOn 1st of July, we crossed over to the NNPC Limited both technically and financially on every aspect. Not only that, on the 19th of July, I\u2019m inviting all of you to be present. Mr. president will unveil the NNPC Limited to all of us on the 19th of July, and I\u2019m inviting you.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this to our industry is that you\u2019re going to have the partner of choice, the partner that will support you, the partner that will be the largest capitalised company in Africa. Not only that, a partner that will be born of best practice, of everything that you can think of because we\u2019re going to be a CAMA company. We are going to be another Shell, decision making would be easy, finances will also be easy.\u201d\n\nFG to Halt Funding as NNPC Transforms to Full Commercial Entity Today\n\nMeanwhile, as the NNPC transitions to a full commercial entity today, the federal government would henceforth halt all forms of funding for projects and sundry purposes in contrast to what has obtained in the last 45 years of the national oil company\u2019s existence.\n\nThe new NNPC which would now operate as a limited company, the Group Chief Executive Officer, Mallam Mele Kyari, disclosed last night, would be completely set for an Initial Public Offer (IPO) by June 2023 to boost its capital base.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television, Kyari boasted that with a N200 billion initial capital outlay as well as $5 billion initial debt funding, the new NNPCL would be one of the most efficiently run entities globally.\n\nHe also said the Dangote refinery would commence operation in the first quarter of next year, which according to him would positively impact Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange supply situation.\n\nBefore now, Kyari stated that every effort to make sure that the company became a fully commercial company didn\u2019t work out because there wasn\u2019t the enabling environment or the enabling legislation to support it.\n\nLike its many global and local partners, who the GCEO stressed are operating without losing money, the NNPCL head noted that the firm has huge assets, and will have access to huge capital and the trust of the global business community unlike in the past.\n\nKyari stated that it was difficult to borrow before now because the NNPC was not a fully commercial company, assuring that there will be ease of transacting business with the new NNPC.\n\nAlthough in its teething stages the NNPCL would still be largely owned by the federation, he noted that the NNPC will no longer require the approval of the executive or the National Assembly to borrow or seek financing for projects.\n\n\u201cThere is a space for private people to take equity in this company. But as we speak now, the shareholders are the over 200 million Nigerians. There can be a second level of private ownership, that is by selling down some of these equities so that people can take it in their individual capacity not in the collective capacity as a nation.\n\n\u201cSo definitely the whole gamut of the changes will happen. And this company must be IPO ready immediately before you can talk about selling down of interest,\u201d Kyari stated.\n\nAccording to him, the new company was already working towards making sure it expands its capital base by allowing private equity in the firm and operate profitably.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already on the positive trend and by the middle of next year, I\u2019m very, very confident that this company will be in a place to say we\u2019re ready for IPO and it will be the decision of the nation to go private completely in the sense that we can now sell their equity, which is different from being owned by the generality of Nigerians,\u201d he explained.\n\nFrom now on, he disclosed that the National Assembly will no longer need to pass the appropriation for the purpose of its contribution to the joint ventures, cash calls and all other obligations in the various business agreements.\n\n\u201cWhat that means is that the NNPC must now look for financing without recourse to the state. And indeed, the law is very, very clear that we will have no recourse to public funds.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go to government anymore for financing. The reason is very simple that we can no longer ask for sovereign guarantee anymore. So the sovereignty vanishes,\u201d he explained.\n\nWith the new status, he noted that the company\u2019s interaction will be based on value addition, ability to pay back loans and general business credibility, dismissing insinuations that the non-functional refineries would impact on its core business.\n\n\u201cFirstly, refineries, and then filling stations, actually, they\u2019re the least of our assets. Although I clearly agree that they are the most visible of our assets,\u201d he stressed, adding that the real business is in the upstream.\n\nKyari stated that rather than rush into eliminating its hydrocarbons because of the so-called energy transition, at some point, there will be conversion of certain assets to process cleaner fuels, insisting that fossil fuels are not vanishing soon.\n\nKyari stated that although the NNPCL will not sack any of its over 7,000 direct employees, it will henceforth operate nimbly and become more transparent, even with a $5 billion existing credit line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen over a billion $5 billion of loan or financing. And the key information we have from those partners are look, we know what you are, we know what you\u2019re doing, we trust you and this is great for our company and for our country,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn whether the next administration would not roll back the current gains when the current administration is no longer in place, Kyari maintained that he doesn\u2019t foresee any political consideration in decision making in the organisation in the future.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho",
