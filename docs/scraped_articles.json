Ighoho represents the light and truth, while the Nigerian state stands for illegalities.\n\n\u201cOur position now is that the Nigerian Government should be honourable by respecting the verdict of a court of competent jurisdiction. The #20billion damages ordered by the court to be paid to Ighoho by the DSS must be paid with immediate effect in the interest of peace.\u201d",

Kanayo has warned youths between the ages of 25 \u2013 45 to be careful about how they live in order not to have regrets during their old age.\n\nAccording to the thespian turned lawyer, he noted that God gifted some people with long life so that they can reap the evil deeds of their youths.\n\nThe actor gave this advice via a video posted on his verified Instagram page with the caption, \u201cBe careful what you do at your youthful age or when you are in public office etc. You will pay for it. it\u2019s just a matter of time. enjoy your weekend.\u201d\n\nIn the video, he said, \u201cThere is a line of thought that has been crossing my mind for a long time now and I need to share it with you. I have noticed very critically that God has a reason for everything he does. Do you think that everybody who is old has longevity in his lineage? I think otherwise. Some people are kept by God to serve out their punishment for what they did when they were younger.\n\n\u201cYou see many old men walk around you, do not think it is longevity. God is punishing them for what they did to humanity, or people\u2019s wives when they were reigning. It is just like those who are in the civil service in Nigeria. When they are there, they do not believe that there is a life after office. They play god and God deals with them. So do not ever mistake old age for longevity. Be careful of what you do when you are between the ages of 25 and 45. God bless you.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Number of rearrested inmates increases to 120\n\n\u2026Jailbreak was successful because lessons were not learnt from previous ones- Ex DSS director\n\nBy Evelyn Usman\n\nThere are indications that Monday\u2019s jailbreak at the Kabba Medium Security Custodial Centre, MSCC in Kogi state might have been politically motivated following insinuation that most of the freed inmates were bandits who had planned to attack the state.\n\nThis followed an earlier intelligence report which, according to sources, revealed plans to carry out coordinated attacks on Adavi, Ankpa, Idah, Koton-karfe, Yagba East, Yagba West and Mapamuro areas of Kogi state.\n\nSchools were also not left out in the planned attacks according to intelligence reports, as schools in Kabba, Lokoja and Dekina, were reportedly targeted.\n\nSources told Vanguard that raids were carried out in some areas of the state, where some suspects alleged to be connected with the planned attacks were arrested.\n\nThe jailbreak, as gathered, would not have been unconnected with the arrest of the bandits, some of whom were said to be awaiting trial.\n\nMeanwhile, additional six inmates who escaped during the jailbreak have been rearrested, bringing the total number of rearrested inmates so far, to 120 out of 240.\n\nSenior Special Adviser to the State Governor on Security, Commander Jerry Omodara (rtd) who made the disclosure stated that concerted efforts were still on to arrest others, informing that security apparatus were being rejigged to avoid a reoccurrence of such in the state .\n\nHe disclosed that high profile criminals were released during the jailbreak, indicating that the action was thoroughly planned.\n\nBarring his mind on the jailbreak being politically motivated, Omodara, said, \u201c If you say it was politically motivated, I won\u2019t shy away from that because we have high profile criminals there. What happened cannot be far from politics because of the emerging political situations in the country.\n\n\u201d But we will not look at what has happened. Rather, we will be very focused on what we are doing and ensure we do not allow this to distract us but put our eyes on the ball, to be sure we keep the state safe.\n\n\u201cThe attacked facility is a federal institution. That notwithstanding, the response to the attack was fantastic. For now, I can tell you that about 120 of the inmates have been rearrested. We are moving very fast to make sure we get all the inmates back into the cell because that will rebuild confidence.\n\n\u201cKogi used to be one of the worst states in terms of security in this country. People avoided the state because it was the capital of kidnappers. But that changed along the line because concrete steps were taken to contain insecurity by this present administration.\n\n\u201cWe see the incident of Monday as a setback on our records in terms of security but it will also make us prepare more and rejig our architecture\u201d, Omodara stated.\n\nFormer Director, Department of State Services, Mr Dennis Amachree, in his reaction to the jailbreak, attributed it to lack of structure in the correctional centre.\n\nHe said, \u201c Kogi Medium Security Correctional Facility was breached because lessons were not learnt from previous jailbreaks in the state and indeed in the country at large. These faults can be found in the structures of our prisons. Some of these prison environments are not designed to prevent a breach.\n\n\u201cThere are no standard reinforced perimeter walls. No anti-scaling concertina wiring on the walls and definitely no alarm system to alert the guards of a breach.\n\n\u201cSecondly, prisoners are still locked up like animals in a zoo, rather than being helped to reform them from their crimes. Unless we correct these anomalies I can tell you another prison break is around the corner,\u201d he said.",

It is about the politics of 2023. It is about the wickedness of selfish politicians and the ungodly quest for power, by all means, devious, foul, impish, and impious. But do not despair just yet because the Security agencies in Kogi are compiling the names of the agent provocateurs and their sponsors, and shall as always bring them to book.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Bello has kept that promise several times, saying that regarding the contrived jailbreak a few days ago, almost all the fleeing convicts are back in custody.\n\nThe statement lamented that if some people are not contriving violence, they are sponsoring falsehood in the media, adding that if they are not procuring and sponsoring violence, they are lying and paying the media to build mountains out of molehills.\n\nIt also added that if they are not lying about salaries that have since been cleared, they are sponsoring mendacity in the media about corruption and monies allegedly fixed in Banks, tales most unfounded and demonic, assuring that their lies would not work as the governor is doing his best to put the state in sound footing for future development.\n\nHe lamented that against Kogi State and Governor Yahaya Bello is a growing hoard of soulless lie mongering, rumour churning, falsehood growing, deceit cultivating, blackmail dishing, and tale feasting political hirelings, stressing that their brief is satanic and wicked.\n\nProf. Chris explained that the truth is that Kogi State, under the watch of the 46-year-old technocrat in Lugard House, is the safest state in the North and the second safest state in Nigeria, and adjudged so by all available Security Index locally and internationally.\n\nHe noted that Kogi State is the most gender-sensitive state in Nigeria, with the longest-serving female Secretary to State Government in Nigeria, with females as Local Government Council deputies in all the Local Governments where men serve as Chairmen, adding that the state has females as Speakers of all the Local Government Council Legislatures, with the only Female ADC to a Governor in Nigeria and the highest number of women in any State Government (cabinet) in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement observed that Kogi State tops the chart in the servicing and cutting down of local debts, adding that the governor has clearly excelled in the management of the state resources while effectively running the state, that it has been able to service and also reduce the local debts of the state.",

Eches Divine Eches, stated these in an interview with journalists in Abuja ahead of its 45th anniversary and founder\u2019s day scheduled for today in Owerri, Imo State.\n\nHe predicted that the rising insecurity in the north may consume the entire nation since government has not been sincere in checking the activities of bandits that have been unleashing terror on the masses.\n\nHe, thus, advised government to caution Sheik Gumi whose utterances, he claimed, have emboldened the bandits, thereby, promoting their inhumane acts in northern region.\n\nHe insisted that except drastic measures are put in place to curtail Almajiri phenomenon, banditry would remain in the north for a long time with devastating effects on socio-economic life.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can\u2019t have Almajiri system of life and government in the last 40 years in our nation bringing up people without any trace to families, hometowns or nationalities. These children are scattered all over the streets without you knowing that someday they would leave the street and go to the bush where they would begin to do the trade of kidnapping.\n\n\u201cAlso, you can\u2019t, in a sane nation, have the likes of Sheikh Gumi, a religious scholar, going about promoting banditry and you don\u2019t think that this will continue. Yet, that is what we are seeing today. We are not seeing anything more than what we have planted.\n\n\u201cWe allowed this thing (insecurity) to continue and it is now going to consume the nation, if drastic measures are not put in place to take them (Almajiri) out of the streets. Give them a sense of belonging, put them in school, and help them realise their potentials.\n\n\u201cThese bandits were the Almajiri who used to be in front of our houses and begging. Howbeit, we are praying and that is why God is still sustaining our nation. I trust God will continue to sustain us in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nOn the 45th anniversary, Eches said the programme was necessary because it would provide opportunity to remember the labour of past heroes, including over 250 retired church leaders and indigent youths and women across the 27 LGAs in Imo State, who were weak and retired.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

It, however, said the one million march in New York had nothing whatsoever to do with IPOB.\n\nIts chairman, Prof Banji Akintoye, made the clarification in his response to allegation by presidential spokesperson, Garba Garba Shehu, that it was shocking that Yoruba nation advocates were throwing their lot in with IPOB, a designated terrorist organisation, and that they would be judged by the company they kept.\n\nAkintoye, in a statement by his communications manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye replied: \u201cWe want to put it on record that IPOB is not in any way involved in the ongoing March in New York. The IPOB banner you saw was obviously planted by agents of the Nigerian government, masquerading as members of NINAS for photo shots which we have since unraveled and checkmated.\n\n\u201cWe say to the presidency that the unintelligent attempt to cause frictions and divisions between the Yoruba people in the West and the Igbo in the East is dead on arrival. We shall continue to collaborate peacefully for the salvation of our people\u2026\n\n\u201cWe shall resume the March on September 24, opposite the United Nations Headquarters to tell President Muhammad Buhari to his face that his Miyyetii Allah people are the enemy number one of the people of South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria and they are the authentic terrorists.\u201d\n\nAkintoye stated that the peaceful demonstration has succeeded in exposing to the world, the perceived ongoing genocide and fraud being perpetrated by the Fulani-controlled Nigerian government against the peoples of the South and Middle-Belt Regions of the country, through the imposed 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe renowned historian said rather than losing sleep and temper over the march, \u201cthe Nigerian government should, without further delay, declare Miyyetii Allah a terrorist organisation as being demanded by NINAS, saying, \u201cthe real terrorists in Nigeria are operating under Miyyetii Allah. Our demand remains conduct of a referendum so that the Indigenous people of the South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria can lawfully and legally decide on their nationhood and sovereignty. We demand for the immediate abolition of the imposed 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe demand an end to the genocide, being perpetrated by Miyyetii Allah against our people. Miyyetii Allah is a terrorist group and it should be declared such by the United Nations. The invasion of our land in the name of grazing is enough.

          "text": "*Reiterate demand for presidency\n\n*FIRS opposes inclusion of Lagos in suit\n\n*Appeal Court reserves ruling\n\n* Report: Lagosians back Sanwo-Olu on VAT collection, anti-open grazing law\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja, Gideon Arinze in Enugu and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian Southern Governors Forum rose from a prolonged closed-door meeting yesterday in Enugu with a resolve not to drop the ball on critical issues that affect the South. They agreed, among other things, to commence the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) in their various states.\n\nThe southern governors reiterated their demand that the next president of the country should come from the South, in line with the principles of equity, justice, and fairness.\n\nThe resolutions came as the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) opposed a request by Lagos State to be joined as an interested party in the agency\u2019s appeal against a Federal High Court judgement that opposed the agency\u2019s collection of VAT in Rivers State.\n\nIn a related development, a report revealed that eight in 10 residents of Lagos State, representing the majority of the residents, had thrown their weight behind the Babajide Sanwo-Olu government and the state House of Assembly on the passage and signing into law of the VAT Law and the prohibition of open grazing Act.\n\nThe southern governors\u2019 meeting was a follow-up to earlier meetings held in Delta and Lagos states, where the governors reached conclusions to ban open grazing to curb increasing farmer-herders crisis, and demand restructuring of the country, and introduction of state police.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the meeting, which was attended by nine governors and seven deputy governors from the region, Chairman of the forum and Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, said the state governments had the power to collect VAT within their territories. Akeredolu noted that the collection of VAT by various state governments would boost economic growth and promote development.\n\nThe forum expressed satisfaction with states in the region that had successfully implemented the anti-open grazing law in line with the decision reached during the southern governors\u2019 meeting in Delta State. The forum called on other states in the region that were yet to implement the decision to do so expeditiously, as according to Akeredolu, it represented the aspirations of the people in the region.\n\nThe governors, in the communiqu\u00e9, \u201cexpressed satisfaction with the rate at which the states in the southern Nigeria are enacting or amending the anti- open grazing laws, which align with the uniform template and aspiration of southern governors and encouraged the states that are yet to enact this law to do so expeditiously.\n\n\u201cEncouraged the full operationalisation of already agreed regional security outfits; which would meet, share intelligence and collaborate, to ensure the security and safety of the region.\n\n\u201cReaffirmed its earlier commitment to fiscal federalism as resolved at the inaugural meeting of the Forum held on Tuesday, 11th May 2021 at Asaba, Delta State, and emphasised the need for the southern states to leverage the legislative competence of their respective states Houses of Assembly as well as representation in the National assembly to pursue its inclusion in the Nigerian Constitution through the on-going constitution amendment.\n\n\u201cThe meeting resolved to support the position that the collection of VAT falls within the powers of the states.\u201d\n\nThe forum also said, \u201cThere is the need for the southern states to leverage the legislative competence of their respective state Houses of Assemblies as well as representation in the National Assembly to pursue its inclusion in the Nigerian constitution through the on-going constitutional amendment\u201d.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said the forum aligned with the larger Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum on the handling of the issues around the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as well as ownership of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe governors present at the meeting were Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Nyesom Wike of Rivers; Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom; Babajide Sanwo Olu of Lagos State, and Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta.\n\nOthers were Akeredolu of Ondo; Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun; Douye Diri of Bayelsa, and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun.\n\nDeputy governors present were Mr. Bisi Egbeyemi of Ekiti; Mr. Rauf Olaniyan of Oyo; Dr. Kelechi Igwe of Ebonyi; Chief Ude Oko-Chukwu of Abia; Mr. Philip Shuaibu of Edo; Prof. Ivara Esu of Cross River and Prof. Placid Njoku of Imo.\n\nFIRS Opposes Inclusion of Lagos in VAT Collection Suit\n\nMeanwhile, FIRS yesterday opposed the request by Lagos State to be joined as an interested party in its appeal challenging the judgement of a Federal High Court that had ruled against collection of VAT in Rivers State by FIRS.\n\nA three-member panel of the Court of Appeal in Abuja had last week adjourned to Thursday, the consideration of an application by Lagos State for joinder after it held that Lagos may be affected adversely if the state was not heard before decisions were made in the matter.\n\nJustice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had in a judgement on August 9 held that the Rivers State government, and not the FIRS, had the right to collect VAT and Personal Income Tax in the state.\n\nPam, in the judgement, restrained the Attorney General of the Federation and FIRS (1st and 2nd defendants) from collecting VAT in Rivers State and directed the Rivers State government to take charge of the duty.\n\nAs a result of the court\u2019s decision, the Lagos State government commenced moves to stop the collection of VAT by the FIRS in the state.\n\nHowever, having failed to stay the judgement of the Federal High Court, FIRS approached the appellate court to challenge the judgement. The service also applied for two orders \u2013 the first seeking to stay the execution of Pam\u2019s Judgment and the second, an interlocutory injunction restraining Rivers State from collecting VAT in the state.\n\nBut because of the request of Lagos State, the two applications could not be taken, as the court said priority should be given to the Lagos application for joinder.\n\nWhen the matter came up yesterday, counsel to the appellant, Mr. Mahmoud Magaji, vehemently opposed the request by Lagos State, claiming that the state has not shown how its interest would be jeopardised if not allowed in the matter. Magaji further faulted the application on the grounds that it breached section 243 (1),(a), (b) of the 1999 Constitution, which forbids a respondent from challenging the judgement.\n\nHe urged the panel to dismiss the application for lacking in merit.\n\nHowever, the processes filed on behalf of the AGF, through his counsel, Tijani Gazali, also in opposition to the Lagos application, were struck out on the ground of being incompetent, having been filed out of time.\n\nEarlier, while moving the Lagos application, the Attorney General (AG) of Lagos State, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo, submitted that Lagos had vested interest in the VAT collection, adding that the decision of the court would affect the state when delivered.\n\nOnigbanjo noted that FIRS, in its appeal against the judgement of Pam, made some allegations against it, saying it would be in the interest of justice for it to be allowed to join in the appeal to ventilate its defense.\n\n\u201cFrom the contents of the appellant\u2019s affidavit, Lagos has been made a necessary party in the appeal by some references to It and for it to be bound by the final decision, it is in its interest that It should be allowed to make defense to allegations against it,\u201d Onigbanjo said.\n\nSimilarly, counsel to Rivers State, Mr Ifedayo Adedipe, SAN, in adopting his processes, aligned himself with the submission of Onigbanjo and urged the court to join Lagos as a party in the appeal.\n\nAfter parties concluded their arguments for and against the joinder application, Magaji urged the court to reiterate its order on status quo ante bellum made last week, restraining Rivers and Lagos from collecting VAT in their respective states.\n\nReacting, Rivers and Lagos states urged the appellate court to rather appoint a Receiver or Manager for the purpose of collecting and keeping VAT collected in the interim.\n\nThe two states, in addition, argued that the order of status quo ante bellum be put on hold in view of the appeal filed against it at the Supreme Court.\n\nAdedipe, arguing orally, urged the court to exercise its power under Order 4 Rule 6 of the Court of Appeal to appoint a Receiver or Manager to take custody of the VAT in the interest of justice to parties in the matter.\n\nOnigbanjo, in addition, urged the appellate court to restrain FIRS from further collecting the tax and replace it with a Receiver or Manager that would act for parties locked in the legal battle.\n\nHe said FIRS, apart from collecting the tax, had been sharing it among the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory FCT, despite the pendency of the legal tussle, adding that recovery of the shared fund would be difficult if the court upheld the judgement of the trial court.\n\nResponding, the presiding judge, Justice Haruna Tsammani, asked the two states to make their request formal by putting it in writing. Tsammani further announced that the judgement of the panel on the joinder application had been reserved to a date that would be communicated to parties.\n\nReport: Lagosians Back Sanwo-Olu on VAT Collection, Open Grazing Ban\n\nEight in 10 residents of Lagos State are in full support of the Sanwo-Olu administration and the state House of Assembly on the passage and signing into law of the VAT law and the Act prohibiting open grazing in the state.\n\nLagosians, according to a poll conducted by Lagos-based FREDDAN Continental Services, a public relations and ICT consultancy firm, believed that domestication of the collection of VAT by Lagos State would improve the capacity of the state government to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people.\n\nExecutive Director of FREDDAN Continental Services, Olufemi Lawson, said the poll was supervised by the organisation\u2019s team, made up of experienced development experts, media entrepreneurs, and data analysts. Lawson stated that the two top issues raised by the poll, seen by THISDAY, were in line with the prevailing subjects of discussion among Nigerians, particularly Lagosians, the largest contributors to the VAT regime in the country.\n\nData generated from the state-wide survey also showed that concerns over the menace of farmers/herders conflicts, occasioned by the now unpopular uncontrolled open grazing of cattle across the country, generated a lot of interest.\n\nLawson said the two issues cited above were at the highest point in the surveys.\n\nHe said the FREDDAN SMS poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday, and over 50,000 residents were contacted through the Short Message Services on major telecom networks spreading across the state.\n\nLawson said the poll found no significant differences between respondents who had largely subscribed to participate before and after the eventual outcome.\n\nLawson stated, \u201cThe poll, which we conducted via telephone SMS, requested respondents, if they are in support or not, of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu proposed bill on VAT and anti-open grazing recently presented to the Lagos State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cFrom a total number of 24,564 Respondents out of the over 50,000 who received the SMS poll, a total of 21,125 voted YES, in support of the governor\u2019s decision, while 3,439 voted NO, against the VAT and anti-open grazing bills, amounting to about 86 per cent to 14 per cent, respectively.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of the poll results shows there is a popular acceptance of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s administration\u2019s decision on these bills and this cut across almost every section of Lagosians.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Investigation indicts IMF MD, Georgieva\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank yesterday announced that it has discontinued further publication of its \u201cDoing Business\u201d report series for 2018 and 2020, following data irregularities uncovered by both internal and independent investigation.\n\nThe bank explained in a statement that following data irregularities uncovered by an internal probe on both reports in June 2020, its management had resolved to pause the next edition and initiated a series of reviews and audits of the report as well as its methodology.\n\nThe Washington-based institution added that after reviewing all the information available to date on Doing Business, including the findings of past reviews, audits, and the report the bank released yesterday on behalf of the Board of Executive Directors, the World Bank Group\u2019s management took the decision to discontinue the Doing Business report.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe World Bank Group remains firmly committed to advancing the role of the private sector in development and providing support to governments to design the regulatory environment that supports this.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we will be working on a new approach to assessing the business and investment climate. We are deeply grateful to the efforts of the many staff members who have worked diligently to advance the business climate agenda, and we look forward to harnessing their energies and abilities in new ways.\u201d\n\nThe bank had in January engaged an independent law firm, WilmerHale (WH) to review the internal circumstances at the Bretton Woods institution that contributed to the data irregularities identified in the Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020 reports.\n\nThe investigation had examined the improper changes to the data for China in the Doing Business 2018 report; Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Azerbaijan in the Doing Business 2020 index respectively.\n\nThe probe also sought to establish who at the bank directed, implemented or knew about the changes to the data and how their direction or pressure manifested among others.\n\nPreliminary investigation by the World Bank had already established that irregularities occurred in both editions of the Doing Business reports.\n\nThe bank in a review further established that China\u2019s position in the 2018 report, released in October 2017, should have been seven places lower -at No. 85 rather than remaining at 78.\n\nThe bank in a statement yesterday stated, \u201cThe changes to China\u2019s data in Doing Business 2018 appear to be the product of two distinct types of pressure applied by bank leadership on the Doing Business team.\u201d\n\nThe investigation further indicted the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, who was called out by the World Bank, her previous employer, for applying pressure to boost China\u2019s position in a ranking of economies.\n\nBut Georgieva has faulted the outcome of the probe.\n\nThe investigation was produced by the law firm which was retained by the World Bank executive board\u2019s ethics committee, the body responsible for ethical matters involving Board officials.\n\nThe findings were shared with the World Bank\u2019s executive directors on Wednesday, and the board authorised their release.\n\n\u201cPublished on October 31, 2017, the Doing Business 2018 report was released at a pivotal moment for the Bank and its leadership: From mid-2017 to April 2018, Bank management was consumed with sensitive negotiations over its ongoing capital increase campaign.\n\n\u201cAmong other issues complicating the process, there was concern that at least one key stakeholder would meaningfully reduce its commitment to the institution, and that other significant countries, including China, were apprehensive about how ownership shares at the Bank were going to be re-calculated in response to increased financial commitments\u201d, the report stated.\n\nThe findings however, hailed the bank\u2019s commitment to investigating the circumstances and motivations that led to the data irregularities in Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020.\n\nBut it added that \u201cthose efforts will achieve maximum positive returns for the Bank\u2019s culture and processes only if the institution endeavors to take concrete actions to ensure that similar irregularities do not occur again.\u201d\n\nIt, therefore, recommended among other things, for formalisation and enforcement the methodology and procedures used by the Doing Business team to collect, analyse, and confirm the data incorporated into the Doing Business report.\n\nThe report also called for the establishment of an authorisation process at the senior management level for changes to the Doing Business report\u2019s methodology or publication process to avoid abuse of discretion by a single manager.\n\nIt reinforced the need to enhance procedures/safeguards to data changes occurring during or after Bank-wide review.\n\nThe findings further recommended further embargoes on distribution of rankings, including not sharing rankings outside of the Doing Business team until the report is finalised.\n\nIt urged the bank to develop and implement procedures for the routine audit of Doing Business data and rankings by an independent party (i.e., external to the Doing Business team).\n\nThe report called for, \u201cfirm procedures to protect the Doing Business team from pressure or influence from Bank senior management, regional vice presidencies, advisory services colleagues, and member countries.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the World Bank in August 2020, stated that over the 17 years of its existence, the Doing Business report had been a valued tool for countries seeking to measure costs of doing business.\n\nIt stated that Doing Business indicators and methodology were designed with no single country in mind, but rather to help to improve the overall business climate, it stated.\n\nIt stated: \u201cA number of irregularities have been reported regarding changes to the data in the Doing Business 2018 and Doing Business 2020 reports, published in October 2017 and 2019. The changes in the data were inconsistent with the Doing Business methodology.\u201d\n\nPointing out that the integrity and impartiality of its data and analysis remained paramount, the bank had further announced immediate measures to address the situation.\n\n\u201cWe are conducting a systematic review and assessment of data changes that occurred subsequent to the institutional data review process for the last five Doing Business reports.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the World Bank Group\u2019s independent Internal Audit function to perform an audit of the processes for data collection and review for Doing Business and the controls to safeguard data integrity.\n\n\u201cWe will act based on the findings and will retrospectively correct the data of countries that were most affected by the irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank has been briefed on the situation as have the authorities of the countries that were most affected by the data irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe publication of the Doing Business report will be paused as we conduct our assessment.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says his govt has adopted sport as national asset\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared his administration\u2019s commitment to use football as a tool for the development of the girl-child, inspiring young people to have rewarding careers in the game.\n\nHe also said his government had since the last four years adopted sports as a national asset.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at the State House, Abuja while receiving in audience, the FIFA delegation led by its President, Gianni Infantino, and the President of Confederation of African Football (CAF), Patrice Motsepe, the President called on the top echelon of the world football governing body to see Nigeria as one of its greatest assets, when it comes to the development of football.\n\nOn women\u2019s football, President Buhari expressed delight that Nigeria has produced excellent role models to inspire the next generation of stars to take up the sport.\n\nHis words: \u201cOur National women\u2019s football team, the Super Falcons are a force to reckon with, both on the continent and internationally. Some of our women footballers such as Asisat Oshoala, who only recently became the first African to win the women\u2019s European Champions League with her club Barcelona.\n\n\u201cRasheedat Ajibade, Rita Chikwelu, Onome Ebi, who is the only African to have played in five FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup Finals, Desire Oparanozie and before them Perpetual Nkwocha, Mercy Akide-Udoh, Nkiru Okosieme and Ann Chiejiene, are globally recognised stars.\u201d\n\nBuhari, therefore, urged the FIFA leadership to consider Nigeria top on its plan for support and investment.\n\nHe also told the visiting FIFA boss, who was in the country for the six-nation Aisha Buhari Invitational Football Tournament, that since 2017 his administration had adopted football as a national asset.\n\nThe President explained that sport was being accorded the highest level of attention possible by the government to enable rapid development of abundant talents in the country.\n\n\u201cI have also approved the unveiling of a committee to draw up a 10-year football development master plan for the country. I expect that the recommendations of this committee will accelerate the development of football. It is my hope that it will further improve the fortunes of the game internationally,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Aisha Buhari Cup (ABC), with the theme \u201cPlaying for Good\u201d, which was on-going in Lagos, President Buhari said the tournament could not have come at a better time.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis Women\u2019s football competition is a novel idea here and I am sure it will be exciting in its execution for our women folk and lovers of football. It is also a confirmation of what we already know about our women.\u201d\n\nThe President, therefore, thanked FIFA for making ABC, a ranking tournament, adding that he looked forward to more countries joining to participate in future.\n\nBuhari, who described football as one of the greatest sources of unity in the country as well as in many parts of the world, said: \u201cOur hearts beat as one anytime our teams are playing a football match. Our youth are always positively engaged, when our national football teams are on assignment. Without any doubts here, football is a major tool of national unity\u201d.\n\nHe commended the enormous work done by the organisation in the development of football, using it as a tool for positive social change and to drive global unity.\n\nThe president pledged support for the latest FIFA initiative, the FIFA Connect programme, which aimed to drive football development at the grassroots using technology and assured it of Nigeria\u2019s active participation in the programme.\n\nEmphasising Nigeria\u2019s huge pedigree in global and continental football, the President said the country had achieved successes in many international and continental competitions while maintaining close, cordial and mutually beneficial relationship with FIFA.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the few nations of the world that has participated in all FIFA competitions, at all the different levels for both men and women. These have opened doors of opportunities for a lot of our young boys and girls, men and women to have rewarding careers in the game,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, said Nigeria, as the leading black nation in the world, was central to all that FIFA was seeking to achieve in its football development plan.\n\n\u201cWe love football and we follow the game passionately,\u201d he said.\n\nInfantino, while speaking, renewed FIFA\u2019s commitment to support the development of football in Nigeria, pledging to strengthen its partnership with the Nigeria Football Federation.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is a big football playing country. We need Nigeria to lead the football movement in the world, together with Africa as a continent.\u201d\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for supporting the development of the game and appealed to him to help FIFA amplify the message of football as a uniting force.\n\n\u201cWhen football is played, there are no divisions in a nation or continent. Football brings people together and to do that, we need important countries like Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We have quite a number of other leaders who have come\u2026 in fact, once you have joined APC, all your sins are forgiven,\u201d he had said.\n\nWith the latest being the defection of the discredited former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode to the APC, SaharaReporters catalogues a number of politicians with corruption cases gradually forming a new gang in the APC.\n\nGovernor David Umahi of Ebonyi State\n\nIn November 2020, Dave Umahi, Ebonyi State governor formally defected from the PDP to the APC alongside members of his cabinet with the claim that the South-East geo-political zone had suffered injustice from the PDP.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had linked Umahi with an alleged diversion of N400 million into private pockets during the 2015 presidential election through an arms deal.\n\nThe governor\u2019s property had also been sealed before he opted to join the APC and have his \"sins forgiven\".\n\nSenator Godswill Akpabio\n\nFormer Governor of Akwa Ibom State and current Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio also defected from the PDP to APC in 2018, claiming it was because he discovered that President Muhammadu Buhari was \u201ca man of integrity and a nationalist.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there were tons of allegations levelled against Akpabio from when he was Akwa Ibom State governor. Akpabio was accused of diverting over N100 billion from the oil-rich state between 2007 and 2015.\n\nThere have also been allegations of his involvement in N40 billion fraud in the Niger Delta Development Commission which is under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nOn August 27, 2021, a former Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah, who recently joined the APC, claimed she joined the party to change the political narrative in the South-East.\n\nOduah, like others, has been under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for her alleged involvement in over N9.4 billion fraud.\n\nThe allegations included a dubious contract for the supply of security equipment to 22 airports across the country.\n\nOrji Uzor Kalu\n\nA former Governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, after nine years of intense legal battle to avoid being convicted for charges of corruption, formally joined the ruling APC in November 2016.\n\nKalu left the Progressives Peoples Alliance for the APC while his prosecution for alleged money laundering, by the EFCC to the tune of N3.2 billion, was ongoing.\n\nAdebayo Alao-Akala\n\nIn 2019, a former Governor of Oyo State, Adebayo Alao-Akala reportedly defected to the APC from the Action Democratic Party (ADP).\n\nThe EFCC had levelled accusations of an N11.5 billion fraud case against Akala, alongside Hosea Agboola, a former Oyo State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters; and Femi Babalola, an Ibadan-based businessman.\n\nThe trio are facing 11 counts bordering on conspiracy, awarding contracts without budgetary provision, obtaining money by false pretences, acquiring property with money derived from an illegal act, and concealing its ownership.\n\nLt Gen Azubuike Ihejirika (retd.)\n\nIn March 2021, former Chief of Army Staff, Azubuike Ihejirika, a retired lieutenant general, joined the APC.\n\nIn 2016, the Department of State Services arrested Ihejirika.\n\nHis arrest was connected to the $2.1 billion arms purchase probe involving the former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki.\n\nA source said, \u201cIt is true that we picked up the former COAS; he is helping us with the investigation into the arms procurement when he was in service, but it is too early to say when he would be released on bail.\u201d\n\nThe former chief of army staff had denied allegations against him.\n\nJoshua Dariye\n\nA former governor of Plateau State, Joshua Dariye, who was convicted of criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust in September 2016 also defected from the PDP to the APC.\n\nThe EFCC had charged Dariye to court in 2007, accusing him of diverting N1.126 billion from the Plateau State government\u2019s ecological fund.\n\nIn June 2018, Adebukola Banjoko, a judge of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in Gudu, sentenced Dariye to 14 years imprisonment having found him guilty on 15 out of the 23 counts preferred against him.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal in Abuja in November 2018 commuted the sentence from 14 years to 10 years and this was confirmed by a five-man panel of the Supreme Court in March 2021.",

          "text": "Since the coming of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration in 2015, a number of Nigerian politicians and political leaders with corruption cases hanging on their necks have found a haven in the ruling party, All Progressives Congress.\n\nThe defection of such political leaders to the APC has automatically stalled prosecution of their corruption cases \u2013 a pattern that negates the self-acclaimed anti-corruption campaign of the present regime.\n\nDuring the 2019 elections, Adams Oshiomhole, a former National Chairman of the APC had announced that those who joined the ruling party would have their \"sins\" forgiven.\n\nHe encouraged more politicians in opposition parties to toe the path of some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who had defected to the APC at that time.\n\n\u201cI am told that there are a lot of very senior people from PDP who have decided to join forces with President Buhari to take the broom to sweep away PDP and to continue to ensure that APC continues to preside all over Nigeria.\n\n\"We have quite a number of other leaders who have come. We have quite a number of other leaders who have come\u2026 in fact, once you have joined APC, all your sins are forgiven,\u201d he had said.\n\nWith the latest being the defection of the discredited former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode to the APC, SaharaReporters catalogues a number of politicians with corruption cases gradually forming a new gang in the APC.\n\nGovernor David Umahi of Ebonyi State\n\nIn November 2020, Dave Umahi, Ebonyi State governor formally defected from the PDP to the APC alongside members of his cabinet with the claim that the South-East geo-political zone had suffered injustice from the PDP.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission had linked Umahi with an alleged diversion of N400 million into private pockets during the 2015 presidential election through an arms deal.\n\nThe governor\u2019s property had also been sealed before he opted to join the APC and have his \"sins forgiven\".\n\nSenator Godswill Akpabio\n\nFormer Governor of Akwa Ibom State and current Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio also defected from the PDP to APC in 2018, claiming it was because he discovered that President Muhammadu Buhari was \u201ca man of integrity and a nationalist.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there were tons of allegations levelled against Akpabio from when he was Akwa Ibom State governor. Akpabio was accused of diverting over N100 billion from the oil-rich state between 2007 and 2015.\n\nThere have also been allegations of his involvement in N40 billion fraud in the Niger Delta Development Commission which is under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry.\n\nStella Oduah\n\nOn August 27, 2021, a former Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah, who recently joined the APC, claimed she joined the party to change the political narrative in the South-East.\n\nOduah, like others, has been under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for her alleged involvement in over N9.4 billion fraud.\n\nThe allegations included a dubious contract for the supply of security equipment to 22 airports across the country.\n\nOrji Uzor Kalu\n\nA former Governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, after nine years of intense legal battle to avoid being convicted for charges of corruption, formally joined the ruling APC in November 2016.\n\nKalu left the Progressives Peoples Alliance for the APC while his prosecution for alleged money laundering, by the EFCC to the tune of N3.2 billion, was ongoing.\n\nAdebayo Alao-Akala\n\nIn 2019, a former Governor of Oyo State, Adebayo Alao-Akala reportedly defected to the APC from the Action Democratic Party (ADP).\n\nThe EFCC had levelled accusations of an N11.5 billion fraud case against Akala, alongside Hosea Agboola, a former Oyo State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters; and Femi Babalola, an Ibadan-based businessman.\n\nThe trio are facing 11 counts bordering on conspiracy, awarding contracts without budgetary provision, obtaining money by false pretences, acquiring property with money derived from an illegal act, and concealing its ownership.\n\nLt Gen Azubuike Ihejirika (retd.)\n\nIn March 2021, former Chief of Army Staff, Azubuike Ihejirika, a retired lieutenant general, joined the APC.\n\nIn 2016, the Department of State Services arrested Ihejirika.\n\nHis arrest was connected to the $2.1 billion arms purchase probe involving the former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki.\n\nA source said, \u201cIt is true that we picked up the former COAS; he is helping us with the investigation into the arms procurement when he was in service, but it is too early to say when he would be released on bail.\u201d\n\nThe former chief of army staff had denied allegations against him.\n\nJoshua Dariye\n\nA former governor of Plateau State, Joshua Dariye, who was convicted of criminal misappropriation and criminal breach of trust in September 2016 also defected from the PDP to the APC.\n\nThe EFCC had charged Dariye to court in 2007, accusing him of diverting N1.126 billion from the Plateau State government\u2019s ecological fund.\n\nIn June 2018, Adebukola Banjoko, a judge of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in Gudu, sentenced Dariye to 14 years imprisonment having found him guilty on 15 out of the 23 counts preferred against him.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal in Abuja in November 2018 commuted the sentence from 14 years to 10 years and this was confirmed by a five-man panel of the Supreme Court in March 2021.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has said he will not support former President Goodluck Jonathan if he defects to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nWike made this disclosure in an interview with BBC Pidgin on Thursday.\n\nNyesom Wike\n\nThis came after a former aviation minister and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Femi Fani-Kayode defected to the APC on Thursday.\n\nThere have been reports that Jonathan may soon defect to the APC.\n\nRecall that the National Secretary, APC Caretaker, and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, had stated that ex-President Jonathan would be given a founding member status if he joins the ruling party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe also said the former President would be allowed to contest in 2023 on a fair ground.\n\nThe APC official disclosed this while featuring as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today on Wednesday.\n\nReacting on BBC, when he was asked if he will support Jonathan to secure the presidency he lost in 2015, Wike said he will only support him if he contests as a member of the PDP despite that they both hail from the same South-South region of the country.\n\n\"When you said pick ticket, from which party? Is it APC or PDP?\" Wike queried.\n\n\"To pick ticket means you're representing the interest of a party. I'm in PDP and I will not be involved in anti-party activities. If he is APC, I won't support him because I'm not into that kind of politics.\n\n\"It is not about ethnicity for me, but about the party. If he joins APC I can't support him,\" Wike added.\n\n\n\nA top source had told SaharaReporters that the President Muhammadu Buhari Presidency had started courting Jonathan since 2020 to bring him into the APC to run for the presidency and succeed Buhari.\n\nAccording to the source, the Presidency cabal wants to make Jonathan the next president as they know he won't investigate atrocities committed by Buhari's regime.\n\nAnd Jonathan, who is purportedly nursing a presidential ambition to complete two terms in office, an opportunity denied him by the APC in the 2015 presidential election, has agreed to play the game, especially considering the slim chances he has in the PDP with the wealth and connection of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nAtiku was the PDP presidential candidate in the 2019 election.\n\nAlthough Atiku has yet to declare interest in the race, he appears to be testing the waters, as some groups showing support for his 2023 ambition have already emerged.\n\nThe source further said Jonathan is also wary of the threat posed by the ambitions of the Governors of Sokoto and Rivers states, Aminu Tambuwal and Nyesom Wike respectively, said to be considering a joint ticket.\n\nHowever, Jonathan was said to have given certain conditions to Buhari's cabal which have yet to be fully fulfilled hence the delay in joining the ruling party.\n\n\u201cAbout a year ago Jonathan started consulting with APC to see how he could join the party. Jonathan realised that his chances in PDP were slim due to Atiku\u2019s influence and opposition posed by PDP leadership, including Wike who is interested in a joint ticket with Tambuwal,\u201d the source had said.\n\nNoting how the move by the Buhari cabal is also kill another bird, which is the ambition of Tinubu to succeed Buhari in 2023, the source added, \u201cBuhari and his cabal had decided to discard Tinubu and started courting Jonathan. Jonathan assisted APC candidate in his state to win election but a court squashed his victory before he could be sworn in.\"\n\nThe source continued, \u201cBuhari cabal knew Jonathan could only do one term, in fact only 2 years constitutionally. They also know Jonathan is a softie who won\u2019t go after members of the current regime.\n\n\u201cBut Jonathan insisted on one condition that monies and assets of his which were seized and frozen by the Buhari government should be returned including, those belonging to his wife, Patience. He told them he had no money and the cabal agreed that they would unfreeze his assets and bankroll him.\n\n\u201cHe has insisted that they must demonstrate good fate before he would take the plunge. And they have started to resolve some of the issues raised by Jonathan. For instance, one of his cousins $40 million was returned via two court rulings.\u201d\n\nRecall that in May 2019, an Abuja Division of the Federal High Court discharged and acquitted Jonathan\u2019s cousin, Robert Azibaola, of $40 million laundering charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How BFree is improving trust in the lending space",
          "text": "A few months ago, Udoma Nseobong took a \u20a630,000 ($60) loan from CashLion Credit. He repaid the weekly interest consistently for six weeks until his final payment.\n\nUnfortunately, he defaulted on his final payment by a day due to unforeseen circumstances. This short period was enough time for Nseobong to be declared by CashLion credit as a fraudster on the run with his entire family to his contacts (OP: ICIR Nigeria).\n\nThis incident is one out of many which indicate that digital lenders will go the extra mile, sometimes using unethical methods, to get their loans back.\n\nNotably, despite the criticism against unethical practices by lenders, some still justify this method of debt collection.\n\n\u201cThere is no defamation of character involved when we trust people we\u2019ve never seen by giving them money and when it\u2019s time to pay they don\u2019t pay,\u201d Titilayo Adetonya, a customer representative for digital lender CashLion told The ICIR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lawful to send those messages to their contacts because we warn them before we send those messages to their contacts and that\u2019s how we get our money,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter many years of unending complaints, on August 17, the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), slammed Soko Loan Company Limited, a Nigerian digital lending platform, with a fine of \u20a610 million for privacy invasion. Soko Loan was found guilty of unilaterally sending privacy-invading messages to the loan defaulters\u2019 contacts.\n\nThis sanction, although a mere warning shot, is the first public attempt by NITDA to address this prevalent issue. The sanction served as a clarion call for digital lenders to use ethical alternative methods to collect loans.\n\nBut what does an ethical alternative look like and how effective is it?\n\nAn alternative approach\n\nJulian Flosbach knows what it\u2019s like to look for better alternatives, as he experienced it first hand when he was the general manager at FairMoney, a Nigeria-based digital lender turned digital bank. He helped grow the company from 8 employees to over 120 employees; and in that same period, Julian also supervised doling out loans to over a million customers.\n\n\u201cIn the early days when giving out a few loans, it\u2019s easy to have a team of five in charge of collections but as things scale up and you have to manage over one million borrowers you start reconsidering a few things,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWhen you have 100,000 defaulters [10% default rate], you have to ask yourself, \u2018Do I want to be a fintech lender or do I want to be a collection company?\u2019\n\nAt one point, FairMoney had as many as 80 employees managing collections in-house; but it quickly became clear that running in-house collections moved the company\u2019s focus away from its business model: giving out loans.\n\nSo the company decided to search for an external solution, and found themselves with the best available option at that time: business process outsourcing (BPO) firms who do customer service for big banks and telcos. But it didn\u2019t take long to see that there were some cracks in the collection process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do collections with operational excellence then just calling customers actually doesn\u2019t always work. These BPOs don\u2019t have customised computer systems for collections, rather they have generic customer relationship management tools (CRMs) or predictive dialers. So for instance they call customers once a week, instead of when the customer actually should or wants to be called. It\u2019s not very efficient.\u201d\n\nThis harrowing experience led him to team up with Moses Nmor (Chief Product Officer), and Chukwudi Enyi (Chief Operations Officer) to start BFree, Africa\u2019s first digital credit collection company. All three co-founders worked together at FairMoney.\n\nThe company saw an opportunity to be one of the less than ten digital credit collection companies grappling for a slice of a $14.4b credit collection market in emerging markets. In emerging markets, BFree\u2019s competitors are India\u2019s Credgenics (recently raised $25m Series A) and CreditMate (backed by Paytm), FLOW in Singapore and Blu365 in Brazil.\n\nIn the space of over a year since it launched, BFree has grown to nearly 460,000 active customers from over 20 lenders in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nWhat does Ethical credit management look like?\n\nLooking away from the approach of other debt collection solutions, most of which thrive on humiliating customers, BFree focuses on ethics and technology in debt recovery.\n\nBFree helps lenders collect loans from their borrowers for a fee. The company charges a commission on the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size and quality amongst other factors.\n\nBFree\u2019s ethical approach to loan recovery is guided by a data-backed belief that the majority of customers take a loan with the intention to repay. Of course, with the exception of isolated cases of fraudsters and fraud victims.\n\nThis approach is validated by the fact that the average 90 days default rate of Nigeria\u2019s top digital lending companies is 10% \u2014 FairMoney (10%), Carbon (11%), Branch (<10%). This means that only about 10% of Nigerians (there\u2019s no central register, but Flosbach estimates about 10-15 million people) default on loans.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the customers (70-75%) fall into the category of folks that want to pay but cannot repay. This is usually due to loss of income \u2014 loss of job or the business went bad or there was an emergency that took away the money.\u201d\n\nThis is a common case in a country like Nigeria where people live from hand to mouth. Without insurance, anything can topple their sustainability.\n\nAt BFree customers are appraised based on two factors: willingness and capability to pay.\n\n\u201cWhen a lender like Branch or FairMoney gives us a portfolio, we assess and underwrite the loan. We take their behavioural data and build two things: collectability score and use case. Then we move these into a collection funnel.\u201d\n\nThis debt collection process basically starts as a self-service platform where customers can log in and see their own repayment plans. At this phase, customers get SMS messages and perform loan repayment activities themselves. This way BFree reduces the number of man-hours spent on making calls and customers aren\u2019t forced to deal with unexpected phone calls during working hours.\n\nIn the case where a customer defaults, BFree reaches out to the borrower to find out why and to also get a promised date of payment (verbal agreement). This simply involves reaching out and asking them for when they\u2019ll be able to make a payment. Based on the agreed dates, automated reminders are put in place.\n\nBFree operates call centres with about 200 agents who are responsible for reaching out to customers. BFree\u2019s goal is to make the process of debt recovery 95% automated in the next few years.\n\n\u201cThe story of collections has gotten bad press with BPOs taking data and threatening customers. Automating this process helps remove the risk of this happening because a bot will never threaten a customer.\u201c\n\nWhat happens when customers default\n\nFlosbach acknowledges that one of the inherent risks of lending is that you have to accept that there\u2019s always going to be default. He believes that the way out here is to accept that some customers won\u2019t repay, and assist customers that will repay as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no portfolio in the world that doesn\u2019t have default. In this case, you have to assess whether it\u2019s a natural default or an operational default.\u201d\n\nIn a natural default, the customers don\u2019t repay because of an unexpected occurrence like a health emergency. When this happens the best case is to re-assess the customer status and agree on a different repayment plan.\n\n\u201cWe should normalize the fact that customers have financial emergencies, the same way nobody blames people for going to the doctor when they fall unexpectedly sick.\u201c\n\nIn an operational default customers don\u2019t repay because of a flaw in the loan collection process. For example, customers don\u2019t get the right repayment plan or they\u2019re not aware of how to make the repayment i.e they don\u2019t know which bank account to pay to.\n\nBFree\u2019s process helps to ensure that operational default decreases as much as possible. So far 95% of customers have rated their experience with BFree as good or satisfactory, a hint that the company\u2019s approach is effective.\n\nAs lending expands beyond an activity being performed by only traditional banks and digital lenders to one that almost every company can, BFree\u2019s value proposition remains relevant.\n\nFlosbach believes that BFree\u2019s ultimate goal is to increase trust in the African lending space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing trust in the financial retail market by decreasing risk and giving businesses a better margin.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

According to Crunchbase, the startup has so far raised $156.7 million in funding.\n\nIn over five years of operation, Jumo claims to have enabled the disbursement of more than $3 billion in loans and reached over 18 million customers and small businesses. It has a client base that includes Uber, Barclays Bank, Ecobank, Tigo, Airtel, and now MTN and MANSA Bank.\n\n\u201cJumo is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for large banks to deploy capital to new market segments,\u201d said Buhle Goslar, Jumo\u2019s Africa CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about bringing our proven business model to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and working with our partners to create positive outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with MANSA and MTN is the first of its kind for Jumo in Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into last year. The recent expansion was driven by a number of factors, which according to Kone make the West African nation an \u201cattractive market\u201d for Jumo.\n\n\u201cIvory Coast has all the characteristics of an attractive market with high growth potential. These include low banking penetration, a large mobile money base, limited access to financing, and high demand for digital lending products,\u201d Kone told TechCabal via email\n\nAccording to the Ivorian telecom regulator, the country\u2019s number of mobile money users rose to 20.8 million as of March 31, 2021, from 13.4 million as of the same time in 2018. The mobile money penetration rate stands at 76.9%.\n\n\u201cIn the WAMU (West African Monetary Union) zone, there is a strong will from the BCEAO (the central bank of 8 Francophone West African States) to improve financial inclusion and financial literacy,\u201d Kone said. \u201cWest and Central Africa is the next frontier for Jumo and the regions are ripe for expansion.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

The result is that access to the internet has become ubiquitous in many of the densely populated areas across the enormous country.\n\nCitizens in Sudan \u201crely heavily on mobile data as the primary means to keep its populace connected to the rest of the world,\u201d says the report.\n\nAlgeria is second-cheapest at $0.51, while Somalia takes the third-cheapest slot on the continent, at $0.60 per 1GB of mobile data.\n\nConsumer telecoms analyst at Cable, Dan Howdle, said countries with the cheapest rates of mobile data have excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure, making it easier for service providers in those markets to be able to offer large amounts of data, which brings down the price per gigabyte.\n\n\u201cOthers with less advanced broadband networks are heavily reliant on mobile data and the economy dictates that prices must be low, as that\u2019s what people can afford,\u201d said Howdle in the report.\n\nSudan, with a population of more than 45 million and at least 13 million internet subscribers is at par with Italy ($0.27), but trails Israel ($0.05), Kyrgyzstan ($0.15) and Fiji ($0.19), in the global ranking.\n\nPhoto by Kojo Kwarteng on Unsplash\n\nInternet data costs per region in Africa\n\nOther African countries that charge mobile internet subscribers less than $1 to browse the web and run mobile apps are Ghana ($0.66), Libya ($0.74), Tanzania ($0.75), Mauritius ($0.75), Nigeria ($0.88), Cameroon ($0.90) and Senegal ($0.94).\n\nThe report, which featured more than 230 countries across 12 regions and compared the cost of 1GB from over 6,000 mobile data plans, also pointed out that North Africa (at an average of $1.53) has the cheapest data plans in the world.\n\nAlgeria (16), Libya (30) and Morocco (45) are in the World\u2019s top 50 while Egypt (55) Tunisia (59) and Mauritania feature in the top 100 global list.\n\nHowever, Egypt ($1.04), Tunisia ($1.09) and Mauritania ($5.56) charge more than $1 for 1GB of data.\n\nKenya and South Africa, with advanced mobile infrastructure and high internet traffic, fall far behind the top 100 list, with charges of $2.25 and $2.67 per gigabyte of data respectively\n\nThe cost of data in these two countries, however, is cheaper than the global average of $4.07. According to the report, South Africa and Kenya are considered competitive mobile markets with the prices of these \u2018wealthy nations\u2019 not necessarily considered expensive by customers.\n\n\u201cMany countries in the middle of the list have good infrastructure and competitive mobile markets, and while their prices aren\u2019t among the cheapest in the world they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be considered expensive by its consumers,\u201d says the report.\n\nSouth Africa and Kenya have rolled out commercial 5G networks in their markets. This ultra-high speed internet, though still in its infancy, is billed to have the potential to drive unprecedented and inclusive mobile data growth across the continent.\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Five ways to halt exit of foreign retailers from Nigeria",
          "text": "Five ways to halt exit of foreign retailers from Nigeria\n\nTop South African retailers such as Mr Price and Shoprite have exited Nigeria, and now Massmart plans to leave its Games Stores. Experts say foreign retailers need to re-examine their approach to the Nigerian retail landscape in order to succeed.\n\nA better approach, experts note, is to understand the regulatory landscape in Nigeria, focusing less on assets of heavy retail formats and combining e-commerce with brick and mortar stores.\n\nThey also recommend building a supply chain network with good local content and sourcing dollars from their head office as practical measures foreign retailers can leverage to navigate Nigeria\u2019s retail sector.\n\nWhile their decision to exit Nigeria may not come as a surprise to many as macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira depreciation and weak purchasing power hurt the retail market, retaining foreign retailers is a way to grow foreign investments, which translate to economic growth and development.\n\nDeclining household incomes and low sales have also made it difficult to operate a successful retail business in a country where spending on food accounts for a significant chunk of household income.\n\nThis is why experts say retailers, especially foreign ones, should understand how to penetrate Nigeria\u2019s retail landscape.\n\nUchenna Uzo, consumer/retail expert and faculty director, Lagos Business School, advises that it is very important to research the consumer culture and regulatory space and tweak operations to match them.\n\n\u201cThey should also understand the regulatory landscape of retail by knowing who the key regulators are, what their demands are, what gets them offended and what gets them on your side,\u201d Uzo says.\n\nUzo further advises, \u201cForeign retailers should also focus less on asset heavy retail format and focus more on the experienced pricing side, combining e-commerce with brick and mortar, they would not have suffered.\u201d\n\nThis is why the retail expert says that having a good supply chain network and understanding the dynamics of supply chain management help too.\n\nAnother challenge faced by foreign retailers is dealing with inadequate foreign exchange.\n\nRead also: Attracting and managing retail investors\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, advises foreign retailers to rely on their group head to source foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cConsidering the fact that they are foreign, they have to look at sourcing dollars from wherever their head office is, like the way some fast-moving consumer goods are doing in Nigeria already.\n\n\u201cThis is better than relying on sources from the Nigerian market because it will frustrate their business operations,\u201d Akinloye states.\n\nNigeria\u2019s retail sector was once a formidable consumer market due to a fast-growing middle class, rising consumer income and urbanisation which made it an attractive retail investment destination for local and foreign investors.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2020, there was a projected $40 billion growth opportunity in food and consumer goods in Nigeria, the highest of any African nation, according to a 2013 article by Mckinsey & Company.\n\nHowever, this potential has not been realised as the sector has been challenged by high inflation rate, unemployment and rising poverty levels.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian retail space has almost crippled to a halt. As a result of that the economic environment has become business prohibitive,\u201d notes Cheng Fuller, a retail expert.\n\nFuller advises foreign retailers to cut down on their range and carry only the basic necessities while focusing on cost reduction.\n\nA 2020 Global Retail Development Index shows that since 2015, total retail sales have dropped to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016, and $135 billion in 2015.\n\nRecent data from Euromonitor International, the world\u2019s leading independent provider of strategic market research, show that for the first time in five years, Nigeria\u2019s modern retail trade market contracted marginally by 5.4 percent to $25.2 billion in 2020 from $26.7 billion in 2019.\n\nAnalysts say there is so much uncertainty in the market and for business operators to make it work they need to fully entrench themselves in this market so that when things evolve, they are able to respond.\n\nYet some new retailers are scouring for potential in Nigeria\u2019s retail market. Burger King, an American multinational hamburger fast-food chain, is billed to start operations by the end of the year.\n\nThe company is expected to employ about 6,000 people (direct and indirect) in the country between 2021 and 2026, other things being equal.",

          "title": "Why mortgage banks still struggle despite N29bn intervention",
          "text": "Notwithstanding their recapitalisation and consolidation plus the intervention of the Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC), Nigeria\u2019s primary mortgage banks (PMBs) are still struggling with liquidity issues.\n\nThe recapitalisation and consolidation, which saw the capital base of the PMBs move from N100 million to N5 billion for national operation and N2.5 billion for regional operation, also dragged down the number of the banks from about 83 to below 40.\n\nExperts say these exercises were expected to serve as launch pads for the growth of the banks. The setting up of NMRC, they add, raised that expectation, but it all seems to be a dashed dream.\n\nAs a private sector-led mortgage refinancing company, NMRC has the public purpose of promoting homeownership for Nigerians while deepening liquidity in the mortgage market by raising long-term funds from the capital market.\n\nAccess to affordable housing finance is still a huge problem to many Nigerians who would rather buy, but have resorted to renting their accommodation. As a result, the rental market has become a \u201ckilling field\u201d where renters are at the mercy of landlords. BusinessDay findings reveal that, as a result of rising costs, especially those of building materials, rents have gone up by over 50 percent in the last 24 months and, according to Bismarck Rewane, CEO, Financial Derivatives Company, rents will still go up in the months ahead, citing poor economic condition that has left more Nigerians poorer.\n\nIn most of the South Western cities, rental homes are getting more and more expensive as professionals and young families struggle to pay exorbitant rents demanded by landlords. This is driven largely by shortage in affordable homes and lack of a functional system that guarantees affordable mortgages for home buyers.\n\nMany professionals struggle with the high cost of living close to their offices, except high-income earners who can afford expensive rents in the city centres. While most families still earn the same salary before and after COVID-19 pandemic, cost of living including food and house prices keep sky-rocketing.\n\nRead also: Nigerian banks grow profit by most in 7yrs despite limited cash\n\nNMRC had raised a total of N19 billion from the capital market to refinance mortgage loans provided by partnering mortgage and commercial banks. It raised N8 billion in July 2015 and N11 billion in June 2018. That was expected to bring vibrancy to the illiquid PMBs who were to on-lend their refinanced mortgages to loan applicants for home purchases. But that remains to be seen.\n\nA mortgage bank operator, who does not want to be named, explains to BusinessDay that many of his colleagues either do not qualify or cannot access the NMRC refinancing due to the interest rate, which is not much different from the open market rate.\n\n\u201cThe original intention of NMRC is to increase liquidity in the mortgage market by raising long-term funds and dragging down interest rate to single digits; but that is yet to happen,\u201d the operator notes, corroborating Charles Inyangete, NMRC\u2019s former CEO\u2019s view that the market was still not mature for single-digit interest rate.\n\nNMRC has just raised fresh funds totalling N10 billion from the capital market, and this plus the earlier raised equal to N29 billion. Kehinde Ogundimu, the company\u2019s CEO, hopes that \u201cthe proceeds of the new fund would be used to refinance existing and conforming mortgage loans.\n\n\u201cThis issuance demonstrates NMRC\u2019s commitment to the provision of affordable liquidity to the mortgage market by attracting long-term funding into the housing finance industry from the capital markets.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes that the new interest rate regime would reduce the rate at which the primary mortgage institutions on-lend to their customers and, in the long-term, substantially drive reduction in mortgage interest rates as well as translate to cost reductions in housing construction finance.\n\nBut worried about the deepening crisis in the housing sector, BusinessDay asks questions as to whether the PMBs are truly deploying their finances they got from NMRC.\n\nAdeniyi Akinlusi, former president of Mortgage Bankers Association of Nigeria (MBAN) and also former CEO of Trustbond Mortgage Bank, says they are. \u201cYes, we are. We are creating mortgages,\u201d he affirms.\n\nMortgages are loans, meaning that they come with interest rates. Typical mortgage interest rates in Nigeria range between 6-10 percent for the National Housing Fund (NHF) and between 15-25 percent for commercial mortgage institutions.\n\nBesides the interest payable, the potential loan seeker must also have a certain percentage of the total amount needed for home purchase readily available. This amount is known as equity and should range between 20-30 percent of the total cost of the home.\n\nSo, in Nigeria, if a home buyer takes a mortgage loan of N25 million at 15 percent per annum interest rate, he would have paid N37.9 million in interest-only over the 15-year period. This is more than the principal itself.\n\nThe trick here is that at 15 percent interest rate, it takes a lender approximately seven years to recover the N25 million he lends out. That becomes about six years if the interest rate is 20 percent.\n\nThis is why, with that sort of interest rate, industry experts argue if there is anyone who can honestly afford a mortgage loan on a steady salary. This also explains why, at 0.6 percent mortgages to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate, Nigeria lags Ghana\u2019s 2 percent, South Africa\u2019s 30 percent, the US and UK rate at 60 percent and 70 percent, respectively.",

          "text": "Nigerian authorities began virtual meetings with potential investors for the proposed $3bn Eurobond issuance today, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nThrough the issuance, Nigeria, currently rated B2 (Negative) by Moody\u2019s, B- (Stable) by S&P and, B (Stable) by Fitch, hopes to raise up to USD$3 billion but not more than USD$6.2 billion.\n\n\u201cThis means that after meeting with investors on September 17 and 20, we could issue on 21 if market conditions are good,\u201d a top official told BusinessDay.\n\nThe last time Nigeria accessed the International Capital Market (ICM) was in November 2018, but had been keenly planning a return to the market as revenues shrink amid bloated budget deficits.\n\nIn order to avail local investors the opportunity to invest in the Eurobonds, meetings will also be held with local investors.\n\nThis is the first time local investors will be included in the Roadshows, and for this reason, a Nigerian Bookrunner (Chapel Hill Denham Advisory Services Ltd) was appointed as one of the Transaction Advisers.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria Redeems $500mn Eurobond\n\nOther advisers include: JP Morgan, Citigroup Global Markets Limited as International Bookrunners; Standard Chartered Bank and Goldman Sachs are the Joint Lead Managers; . FSDH Merchant Bank Ltd was selected as the Financial Adviser; White & Case LLP as International Legal Adviser ; and Banwo & Ighodalo, as Nigerian Legal Adviser.\n\nSince the ICM debut in 2011, Nigerian investors have always participated in the biding process, including banks, insurance companies and PFAs.\n\n\u201cBut the advantage now of having a Nigerian book runner is to allow us to be able to talk to our own local investors here since they continue to show interest. For free marketing, they will also be making inquiries just like the foreign investors,\u201d Oniha had told BusinessDay in a chat.\n\nThe fresh issuance for which all statutory approvals have been received, is for the purpose of implementing the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nProceeds are for the financing of various projects in the Act, the DMO said.\n\nIn addition to providing funding to part-finance the deficit in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria benefits the country in many other strategic ways.\n\nOther benefits include amongst others: to enable an inflow of foreign exchange, leading to an increase in External Reserves, which then help support the Naira Exchange Rate, and Nigeria\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\nAlso when Nigeria raises funds externally, through Eurobonds, it frees up space in the domestic market for private sector and sub-national borrowers. In effect, it helps the sovereign not to crowd out other borrowers in the domestic market.\n\nThe issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria has opened up opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s corporate sector notably banks, to issue Eurobonds to raise capital in the ICM. By so doing, their capital base has been strengthened to provide banking services whilst also meeting regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, Nigeria has a sovereign yield curve in the ICM, extending up to 30 years.\n\nAlso, the local listing of Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds on the Nigerian Exchange Ltd. and the FMDQ Securities Exchange Ltd., have increased the range of products on these two (2) exchanges and their respective market capitalization.\n\nOverall, Eurobond issuances by Nigeria and the investor meetings that precede the pricing, have provided a strong global platform for Nigeria to tell its own story and opportunities available in Nigeria for investors.",

          "title": "Buhari Was At The Fore Of Onslaught Against Igbos During Biafra War, Didn\u2019t Take A Day Off\u2014Presidential Aide Boasts",
          "text": "Femi Adesina, media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has revealed that the President often boasted that he never took a day off in a genocidal civil war he fought on the side of the Nigerian troops until the government troops massacred over three million Igbos.\n\nAdesina said therefore, Buhari is not afraid of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)\n\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Adesina explained that during the preparations for Buhari\u2019s recent visit to Imo State, he had received messages from supporters who told him to prevail on the president to cancel the trip.\n\nThe fears expressed by the so-called supporters may not be unconnected to the sit-at-home order issued by IPOB to the people of the South-East as a sign of protest.\n\nAdesina, however, explained that Buhari who could not be bullied visited the state to inaugurate some projects executed by Governor Hope Uzodinma and enjoyed wide reception.\n\nUnderlining the president\u2019s fearlessness and genocidal tendency, Adesina further informed Nigerians that until the 30-month war between the federal troops and Biafran soldiers ended, Buhari was restless until some three million Igbos, mostly women, and children, were massacred in a genocide.\n\n\u201cA man, who repeatedly tells us that for the 30 months the Nigerian Civil War lasted, he was right there at the front, not even taking one day off. Is that then the person you would scare from visiting any part of the country?\u201d he said.\n\nAdesina wrote on Facebook, \u201cMany were the prayers and goodwill messages that sped our feet to Owerri, capital of Imo State, the Eastern Heartland, on September 9, 2021.\n\n\u201cWhy were the people so effusive in prayers? We were considered as going into unsafe territory, where anything could happen, as President Muhammadu Buhari and his team visited Owerri on a one-day working visit.\n\n\u201cRather erroneously, some people have pedestaled the President as not liking the Igbos. Who, President Buhari? They don\u2019t know the man. Not this man I\u2019ve worked with closely and observed for over six years. He hates nobody. And I repeat: nobody.\n\n\u201cTo make matters worse, a shadowy group had claimed that the President was not welcome in any part of the South-east. I got messages filled with trepidation from home and abroad. Please prevail on the President to cancel the trip. He should apologise to Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, and abort the visit. There could be a bloodbath.\n\n\u201cI only laughed it all off. Who would tell a duly and popularly elected President where to go, and where not to go, in his own country? At the height of the Boko Haram insurgency, he had campaigned in Borno State in 2015 and 2019, respectively.\n\n\u201cA man, who repeatedly tells us that for the 30 months the Nigerian Civil War lasted, he was right there at the front, not even taking one day off. Is that then the person you would scare from visiting any part of the country?\n\n\u201cAnd again, this was a serial Igbo Chief. The Ogbuagu 1 (The Lion Killer) of Aba. The Ochioha 1 (Leader of All) of Igboland, given to him in Ebonyi State in 2017. Also The Enyioma 1 (The Good Friend) of Ebonyi, and Ikeogu 1 (The Great Warrior) of Ndigbo, among others. Is this then the kind of person you frighten from visiting anywhere, particularly Igboland? It doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201c\u2026The visit of the President was a roaring success, and like the Ohanaeze President said, it drove away \u2018the cloudiness of relationship with Ndigbo\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Ogbuagu, indeed, slew the lion of insularity, wrong profiling, and scaremongering. Bring on the other lions!\u201d\n\nThe civil war occurred between 1967 and 1970, after South-East called for secession from Nigeria and the declaration of an independent State of Biafra, which was recognised by some countries.\n\nRecently, several groups have emerged calling for the independence of indigenous nations like Biafra and Odua and break away from Nigeria.\n\nIn June, Buhari wrote in a tweet: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s tweet riled some persons who felt he was insensitive to have made reference to killings in the civil war. His critics subsequently reported the tweet to Twitter and the microblogging site later deleted the post with a comment, \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d",

          "title": "FLASHBACK: From Jonathan To Buhari: Fani-Kayode\u2019s Long History Of Going Back To \u2018Vomit\u2019",
          "text": "The defection of Femi \u2013 Fani Kayode, the former Minister of Aviation, to the All Progressives Congress, APC, has sent tongues buzzing on social media.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nigerian political arena is filled with politicians cross-carpeting, the defection of FFK surprised many due to the former Aviation Minister\u2019s previous utterances.\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello confirmed FFK\u2019s decampment to the APC in February, after he danced around decamping for a while.\n\nWhen Fani-Kayode visited the wedding of Yusuf Buhari\u2019s son, the likelihood of defecting became more apparent. The fact that FFK attended the wedding sparked outrage on social media, to which he responded with missives, referring to those who were critical of him as \u201cfoaming in the mouth.\u201d\n\nClueless Goodluck Jonathan\n\nIn 2014, FFK published a series of write-up on his website, \u201cA President Without Balls\u201d and the two updated versions of the same essay titled \u201dThe Gutless Eunuch and Spirit of the Jagaban\u201d and \u201dThe Gutless Eunuch and the Lion King,\u201d respectively.\n\nAn excerpt from one of the essays read, \u201cAs long as such a weak and uninspiring man (Former President Jonathan) remains the Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces please be ready for more casualties,\u201d he stated about Jonathan.\n\n\u201cHe must pull down every satanic alter that may have been erected in the Presidency and consecrate and re-dedicate the whole place to the Living God.\u201d\n\nWhile FFK was in APC, he was showering encomium on Bola Tinubu, while calling Jonathan all sorts of unprintable names, including \u201cclueless.\u201d\n\n\u201cA President who is as confused and as clueless as the comic character called Chancey Gardner in the celebrated 1970\u2019s Peter Seller\u2019s Hollywood blockbuster titled \u201dBeing There\u201d, he once said.\n\nIn 2015, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode was appointed the Director of Media and Publicity at Jonathan/Sambo Presidential Campaign Organisation, a position where he transmitted to praising Mr Jonathan.\n\nIn 2015, he stated that he \u201crenounced those views about President Jonathan long ago.\u201d\n\nUpon his migration, he started calling APC a party with \u201cJanjaweed ideology\u201d adding that \u201cThe APC is a Boko Haramite party that is for Muslim extremists only and a handful of Christians who really don\u2019t know what they have got themselves into.\u201d\n\nWhen Buhari was sick in 2018, FFK was at the forefront of the \u201cBuhari is dead campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuhari is dead and he never came back from London. Only his body did. They invoked the spirit of Jubril and placed it in Buhari\u2019s body. It is a common ritual among satanists.\u201d\n\nReligion also appears to be a tool that Mr FFK deploys with so much ease.\n\nBigotry statement on Igbo\n\nOf recent, FFK has been a major supporter of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nWhen Kanu was incarcerated in 2017, FFK was one of the main people that visited him in prison and even called him his brother.\n\nBut most people had stated then that what most followers of Kanu may not know is that FFK has a long history of bigotry against people from the eastern part of the country.\n\nIn 2013, FFK published an article entitled: The Bitter Truth About The Igbo. He justified the progrom in 1966 by blaming the Igbos for a number of crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is that same attitude of \u201dwe own everything\u201d, \u201dwe must have everything\u201d and \u201dwe must control everything\u201d that the Igbo settlers manifested in the northern region in the late 50\u2019s and early and mid-60\u2019s that got them into so much trouble up there with the Hausa-Fulani and that eventually led to the terrible pogroms where almost one hundred thousand of them were killed in just a few days.\u201d\n\nThe Igbos had lamented that FFK had no regard for even the memory of Odumegwu Ojukwu, the leader of the short-lived Biafra republic, when he claimed that he \u201chad a long-standing and intimate relationship with Miss Bianca Onoh.\u201d\n\nBigotry against Fulani\n\nFFK\u2019s favourite target practice is the Fulani, he even took it to a bizarre level by alleging that Fulani have sex with cow for sexual gratification and ritual.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani is obsessed to conquer the South and take it from the ancestral owners like they did to the Hausas. The South owns the Pots and oil. It owns the best companies and rainforests. That is what they secretly want and not grazing land for cows,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that when it suites FFK, he exploits his Fulani heritage which he is always keen to brandish.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather, Sheik Nurudeen Sa\u2019 I\u2019d, who was half Fulani and half Yoruba, got married to my grandmother, Alhaja Abeke Sa\u2019 id (nee Williams) who was a pure Yoruba woman.\u201d\n\nHis disdain for Fulani did not stop him from taking a chieftaincy title from the Shinkafi Emirate.\n\nEmbracing Yahaya Bello he once cursed\n\nDuring a spat with Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, FFK did not mince words when speaking his mind.\n\n\u201cGov. Yahaya Bello; when I wrote that this boy was a useful idiot and an accursed slave, some said I was being harsh.\n\n\u201cTruth is that he is worse than that. His mental faculties are non-functional,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nBut as always, times have changed, and since their new friendship which started in Febuarary, FFK has been going out of his way to defend Mr Bello.\n\nLast week, he even defended Bello on the accusation of diverting bailout funds to a private account.\n\nChanging stance on Buhari\n\nFFK once described President Buhari as weak, incompetent, sectional, bloodthirsty, genocidal and wicked.\n\nAdding that \u201cI would rather die than join APC or bow to Buhari.\u201d\n\nWhile this story is still developing, it is possible to start seeing some good remarks on Buhari from FFK based on his antecedent.\n\nMeanwhile, Fani-Kayode had at several fora said that he does not play politics of do-or-die and does not also believe in politics of bitterness and exclusivity.\n\nWhile reacting to the backlash that greeted his association with politicians at the wedding of Buhari\u2019s son, Yusuf, FFK argued that there is no permanent enemy in politics.",

          "text": "The bid by the duo of Rivers and Lagos state governments to stop the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) from collecting the Value Added Taxes (VAT) experienced a setback of sort Thursday at the Court of Appeal, Abuja.\n\nSpecifically, the appellate court declined their requests to stop the federal agency pending the resolution of all legal disputes in the matter.\n\nThe FIRS had appealed the August 9, 2021 judgment by Justice Steven Pam of the Federal High Court in Port-Harcourt, voiding the VAT Act and ruling that states could collect VAT.\n\nBut in separate requests placed before the court, the two states canvassed that the order of status quo ante belum granted September 10 in favour of FIRS to continue the collection be put on hold in view of the pending appeal at the Supreme Court against the order.\n\nIn his oral application, counsel to Rivers state, Ifedayo Adedipe (SAN) urged it to exercise its power under Order 4 Rule 6 of the Court of Appeal to appoint a receiver or manager to take custody of the VAT in the interest of justice to parties in the matter.\n\nSimilarly, Lagos state Attorney General, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), who stood for his state, made similar plea and urged the court to be fair and just in pending appeal.\n\nSpecifically, Onigbanjo prayed the appellate court to restrain FIRS from further collecting the tax and replace it with a Receiver or Manager that would act for patties locked in the legal battle.\n\nThe silk contended that his expressed fear of unjust treatment was hinged on the fact that FIRS, apart from collecting the tax, had been sharing it among the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) despite the pendency of the legal tussle.\n\nBut the three-man panel, led by Justice Hamma Simon Tsanami, asked the two states to formalise their requests by putting it into writing, thus temporarily halting the move to stop VAT collection by FIRS.\n\nTsanami led two other jurists on the panel. They are Justices Bature Gafai and Peter Affen.\n\nAnd further to this, the court reserved ruling in an application by Lagos state government to be made a respondent in the appeal filed by the FIRS against a judgement granted in favour of Rivers state government by a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt.\n\nMoving the application, Onigbanjo argued that Lagos state government had vested interest in the VAT collection and that it would be affected by the court\u2019s decision when delivered.\n\nOnigbanjo said: \u201cI think it is also necessary to restrain the FIRS, because they collect the VAT, distribute to all the states and keep their own 4 per cent.\n\n\u201cIf, at the end of the day, the court agrees with the judgment of the Federal High Court, how do we retrieve the funds that have been shared?\u201d\n\nHe told the 3-man panel that the FIRS in its appeal, made some allegations against the state and it would be in the interest of justice for it to be allowed to join in the appeal to ventilate its defense.\n\n\u201cFrom the contents of the appellant\u2019s affidavit, Lagos has been made a necessary party in the appeal by some references to it and for it to be bound by the final decision, It is in the interest that it should be allowed to make defense to allegations against it,\u201d he further submitted.\n\nHowever, the FIRS, through its counsel, Mahmoud Magaji (SAN) opposed the request by the Lagos state government to be joined, arguing that the state did not show how its interest would be jeopardised if not allowed in the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, the court struck out the processes filed by the Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) through his counsel, Tijani Gazali (SAN), on the ground that they were not competent, having been filed out of time.\n\nAnd consequent upon this, Justice Tsanami reserved ruling after talking arguments from parties, and held that parties would be duly communicated when the ruling is ready.\n\nSouthern govs kick\n\nHowever, the Southern Nigeria Governors Forum (SNGF) insisted states had the power under the law to collect VAT.\n\nThe governors made the position known in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their meeting in Enugu Thursday.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9 read by the SNGF Chairman and Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), the governors resolved to support the position that collection of VAT falls within the powers of the states.\n\nThey also reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal federalism and return of the presidency to the South in 2023.\n\nThe SNGF also commended the southern states for enacting the anti-open grazing law, urging them to implement the law to the letter.\n\n\u201cThe meeting expressed satisfaction with the rate at which the states in the Southern are enacting or amending the anti-open grazing law, which aligns with the uniform template and aspirations of the Southern governors and encourage the states that are yet enact the law to do so expeditiously.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed to encourage the full operationalisation of already agreed regional security outfits, which will meet, share intelligence and collaborate to ensure the security and safety of the region.\n\n\u201cFollowing from the above, the meeting resolved to support the position that collection of VAT falls within the powers of the States\n\n\u201cThe meeting expressed satisfaction with the army of issues around the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and ownership of NNPC by the larger Nigerian Governors Forum\n\n\u201cThe meeting reiterated its earlier position that the next president of Nigeria must come from the southern part of Nigeria in line with politics of equity, justice and fairness,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 read in part.",

If you ask my friend and brother, Governor Matawale here, there are many people within the PDP, who really do want to come over to the APC, I can tell you that I was there and very instrumental when Governor Umahi joined the APC.\n\n\u201cI was there and very instrumental when Governor Ayade did the same thing. I was there and very instrumental when my friend and brother governor of Zamfara, Governor Matawale did the same thing.\n\n\u201cThere are many others, some of the most remarkable men in this country are still within the ranks of the PDP, it\u2019s our job to try to win them over. Now, if you don\u2019t mind me mentioning names, somebody like the governor of Enugu State, the governor Oyo State, and of course, my good friend, the governor of Bauchi State, great friends of mine, and I sincerely hope that they too may end up coming in this direction.\n\n\u201cBut whether they do or not, the most important thing is that we work together as a people, as a country, and move our country together and fight and kill the terrorists and put to shame the foreign elements and I emphasise that word, foreign elements, that want us to end up fighting one another in this country and turning our country into a massive refugee camp,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why he joined the ruling party despite his criticism in the past, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll say that the only constant thing in life is change. You can\u2019t hold me to what I\u2019ve said in the past if circumstances change and I will always bow to superior argument and logic. For me, the primary cause today and let me say this, there\u2019s no way I will renege on my fundamental core values and principles, anybody that knows me will tell you that.\n\n\u201cI believe in certain things; how the country should be moved forward. I will fight for that from within this party to ensure it\u2019s done. I believe in fairness and equity. But the most important thing for us today is we must not allow our country to fall apart based on disagreement and misunderstanding amongst one another.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer-turned politician, was before now a strong critic of the Buhari administration.\n\nHe was also the spokesman of PDP presidential campaign organisation in 2015 during which he made some scathing remarks about the APC and Buhari, its presidential candidate during the campaign.",

          "text": "Barely 24 hours after the hierarchy of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), denied trending reports that alleged killing and wounding of civilians population in Buhari village in Yobe state, the service has withdrawn its hasty denial, saying that it is investigating the tragic episode.\n\nDirector of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet in a contrasting statement within 24 hours explained that: \u201cInitial release denying the involvement of NAF aircraft was based on the first report available to the Air Component which was subsequently forwarded to NAF headquarters that civilians were bombed as the aircraft detailed for the mission was not carrying bombs\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Service, \u201cThe following intelligence on Boko Haram/ISWAP movements along the Kamadougou Yobe River line, an aircraft from the Air Component of Operation Hadin Kai was detailed to respond to the suspected terrorists activities in the area along the Nigeria/Niger border at about 0600hrs on 15 September 2021.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft while operating South of Kanama observed suspicious movement consistent with Boko Haram terrorists behaviour whenever a Jet aircraft is overhead. Accordingly, the pilot fired some probing shots. It is important to state that the area is well known for continuous Boko Haram /ISWAP activities. Unfortunately reports reaching Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Headquarters alleged that some civilians were erroneously killed while others were injured\u201d.\n\nThe Service had earlier in a separate statement averred that the report that its aircraft fired and killed civilians was false in its entirety.\n\n\u201cThis tweet is false in its entirety. The NAF last conducted a mission into Yobe State (Not Yunusari LGA) on 5 September 2021 and it was an armed recce. No bomb or missile was even expended,\u201d the short statement reads in full.\n\nHowever, an international news outlet, BBC Hausa Service reported that dozens of civilians were allegedly killed in the early hours of Wednesday, September 15, 2021, after a military fighter jet mistakenly bombed a village named Buhari in Yobe State.\n\nWhile quoting an eye witness, BBC, reported thus: \u201cthree fighter jets went around the area before one of the pilots dropped the bomb on the civilian population. He added that 5 of his relatives died in the incident.\n\n\u201cRecall that a similar event happened in 2017 when the Nigerian Air Force mistakenly bombed an Internal Displaced Persons\u2019 camp in Rann, Borno State\u201d.\n\nAccording to another online report that quoted Bulama Bukarti, a popular journalist, said: \u201cBBC Hausa reports that many civilians were killed & others injured earlier today when a jet believed to be NAF\u2019s bombed Buhari village, Yunusari LGA, Yobe State. A witness who lost five relatives said \u201cthree jets went around, then one of them started firing in the center of the village.\n\n\u201cThis area is in the northern part of Yobe, close to BH/ISWAP\u2019s area of operation, so it is possible that the jets were on anti-BH operation. Villagers say they are unsure if the jets belong to Nigeria or Niger, but it\u2019s unlikely to be Niger\u2019s given it\u2019s within Nigeria\u2019s territory.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria has called on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to insist on a short transition programme that will usher in a new civilian government in that country.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, stated this yesterday while representing President Muhammadu Buhari at the Extraordinary Summit of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS member-states on the political situation in the Republics of Guinea and Mali, which held in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAnd indeed according to the communique issued at the end of the extraordinary summit, ECOWAS leaders have resolved to freeze the financial assets of members of the military junta, place a travel ban on them, while also demanding that the junta return Guinea to constitutional rule within six months.\n\nIt would be recalled that at the last summit of ECOWAS leaders which held virtually on September 8, Nigeria, also represented by VP Osinbajo, condemned the coup de\u2018tat in Guinea, calling for an unconditional release of President Alpha Conde, and for stringent measures on Guinea\u2019s military junta.\n\nSpeaking at the Accra summit, Prof. Osinbajo restated Nigeria\u2019s position, urging for the unconditional release of President Cond\u00e9 and calling for more pressure to be put on the country\u2019s military leaders to return the nation to democratic rule.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, \u201cit is also important that ECOWAS should simply insist that there should be an immediate return to civil rule.\u201d\n\nCalling for more stringent measures to be taken by the sub-regional body, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cwe must make sure that sanctions by ECOWAS achieve the intended objectives.\n\nThe Vice President restated the call to engage global bodies and Africa\u2019s development partners in taking steps to prevent such unconstitutional change of government in countries on the continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cin this connection, I think we should engage all well-meaning stakeholders including the Africa Union, European Union, United Nations, developmental partners, and financial institutions to join in taking more stringent measures by imposing travel bans and freezing of offshore financial assets of the coupists and their collaborators to ensure that they do return the country to democracy immediately.\u201d\n\nAgain, Nigeria demanded the unconditional release of President Conde and respect for his physical integrity, with Prof. Osinbajo urging leaders in the sub-region to also insist on a civilian-led transition.\n\nWhile he noted that although the military junta in Guinea had started consultation with critical stakeholders towards transitioning the country to civil rule, the Vice President reiterated Nigeria\u2019s stance, condemning military intervention and unconstitutional change of government in the West African country.\n\nThe VP, therefore, called on the junta \u201cto transparently restore constitutional order without delay,\u201d and that \u201csuch a process should be led by a civilian.\n\n\u201cWhile we condemn the development in Guinea, and affirm that no matter how popular the grievance against an elected leadership may be, the forceful seizure of power is an unacceptable assault on the dignity of a free people and their right to freely elect their leaders. We nevertheless must strongly urge all ECOWAS Member States to respect the principles of democracy and the constitutions of our respective countries.\u201d\n\nOn the update of the situation in Mali, Prof. Osinbajo again commended former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan \u201cfor his continued commitment and engagement with the various stakeholders in Mali.\u201d\n\nHe commended the efforts of stakeholders in resolving the situation in Mali and restated the call of leaders of the sub-region to the Malian transition government to strictly respect and follow the electoral time table for transition to civil rule.\n\n\u201cI further call for the continued support and collaboration of all major players in the country\u2019s March towards a successful transition,\u201d the VP stated.\n\nAssuring that Nigeria will continue to closely monitor the situation in Guinea, the VP pledged the country\u2019s support in ensuring that only democratic processes are adopted in changing governments in the sub-region.\n\nAt the end of the extraordinary summit, the ECOWAS communique stated that \u201cAfter consideration of the Report and subsequent deliberations, the Authority decides as follows:\n\n* to uphold the suspension of Guinea from all ECOWAS governing bodies until the restoration of constitutional order;\n\n* to ensure the conduct of presidential and legislative elections within six (6) months in order to restore constitutional rule in the Republic of Guinea;\n\n* to impose sanctions, in accordance with extant ECOWAS Protocols, of travel bans on the members of the CNRD (the Guinean military junta) and their family members and to freeze their financial assets.\u201d\n\nHighlighting Nigeria\u2019s position further, ECOWAS also called \u201con the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations, and other multilateral and bilateral partners to support the implementation of these sanctions; to ensure that no member of the CNRD is allowed to contest in the presidential election.\u201d\n\nECOWAS noted that it would also assist Guinea in the swift resolution of the crisis and in the preparations for the elections.\n\nThe extraordinary session was chaired by President of Ghana and Chair of the ECOWAS, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.\n\nAside from the Vice President, the session was also attended by eight Presidents and 4 Foreign Affairs Ministers representing heads of State, former Nigerian President and ECOWAS Mediator on Mali, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan; the President of the ECOWAS Commission, Jean-Claude Kassi Brou; the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General for West Africa, among others.",

          "text": "West Africa\u2019s main regional bloc has imposed sanctions against the military government in Guinea and those slowing Mali\u2019s post-coup transition \u2013 its toughest response yet to a run of military takeovers.\n\nThe move on Thursday was agreed at an emergency summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Accra to respond to last week\u2019s putsch in Guinea and perceived slow progress towards constitutional rule in Mali following a coup last year.\n\nRegional heads of state decided to freeze the financial assets and impose travel bans on Guinea\u2019s military leaders and their relatives, insisting on the release of President Alpha Conde and a short transition.\n\n\u201cIn six months elections should be held,\u201d said ECOWAS Commission President Jean-Claude Kassi Brou at a briefing.\n\nThe bloc also piled more pressure on Mali\u2019s transitional government, demanding they stick to an agreement to organise elections for February 2022 and present an electoral roadmap by next month, according to the post-summit communique.\n\nAnyone in Mali hindering preparations for the elections faces the same sanctions as those imposed in Guinea, it said.\n\nLeaders who took part in the summit hailed this more hardline stance. West and Central Africa has seen four coups since last year \u2013 political upheaval that has intensified concerns about a backslide towards military rule in a resource-rich but poverty-stricken region.\n\n\u201cI welcome the strong actions of the summit to safeguard democracy, peace, security and stability in the subregion,\u201d Senegalese President Macky Sall tweeted.\n\nCoup leaders in Guinea are holding consultations this week with various public figures, groups and business leaders in the country to map a framework for the transition.\n\nLate on Thursday they said they were also expecting a delegation of regional heads of state to visit Conakry for talks on Friday.\n\nSoldiers behind the September 5 coup have said they ousted Conde because of concerns about poverty and corruption, and because he was serving a third term only after altering the constitution to permit it.\n\nECOWAS already has said it will impose penalties on Guinea\u2019s military rulers unless they immediately release Conde, who has been held at an undisclosed location since the coup.\n\nMeanwhile the putsch in Mali was largely precipitated by a security crisis, which has seen militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State extend their influence across the north and centre of the country.\n\nThe new Malian authorities\u2019 pledge to hold presidential and legislative elections early next year has been undermined by their failure to meet various deadlines, including the start of voter roll updates and the presentation of a new constitution.\n\nThe transition was dealt a further setback in May when the colonel who led the initial coup, Assimi Goita, ordered the arrest of the interim president and then took over the role himself.\n\nGhana\u2019s President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is ECOWAS chairman, had said in remarks before a closed-door session that he hoped the heads of state will help offer durable solutions to the crisis.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, the International Monetary Fund said it was closely monitoring the situation in Guinea and called for a peaceful resolution.\n\nSpokesman Gerry Rice said the global lender had completed fifth and sixth reviews of its programmes in the country in December, and provided assistance to help it to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.",

          "text": "The US and UK are facing growing international criticism over a new security pact signed with Australia.\n\nThe deal \u2013 seen as an effort to counter China \u2013 will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nBut the move angered France, which said it had been \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d, while China accused the three powers of having a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d.\n\nAnd the pact has raised fears that it could provoke China into a war.\n\nThe alliance, known as Aukus, was announced by US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday.\n\nWhile they did not mention China, Aukus is being widely viewed as an effort to counter Beijing\u2019s influence in the contested South China Sea.\n\nMr Johnson later told MPs that the agreement was \u201cnot intended to be adversarial\u201d to China.\n\nBut the prime minister was questioned by his predecessor, Theresa May, about whether the deal could lead to Britain being dragged into war with China.\n\nShe asked the prime minister about the \u201cimplications\u201d of the partnership in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nMr Johnson replied: \u201cThe United Kingdom remains determined to defend international law and that is the strong advice we would give to our friends across the world, and the strong advice that we would give to the government in Beijing.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, but Beijing has increased pressure on the island which it views as a breakaway province.\n\nMeanwhile Washington has sought to quell anger in Paris at the pact, which has scuppered a multibillion-dollar submarine deal France had signed with Australia.\n\nFrance\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called the announcement a \u201cstab in the back\u201d.\n\nHe called it a \u201cbrutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision\u201d that reminded him of former president Donald Trump.\n\nFrench diplomats in Washington cancelled a gala to celebrate ties between the US and France in retaliation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very low moment,\u201d France\u2019s former ambassador to the US, G\u00e9rard Araud, told the BBC\u2019s World Tonight programme. \u201cThe US knew that this contract and this strategic contract were essential French national interests, and the US didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called France \u201ca vital partner\u201d and said Washington would still work \u201cincredibly closely\u201d with Paris.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki shrugged off the French criticisms.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of partnerships that include the French and some partnerships that don\u2019t, and they have partnerships with other countries that don\u2019t include us,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is part of how global diplomacy works.\u201d\n\nThe pact, which will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies, was described as showing \u201cprofound strategic shifts\u201d by the UK\u2019s national security adviser Stephen Lovegrove.\n\nIt means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nMr Lovegrove said the pact was \u201cperhaps the most significant capability collaboration in the world anywhere in the past six decades\u201d.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has accused the allies of having a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d that would hurt their own interests.\n\nThe Chinese state-run Global Times warned of an arms race for nuclear submarines, adding that Australian soldiers were likely to be the \u201cfirst to die\u201d in a Chinese \u201ccounterattack\u201d.\n\nBut Australia\u2019s defence minister, Peter Dutton, brushed aside Beijing\u2019s reaction.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that we\u2019ve seen different outbursts from China in terms of Australia\u2019s position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are a proud democracy in our region. We stand with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific to ensure enduring peace, and this collaboration makes it a safer region. That\u2019s the reality and no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts.\u201d",
