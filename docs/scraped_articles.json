          "title": "Allen Onyema and National Productivity Award",
          "text": "By Philip Egbede\n\n\u201cProductivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.\u201d\n\n\u2014Paul J. Meyer\n\nGreatness is repeated excellence. Success is incremental. It does not come in an avalanche. If you want to create a tide, focus on making ripples not waves. If you make enough ripples, waves will herald a tide. This is the guiding philosophy of Mr. Allen Ifechukwu Onyema; chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace Airline.\n\nWhen Allen Onyema conceived the idea of floating an airline, his primary vision was to create jobs. His secondary focus was to birth a new ideology of excellence in the aviation industry, and his tertiary goal was to put Nigeria in the global aviation map. Seven years down the line, he has created not only the biggest airline in West and Central Africa, but also the largest job opportunities in the Nigeria\u2019s aviation industry.\n\nIt was not a surprise to his admirers that Allen Onyema was among eminent Nigerians listed for the award of National Productivity Order of Merit (NPOM), under the employers of labour category. Other captains of industry in the same category were: Dr. Mike Adenuga (Jnr), Alhaji Abdul Samad Rabiu and Jim Ovia. These are amongst first eleven of the nation\u2019s private sector that have created hundreds of thousands of job opportunities, and need no further introduction.\n\nWhen these quintessential entrepreneurs are referenced as employers of labour, they are very qualified to be rated so. A nation that has her unemployment level at 34 percent and underemployment index is approximately 55 percent, should cherish job creators like Allen Onyema, as a national asset. The National Productivity Order of Merit (NPOM) award conferred on him by President Muhammadu Buhari, recently, was duly merited and an encouragement to do more for this nation.\n\nUsing the platform of Air Peace Airline alone, Allen Onyema has created over 4000 direct jobs and close to 10,000 indirect jobs. He does not just create jobs for the sake of it, but good jobs with liveable salaries, with the capacity to positively impact the employees and their families. Air Peace has one of the best remuneration and welfare packages in the industry for its members of staff.\n\nDuring Covid-19 pandemic, when aviation sector across the world was pummeled and ravaged by shutdowns and layoffs, many airlines across the globe, even in Nigeria, downsized workers and furloughed employees,. Allen Onyema, in his capacity as chairman and chief executive officer of Air Peace Airline, resisted the economic pressure to layoff or furloughed any of his workers.\n\nTo this aviation maven, you don\u2019t throw your members of staff under the bus just to survive economic crisis orchestrated by Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Onyema does not see Air Peace employees as just workers but extended family. He plays the role of a father that will never allow any of his children get drown in the storm for the ship to stay afloat. You can understand why Air Peace\u2019s members of staff are very committed to their duties\u2014 Onyema has given them a sense of belonging.\n\nAs a paragon of patriotism, Allen Onyema\u2019s efforts at creating jobs and promoting the welfare of workers goes beyond his own businesses. As the vice president of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), he has made tremendous albeit unnoticed efforts to ensure survival of the nation\u2019s aviation sector amidst excruciating operating environment, in the last few difficult years for the industry.\n\nHis sacrifices in getting National Assembly and President Buhari to pass and sign, respectively, the Financial Act of 2021, which exempted airlines from Value Added Tax (VAT) and Customs Duties, served as a breather to domestic airlines already hemorrhaging and struggling to stay afloat. Allen Onyema has been at the forefront of managing the aviation fuel crisis with other critical stakeholders, just to ensure that airlines do not bankrupt, which will lead to loss of thousands of jobs in the aviation industry.\n\nAt the same, he has been playing stabilizing role in the sector to find a middle ground between the exorbitant cost of aviation fuel and the price of flight ticket, without compromising safety and flight schedules.\n\nEven when Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) in the midst of controversy over the price of aviation fuel accused Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) of running the aviation industry like \u201csocial welfare business\u201d and urged the Airline Operators to \u201clet people pay the appropriate price for airline tickets\u201d, Allen Onyema, as the biggest investor in the sector, did not buy the idea of transferring the whole burden of high cost of JetA1 to already economically strained passengers.\n\nRather, In one of his presentations during stakeholders\u2019 meeting at National Assembly recently, Allen Onyema argued that if the price of aviation fuel would be allowed to reflect totally on the flight ticket without government intervention and oil marketers making sacrifices, the average unit price of flight ticket (economy) would go as high as N120,000. And this will take air travels out of the reach of many Nigerians, and businesses will be adversely affected, of which can cause job losses.\n\nAnd Mr. Onyema will not want such exploitation to happen to save the industry from total collapse. This is mixing business with patriotism\u2014only an Allen Onyema does it. He is not only in business to create jobs and values but to protect the nation from economic sabotage at the risk of his own life, family and businesses. So, Air Peace\u2019s boss is not only a blessing to the aviation industry cum Nigeria\u2019s economy but to the country as a whole.\n\nHe has also ensured national productivity in sports development. His enormous support for the national teams is unparalleled. Only a few billionaires in Nigeria have shown such passionate commitment to our national sports. Allen Onyema does not invest in national sports because of the opportunities it creates for the youths alone, but for the strategic role it plays in national cohesion.\n\nIt is an honor well-deserved to be conferred the award of National Productivity Order of Merit (NPOM) by President Muhammadu Buhari. This recognition will strengthen his commitment towards aviation industry in particular and national development in general.",

          "title": "Why president Buhari loves Dave Umahi, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "For the second time in the life of this administration, President Muhammadu Buhari visited Ebonyi State last week, commissioned landmark projects, and equally passed the night. Rare, very rare on visits to States.\n\nThe President has 36 Governors to relate with, and possibly contend with. Political party would not matter, as he is the father of all. And good fathers, they say, should not like a child more than the other. Even if they do, they should not show it, for the sake of domestic concord and amity.\n\nBut I can wager that this President loves Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State. Why and how? We will come to that later.\n\nLanding at Akanu Ibiam International Airport in the Presidential jet Nigerian Air Force 001, we continued the trip to Ebonyi in helicopters. And we entered the State through Osborn La Palm Event Centre, Uburu, in Ohaozara Local Government Area, where the Governor hails from. The man has made sure that development reached his own very community, and copiously too.\n\nFrom there, we proceeded to the King David University of Medical Sciences, Uburu, built by the State Government. I had last December written on the state of the art university, with ultra-modern facilities. You wonder how a state like Ebonyi, not earning derivation from oil money, could put up such a showpiece. It is one of the wonders of David Umahi in Ebonyi.\n\nVery significant to me was something that happened as our convoy snaked its way towards the university. About five boys, most likely between ages 3 and 5, stood by the roadside, and were waving at us cheerily. Two of them didn\u2019t wear knickers, and you could see their tiny \u2018things\u2019 peeping from in between their thighs. They didn\u2019t care a hoot if anybody was looking at them. They were happy to see the motorcade, and nothing else mattered in the whole world. They kept waving delightfully till we went out of their sight.\n\nChildhood. Innocence. No bile, no guile, no malice. Those boys obviously knew nothing called Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Nor do they know the Eastern Security Network (ESN). They were just creations of God with pure souls, no murderous inclinations, no corroding thoughts of marginalization, real or imagined.\n\nOh, that mankind could return to the original way in which we were created. What Heaven this earth would be. Make me like a child again. Make me gentle and trusting. Let little children come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom of God. The world as God made it is one thing, and the world as man mars it is another thing. May those boys maintain the kind of heart they displayed, for life. Amen.\n\nIn that neighborhood, President Buhari commissioned twin flyover bridges, 12 kilometers dualized Federal road from Mbu, Enugu State to Uburu, Ebonyi State. And then the eye-popping university building, facilities and equipment.\n\nAlso inaugurated that day were the International Airport at Onueke, including the Airport lounge and five kilometers dualized road. Others were a new Governor\u2019s Lodge, office complex for the Governor\u2019s wife, Margaret Umahi International Market Complex, the wondrous Light Tunnel Flyover, and Ebonyi Shopping Mall, which compares with any other you see in other developed countries of the world.\n\nSo delighted was President Buhari with all he saw, that he declared: \u201cIt has always been a pleasure coming to Ebonyi State. The last time I came was in 2017 in the 2nd quarter of the first tenure of Governor Umahi\u2019s administration. I witnessed the commencement of mind blowing projects. I saw in Governor Umahi a strong desire to change the narrative of the State, and meet the aspirations of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nThe President, at a State Banquet that night recalled that he was given two traditional titles in 2017. The Enyioha 1 of Ebonyi State, and Ochioha 1 of South East.\n\nOn day two of the visit, President Buhari commissioned another befitting edifice, the new Executive Council Chambers, where he also held a meeting with illustrious leaders of the South East.\n\nNow, to the crux of the matter. Why does the President love this Governor, so much so that he has paid two State Visits, and passed the night at both times?\n\nGovernor Umahi loves and serves his people, and that is evidenced in how he has changed the face and landscape of the State. Old, rustic Abakaliki has suddenly become like any other modern city of the world. President Buhari loves infrastructural development, as seen in roads, rail, bridges, airports, and many others round the country. He sees Umahi doing the same thing, and he just loves it. At the time Umahi was still in the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party, it didn\u2019t stop the President loving him.\n\nUmahi is forthright. No beating about the bush. At a time he saw that it was more in the interest of his people and State to be in the party at the center, he joined the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nSaid the President: \u201cI am honored that in the life of my administration, Ebonyi State Government and her people made the right choice to join our progressive party, APC. I commend the Governor for the courage to join the party at the center, and for all his contributions in moving our nation forward.\u201d\n\nFor the courage he displays, the President loves Umahi.\n\nAnother reason. For touching the lives of the people through his projects and policies. Hear the President again:\n\n\u201cYou have done your people proud. I am particularly amazed by the economic development records of the State under your administration, the wonderful network of roads, critical infrastructure and investment opportunities in the State. ..I commend the State for emerging as the second overall best in fiscal performance in Nigeria and for soaring high in fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources.\u201d\n\nTouch the lives of the people. Utilize their money and resources to improve their lot, and Buhari would love you. That is why he loves Umahi.\n\nUmahi got nearly everything he requested for. He asked the Federal Government to take over the University of Medical Sciences, the President acceded. He asked for assistance to buy Airport equipment, the President promised to look into it. He named a number of projects after a normally self-effacing President Buhari, whom I\u2019ve seen turn down such requests, but the President said yes to Umahi. Greater love hath no man than this\u2026\n\nAt the meeting with leaders of the South East, two requests resonated. The release of leader of the outlawed IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, and the ceding of power to the region, so that there could be a President of South East extraction in 2023.\n\nOn the first request, the President maintained a position he had always upheld. The case was before the courts, and the onus was on the judiciary to adjudicate. The second request was purely political, and rested with the political parties, who would decide where their candidates for President came from.\n\nServe the people selflessly. Touch their lives. Achieve results. Be accountable, transparent, make the best use of resources at your disposal. Be frank, sincere, truthful, having the courage of your conviction. And President Buhari would love you. That\u2019s how it is with Governor Umahi.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days!

We are not stopping the strike until something concrete is done,\u201d\n\nAccording to Osodeke, before the current strike, the union had given enough period of grace to enable the government and its agencies to meet with them and to address their demands but to no avail.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

We have put some timelines for some aspects like renegotiation of 2009 agreement in terms of condition of service and wage review.\n\nSo, we are hopeful that by next weekend, the unions will see a conclusion of that area.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the two Co-chair of the Nigeria Interreligious Council (NIREC), Sultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar II and president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Rev Samson Ayokunle urged ASUU and the non-teaching staff unions to accept the president\u2019s plea and suspend their strike while efforts are made to address the issues in dispute",

You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that given his current position, his ambition was creating anxiety among Nigerians and the international community, Emefiele replied: \u201cLet them have heart attack; it\u2019s good to have heart attack.

          "title": "24-Hours After Presidential Directive to Political Appointees to Resign, Emefiele Meets Buhari",
          "text": "\n\n* AGF, INEC, honour court summon as PDP, others join CBN governor\u2019s suit *Court orders accelerated hearing\n\n*FG directs ministers, heads of agencies, ambassadors, other appointees nursing political ambitions in 2023 to resign\n\n*Afenifere hails Buhari, charges him to be decisive too in tackling Nigeria\u2019s problems\n\nDeji Elumoye, Alex Enumah and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nTwenty-four hours after President Muhammadu Buhari advised political appointees desirous of running for elective offices to resign on or before May 16, 2022, and hours after the Secretary to Government of the Federation issued a circular directing heads of government agencies with political ambitions to also resign, the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday met with the president at the State House, Abuja behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nThough he was not forthcoming on details of his discussion with the President when State House correspondents asked for his reaction to the president\u2019s directive that appointees interested in 2023 election should resign, Emefiele merely said he had no news for the reporters, but there would be news later.\n\nHis words: \u201cThere is no news now, but there will be news. You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen further told that international community as well as Nigerians are interested in his position as regards the presidential directive, the CBN Governor stressed that he was not bothered that some people were going to have heart attack, but that he was having fun while those concerned were free to have heart attack.\n\nMeanwhile, there was a new twist yesterday as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and two others joined in the suit filed by Emefiele, seeking court\u2019s determination of his right to participate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThis is just as the federal government has issued a circular directing serving ministers in the cabinet, heads of government agencies, ambassadors and other political appointees of the administration, coveting political ambitions in 2023 to resign from the government.\n\n\n\nAlso, yesterday, the Pan Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, lauded the presidential directive that all political appointees interested in the 2023 general elections should resign their appointments forthwith.\n\nOn the suit filed by Emefiele, the court had on Monday adjourned to Thursday to enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) appear before it to explain why the court should not restrain them from preventing the CBN Governor from realising his political ambition by participating in all the processes leading to the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe summoning of INEC and AGF was sequel to a motion exparte argued by Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, to restrain the two defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise the interest of his client.\n\n\n\nRuling in the ex parte, Justice Mohammed had ordered the CBN Governor to serve all court processes in relation to the suit he filed against INEC and the AGF who were the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.\n\nHowever, when the matter was called yesterday. both INEC and AGF were in court in line with the court\u2019s order.\n\nHowever, instead of proceeding with the case of the CBN Governor, two lawyers stood up to announce appearances for their clients.\n\n\n\nFirst was a Senior advocate of Nigeria, Chief Sebastiane Hon, who informed the court of the intention of his client, the PDP to join as an interested party, which was immediately followed by one John Martins and Olukunle Ebun, who told the court that they were suing for themselves and on behalf of the Save Nigeria our Fatherland.\n\nResponding, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, who did not oppose the applicants joining the suit, undertook to serve the applicants with all processes within 24 hours.\n\n\n\nWhile INEC through its lawyer, Mr. Ibrahim Inuwa, SAN, did not also oppose the application for joinder, that of the AGF, Mr. Dipo Okpeseyi, SAN, did and urged the court to ensure that only proper parties should be allowed to join in the matter.\n\nIn a short ruling, the court joined the PDP, John Martins and Olukunle Ebun as 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants respectively.\n\n\n\nJustice Mohammed in addition ordered accelerated hearing on the matter, adding that while the 1st and 2nd defendants were directed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s suit within Monday and Tuesday, the 3rd to 5th defendants have up till Wednesday next week to respond and the plaintiff, 24 hours to reply on point of law.\n\nJustice Mohammed subsequently adjourned to May 23, for parties to adopt their final written addresses.\n\nJustice Mohammed while warning that the court would not entertain any request for extension of time since all parties have pledged to the accelerated hearing of the matter, also warned parties not to take any step that would undermine the proceedings.\n\n\n\nEmefiele had amongst others approached the Federal High Court for an Order restraining the defendants from preventing or hindering his participating in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nHe expressed the fear that any political party he chooses to affiliate with in realising his political ambition may disqualify him based on the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which had barred political appointees from participating in the congresses and conventions of political parties unless the resigned 30 days to such conventions and congresses.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\n\n\nAmongst the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise his desire to contest the presidential election.\n\nArguing the motion for maintenance of status quo, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Ozekhome had told the court that Emefiele, \u201cis in a delimma\u201d as to whether he can run in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ozekhome, time is of utmost importance, following the fact that timeline for collection of nomination and expression of interest forms ends on Wednesday May 11.\n\nOzekhome in addition told the court that timeline for the primaries and congresses of political parties have been fixed for May 30 to June 1, and unless the court intervened there will be a carriage of great injustice against his client.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe needs the protection of the court, the court needs to ensure that nobody does anything that will hurt him\u201d, the senior lawyer submitted, adding that if the court refused to grant the order for maintenance of status quo restraining the defendants from hindering Emefiele from participating in the primary election under a political party of his choice within this period, the case would amount to a mere academic exercise by the time parties return to the court.\n\nFG Asks Ministers, Heads of Agencies, Ambassadors, Other Appointees Nursing Political Ambitions in 2023 to Resign\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government\u2019s circular, dated May 11, 2022, with Ref. No.SGF/OP/l/S.3/Xll/173, a copy which was sighted by THISDAY, was issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha.\n\nThe circular was addressed to all serving ministers, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, National Security Adviser, Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service and heads of extra-ministerial departments, Directors-General/Chief Executive Officers of parastatals, agencies and government-owned companies among others.\n\n\n\nIn the circular, Mustapha stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had observed and noted the expression of interest and intention by some members of the Federal Executive Council, Heads of Extra-Ministerial departments, agencies, parastatals of government, ambassadors and other political office holders to contest the upcoming presidential, gubernatorial, National and State Assemblies\u2019 elections.\n\n\n\nHe said the president had directed that the affected office holders aspiring to run for various offices in the 2023 General Elections, should tender their resignation on or before Monday, May 16, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe SGF said for smooth running of the machinery of government and the country\u2019s foreign missions, the affected ministers are to hand over to the Ministers of State where they exist or to the Permanent Secretary, where there is no Minister of State.\n\nAlso all ambassadors are to hand over to their Deputy Heads of Mission or the most Senior Foreign Service Officer in line with established practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Heads of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals are to hand over to the most senior Director/Officer as may be peculiar to the organisation, in line with the service wide Circular No. SGF.50/S. Il/C.2/268 of 4th December, 2017,\u201d the circular added. The SGF said the circular and the incidental directives take effect immediately.\n\nAfenifere Hails Buhari\u2019s Directive for Ministers, Others to Resign\n\nHowever, Afenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the directive given by Buhari on political appointees and the promptness of its execution demonstrated that he could be decisive where and when he wants to and on matters that touch his heart.\n\n\n\nWhile conceding that the resignation of those interested in contesting would provide a level playing ground for all contestants, Afenifere spokesman called on the president to apply the same decisiveness with which he charged his appointees to resign also in tackling the myriads of challenges facing the country to avert a slide into anarchy.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe gusto with which the order of President Muhammadu Buhari on political appointees to resign if they intend to contest in the forthcoming elections was carried out indicated that he seems to be comfortable with those other aspects of governance that Nigerians are complaining about because of the pains they are suffering.\n\n\n\n\u201cWere he to be disturbed by and concerned about those things that are bothering Nigerians he would have brought the same swiftness to bear on those areas. It makes it difficult for one to agree with the notion that he does not have the power or capacity to deal with at least some of the major problems Nigerians are battling with.\n\n\u201cHe has failed to deal with them only because he did not consider them as problematic as the rest of us are considering them.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that unfortunately, those who are close to the president and could make him see the challenges realistically failed to do so either because they were afraid or profiting from the anomalies going on or both.\n\n\u201cFor example, what stops the President from providing all that is needed by the security agencies in the country to put a stop to terrorism and insecurity going on in the country? What stops him from ensuring that the Ministries of Education and Labour provide the wherewithal for the smooth running of our universities in line with the proposition that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) have been making for several years? What stops President Buhari from breathing life back into the moribund four refineries in the country or build new ones?\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere spokesman argued that the issue of non-availability of fund should no longer be an excuse, saying after all, his party raised several billions of naira in less than two weeks just to express interests in running for offices.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the ruling party could raise such a huge sum within so short a time, why is government finding it difficult to raise the N200 billion required to make our educational institutions at tertiary level worthy of its name? Between contest for elective offices and education of the country, which should be more important?\u201d, Ajayi asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*As THISDAY checks uncover discrepancies in actual amount, parties reluctant to offer explanation\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications Plc\u2019s claim that it paid the sum of N618.7 billion in both direct and indirect taxes to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in 2021 has continued to raise dusts in public quarters, THISDAY can report.\n\n\n\nOn April 2, 2022, MTN Nigeria, in a statement issued by the company\u2019s secretary, Uto Ukpanah, had said it paid the amount in direct and indirect taxes to the FIRS in the 2021 tax year, making it the largest single biggest contributor to taxes in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThe company added that its total tax contribution to all government agencies was 13.5 per cent of FIRS\u2019 total collection for the year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2021, MTN Nigeria\u2019s total tax contribution to all government agencies including the FIRS amounted to N757.6 billion while FIRS collected a total of N6.4 trillion tax revenue in the year,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHowever, the MTN\u2019s claim came on the heels of FIRS\u2019 recognition of 20 top taxpayers in the country including the telecommunications giant.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, THISDAY calculations revealed that the N618.7 billion tax payment as claimed by MTN Nigeria represented less than 10 per cent of the N6.4 trillion that was reported as total collection by the service for 2021.\n\nHence, MTN\u2019s claim that it contributed 13 per cent of total FIRS collections of N6.4 trillion would mean it actually remitted N832 billion to the federal government in the period in question.\n\n\n\nFollowing the apparent discrepancy unraveled by the THISDAY checks, using MTN\u2019s prior statement, the former raised pertinent questions and sought clarification from both the apex revenue agency and the telecommunications company.\n\n\n\nRegrettably, the FIRS has declined to provide THISDAY with the specific amount paid by the company as taxes but said the figure churned out by MTN does not tally with its own account.\n\nYet, the buck falls on FIRS as a matter of transparency and confidence in the management of public accounts to make proper rendition to Nigerians.\n\nThe development particularly smacks of negligence on the part of the service and requires that both parties unravel the truth.\n\n\n\nSources have confided in THISDAY that the refusal of both FIRS and MTN to do the needful contradicts the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOI) which among other things, forbids companies and agencies of the government from withholding critical information that is in public interest.\n\nObservers also said the attitude of both companies serves to undermine the anti-corruption agenda of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Section 2, sub-section 4 of the FOI Act requires that \u201ca public institution shall ensure that information referred to in this section is widely disseminated and made readily available to members of the public through various means, including print, electronic, and online sources, and at offices of such public institutions.\n\n\n\nAnalysts also said MTN Nigeria, as a corporate entity cannot afford to shy away from the principles of transparency and accountability in the interest of its shareholders and the public in general by detailing the various taxes it paid to government within the year in question.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*As party places fate of contenders in hands of screening committee\n\n*Political appointees drag APC, INEC to court over disqualification threats\n\nAlex Enumah and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThere are indications that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may be walking on political landmines ahead of the 2023 elections following the refusal of some of its serving ministers who are presidential hopefuls to resign their positions 30 days to the party\u2019s primary as directed by the guidelines released by the party before the commencement of the process.\n\n\n\nThis is just as some political appointees who intend to participate in the forthcoming general elections under the platform of the APC have instituted a legal action against the party over disqualification threat occasioned by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe leadership of the party had in the guidelines sold alongside the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms mandated the political appointees to resign 30 days before the presidential primary of the party slated for May 30.\n\nClearly, Article 3(i) of the APC final guidelines for the conduct of primaries, states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates. Any political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe decision of the party to avoid legal landmines may not be unconnected with Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act which mandates political appointees to resign before the election.\n\nWhile the Electoral Act was not specific on whether the appointees should resign after the primary election or the general election, the guidelines of the ruling party was not ambiguous.\n\n\n\nRather than comply, the ministers sat tight following the ruling of a Federal High Court in Umuahia which struck down Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nHowever, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Wednesday, citing \u2018lack of locus standi,\u2019 voided the judgment of the Federal High Court in Umuahia.\n\n\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the three-member panel of the appellate court presided over by Justice Hamma Barka held that the said Section 84 (12) was unconstitutional because it breaches Section 42 (1)(a) of the Constitution by denying a class of Nigerian citizens their right to participate in election.\n\nThe implication of the judgment pending the determination by the Supreme court meant that Section 84(12) subsists.\n\n\n\nIt was based on this judgement that President Muhammadu Buhari gave the marching order to the ministers and asked them to resign.\n\nThe president while demanding the resignation of the ministers, had announced that the Minister of State for Education, Hon. Emeka Nwajuiba had resigned his appointment on April 28, as directed by the party. The resignation letter was forwarded to the president.\n\n\n\nHowever, despite his purported resignation, Nwajiuba failed to channel his letter to the appropriate authority \u2013 the Secretary of the Government of the Federation (SGF) for documentation and public record.\n\nBesides, after the minister submitted the letter, he was still attending meetings.\n\nAnalysts believed that aggrieved members or opposition parties could still explore his refusal to resign properly in the court of law.\n\n\n\nThe analysts were of the view that if the party goes against its guidelines, a repetition of the Zamfara and Rivers scenario might be in the offing.\n\nPresently, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio and Nwajiuba have resigned.\n\n\n\nTheir resignation came two weeks before the party\u2019s primary. The questions on the lips analysts are: Will the APC in flagrant violation of its own guidelines screen all those who failed to heed to its directive as contained in the guidelines? If the party proceeds with their screening, can that not lead to litigation by some party members who would contest their eligibility? Or will the party adhere to the guidelines and disqualify all the ministers and others at the point of screening on the grounds that they flouted the its guidelines ab initio?\n\n\n\nRenowned constitutional lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, was of the opinion that all those who failed to comply with the party\u2019s guidelines which was an extract from the 2022 Electoral Act ought to be disqualified from participation in the process.\n\n\n\nIn his view, resigning now is a waste of time. He went on to say that the operating legal framework was the 2022 Electoral Act until set aside by a superior court which at the moment is not the case.\n\nSo, by allowing the aspirants participate in the process is the APC setting itself up for a replay of the Rivers and Zamfara scenarios?\n\n\n\nHowever, speaking with THISDAY in a telephone interview yesterday, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, said the Electoral Act didn\u2019t provide any timeline for political appointees to resign.\n\nHis words: \u201cThat is the decision of the relevant committees of the party to make. These discussions are not heard by any individual, however highly placed.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I cannot give you an answer. But the only thing I will remind you is that the Electoral Act that provides for these resignations didn\u2019t impose any timeline. It\u2019s important that when you do the stories, to present all information so people can actually get a perspective.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act is a law, an Act of parliament, generally speaking, supersedes other inferior laws and regulations. So usually, any lawyer will tell you that when there\u2019s a conflict between the constitution and Act of Parliament, the act of parliament you know, is subordinate to the constitution.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act didn\u2019t provide any timeline; each person must resign. So these are the issues that the committee will have to grapple with and decide, ahead of the screening, and all of that.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, if the committee, for example, thinks the view that the Electoral Act provisions should apply, then the question you\u2019re asking becomes mute. And that would be a fair decision because, the Electoral Act is obviously superior to any rules or regulations by political institutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not that clear cut. I know, you guys, like yes or no answers, but sometimes yes, or no answers don\u2019t address the issue.\u201d\n\nMorka insisted that bringing Zamfara scenario into focus would be speculative, saying Section 84 does not dictate a timeline.\n\n\n\n\u201cSection 84(12) does not dictate a guideline. It doesn\u2019t say resign a week before or a month before. So if it doesn\u2019t say that, then what the Court of Appeal said is irrelevant to this question you are asking.\u201d\n\nThe party spokesperson noted that the constitution with respect to civil servants says you must resign a month before an election.\n\n\n\nMorka stressed, \u201cSo in other words, if this question is based on the Electoral Act alone, any minister who resigns 24 hours before the primaries is fine. It doesn\u2019t say resign one month, or two weeks or one hour before, it just says resign before. So, at any point before primaries, people are still free to resign.\n\n\u201cBut now the president has given a directive that\u2019s purely presidential and administrative. They are ministers serving at the pleasure of the president.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo he has requested them to resign. So I\u2019m quite sure that they will comply. He\u2019s the Commander in Chief. He has the right to hire them and to demand their resignation. So that is a separate issue altogether.\u201d.\n\n2023: Political Appointees Drag APC, INEC to Court over Disqualification Threats\n\nSome political appointees who intend to participate in the forthcoming general elections under the platform of the APC have instituted a legal action against the party over disqualification threat occasioned by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs amongst whom included a governorship and two House of Representatives aspirants in the suit are seeking for an order of court stopping the APC as well as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from disqualifying them on the strength of their being political appointees and section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nThe aspirants, Ambassador Sodique Abubakar, Lawal Abubakar and Bindir Buba in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/641/2022 are contending that Section 84 (11) and (12) of the new Electoral Act is discriminatory against them and unconstitutional and therefore should not be permitted by the court to be used to disqualify them on account of their mere political appointment.\n\n\n\nIn their originating summons filed on May 11, 2022, by Chief Adeniyi Akintola SAN, the plaintiffs want the court to determine whether being Nigerians covered by sections 66, 177, 182 of the 1999 Constitution could be subjected to any other conditions, rules or guidelines for the purpose of election into the office of the Governor of Bauchi State and House of Representatives respectively by the APC under Section 221 of the Constitution other than the qualifications and criteria set out in sections 66, 177 and 182 of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThey also ask the court to determine whether being card- carrying members of APC and political appointees they could be prevented or barred from participating in its political convention, congress or primaries merely because they are political appointees.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs further sought determination of whether the directive of APC based on section 184 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022, that political appointees must resign their positions 30 days before they can participate in its convention, congress or primaries for the purpose of standing as political party candidates in the coming election is Constitutional.\n\n\n\nBesides, they also asked the court to determine whether section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 was not in conflict with section 84 (3) of the same Electoral Act and whether or not by virtue of Section 1 (1) and (3) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria is not Supreme and Superior to all other legislations and statutes including the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nUpon resolution of the issues in their favour, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees should resign from their respective posts as a result of section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022, was unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\n\n\nThey sought an order declaring as unconstitutional, illegal and unlawful the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees must resign from their positions before they could participate as voting delegates or be voted for in the convention or Primaries of the party.\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs also applied for an order of injunction restraining APC and INEC either by themselves or agents from preventing, hindering or stopping them from attending, participating in party congress, convention or primaries for the purpose of voting or being voted for as candidates in the forthcoming elections and in any congress, convention or primaries.\n\n\n\nIn their 26-paragraph affidavit in support of the suit, the 1st plaintiff, Ambassador Abubakar claimed to be a political appointee and currently serving as Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Republic of Chad.\n\nThe 2nd Plaintiff, Abubakar claimed to be a Special Assistant in the Federal Capital Territory Administration FCTA while the 3rd defendant, Buba claimed he is a National Coordinator, Social Investment Program in the Ministry of Humanitarian.\n\n\n\nThey averred that they have obtained expression of interest forms to contest in the primaries of the APC for nomination as candidates in the coming election.\n\n\n\nThey further hinted that pursuant to signing of the Electoral Act into law, there has been threats that political appointees will be disqualified from contesting primaries of APC because of section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe affidavit deposed to by one Oluwafemi Abimbola, a legal practitioner on behalf of the plaintiffs averred that sections 65, 66, 107, 131, 137,;177 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution covered qualification requirements of aspirants to political posts in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThey claimed that Article 2 of APC Constitution affirmed Supremacy of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution but the same party breached the section with its directive of May 7th that all political appointees must resign 30 days before its primary election.\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs stated that Section 84 (11) and (12) are at the moment standing on their way to achieve their political ambitions and that unless the APC and INEC are restrained from the thread, they will be prevented from participating in the primary for nomination as candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, no date has yet been fixed for hearing of the suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has dared anti-graft agencies that previously investigated him to tell Nigerians if he was found guilty.\n\n\n\nBala, who is one of the presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said this while addressing members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the opposition party and other stakeholders, on Wednesday.\n\nThe governor challenged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Independent Corrupt and Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and other anti-corruption agencies as he seeks to contest for President.\n\n\n\nThe EFCC on Wednesday, May 10, 2017, arraigned Mohammed before Justice A. M. Talba of the Federal Capital Territory, High Court sitting in Gudu, Abuja, on 6 counts bordering on abuse of office, false declaration of assets and fraud to the tune of N864 million.\n\n\n\nAccording to the EFCC, Bala, while in office as minister, allegedly received N550 million as a bribe from the Aso Savings and Loans Limited with respect to some properties in the Asokoro area of Abuja.\n\n\n\nMohammed, however, said if elected, he would not be a northern president, but one who captures the nuanced aspirations of every part of the country.\n\n\n\nThe former FCT minister, who is seeking the support of the committee to emerge as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, expressed the belief that the party would pick the most suitable of the 17 presidential aspirants who have so far obtained their nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cI don\u2019t bear any malice against anybody who investigated me. But I dare anybody to find me guilty because I know my conscience and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still standing here. I dare every investigative agency; I did my best.\u201d\n\n\n\nCiting his record in the past three years in office as governor, Mohammed argued that states do not have to be rich before providing infrastructure for their people.\n\n\n\nHe also noted that he would not be a partisan president only reflecting the desires of the North but all Nigerians who, he said, need good governance, justice and equity.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

When Interswitch entered Nigeria\u2019s financial scene, it was estimated that there were less than 200,000 Nigerians with internet access, with many still adjusting to their newly acquired mobile phones. Despite the existence of other e-payment services that had received operating licenses 6 years before Interswitch was established, Interswitch became Nigeria\u2019s first e-payment service to be connected to all banks. Today, it provides payment rails for Nigeria\u2019s online banking system and is known for its consumer-facing products: Quickteller, an online consumer services platform for bill payments and airtime purchases, and Verve, its pan-African debit card scheme, which is available in 185 countries via its partnership with Discover.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s last funding round was in 2019 when VISA acquired a 20% stake, valued at $200 million, and helped it become Africa\u2019s second unicorn. Even then, its products: Verve and Quickteller, were already selling in 23 African countries and had a physical presence in Gambia, Uganda and Kenya. Today, at a $1 billion valuation, Interswitch is touted as one of Africa\u2019s biggest electronic payments and infrastructure companies.\n\nAmidst conversations about the proliferation of fintech companies in Nigeria and Africa, Interswitch is strengthening its pan-African expansion strategy which includes acquiring new customers and expanding financial inclusion on the continent. At last count, Africa had 350 million unbanked adults and recent data from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA) shows that 70% of the world\u2019s $1 trillion mobile money market is in Africa. It is no longer news that the future of banking is in Africa; Interswitch, a pioneer in the African mobile money space, doesn\u2019t want to be left behind.\n\n\u201cThe evolution of fintech in Nigeria and the broader sub-Saharan region has been driven by the need to solve challenges and barriers that exist within the traditional financial system,\u201d Interswitch Group CEO Mitchell Elegbe said in a statement. \u201cInterswitch was born from the need to develop solutions that match the unique needs of local customers and merchants.\u201d\n\nReiterating Interswitch\u2019s plans to replicate its financial disruption in other African countries, LeapFrog Investments\u2019 partner and head of Africa financial services, Karima Ola, said that company \u201chas been disrupting the cash economy, driving digital payments and promoting equitable financial inclusion in Nigeria for two decades. This investment by LeapFrog affirms the formidable talent at Interswitch, and how well-placed it is to seize the significant opportunity in Africa\u2019s evolving digital payments landscape.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s general elections begin on February 25, 2023. Since the 2019 elections, about 20 million Nigerians have turned 18 and are now eligible to vote. While every Nigerian citizen has the right to vote, logistical obstacles can prevent them from exercising it. One of the most important steps in the voting process can be taken right now, though, and that\u2019s obtaining a Permanent Voters Card (PVC).\n\n\n\nVoters must present a PVC issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Election Day in order to participate in the voting process. In previous elections, PVC registration was an arduous process that required people to queue for days. Now, any Nigerian citizen with access to the internet can register a PVC by themselves online as INEC has launched an online portal for this purpose. Other than registering for a new PVC, voters can also use the site to transfer their cards to a different state or request a card to be reissued.\n\n\n\nThe online PVC registration, which started in June 2021, has a deadline of June 30, 2022. As of May 12, 2022; more than 16 million people have registered. However, INEC chairman Mahmud Yakubu revealed in April that around 45% of these registrations were declared invalid due to incomplete data and wrong or multiple registrations. In some regions, the chairman added, that percentage was as high as 60%.\n\n\n\nTo ensure a validated registration, follow the 5 simple steps below to register for your PVC online.\n\nStep 1: Visit the INEC website\n\nThe first step on how to register your PVC online is to go to the INEC registration portal and select \u201cGet Started\u201d. You will be taken to a new page with a list of services. Click on \u201cNew Voter Pre-registration\u201d. Note: This option is only for people who have never registered their PVC before. There are other options on the site if your card is lost, or if you want to buy update your information for a new card.\n\n\n\nBefore we proceed further, know that you can only register once. Wait for confirmation after submitting your application, and do not make any attempt to register again after that\u2014otherwise, you risk invalidating your registration, because signing up multiple times is considered a crime.\n\nWelcome page when you visit the INEC website\n\nStep 2: Create a portal account or login\n\nBefore proceeding to the registration form, you will be required to sign in to your portal account or create one. Fill in your name, email address, phone number, and create a password, then click \u201cSubmit\u201d. It is important to only use an email address you have access to, as you will receive an email instantly to verify your account. If you can\u2019t find the email, it might have gone to your spam folder.\n\n\n\nIn your email app, you should find mail from INEC CVR Portal. Open it and click on the link contained in it to return to the sign-in page you encountered earlier. This time, click on \u201cLog In\u201d and enter your email and the password you just created. After that, you will be directed to a Declaration page that wants to confirm that all information you will provide is accurate. Ensure to click on \u201cYes\u201d before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail with verification link\n\nStep 3: Register\n\nAfter the Declaration page, you will be taken to the main registration form. The information required for the form is as follows:\n\n\n\nBiodata: name, date of birth, gender, occupation, address, NIN, and nationality.\n\nAdditional information: level of education, disability, maiden name.\n\nResidence: country of residence, state of residence, LGA or city of residence.\n\nBirth information: country of birth, state of birth, LGA or city of birth.\n\nOrigin information: country of origin, state of origin, LGA or city of residence, place of origin (town or village)\n\nPolling unit: This is information about the state, local government and area you want to vote in.\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the page, you will find space for supporting documents like your national identity card or passport. Although this step is not mandatory, it facilitates the verification process by making it easy to confirm your identity. It also enables INEC to link your profile on their database to other databases.\n\nAfter you have this, click \u201cSave and Continue\u201d, and you\u2019ll be led to a fresh page with confirmation that your application has successfully been updated. If you do not get this confirmation, click on the three black lines in the top right corner of your screen to view your application status.\n\n\n\nConfirmation page after successful registration\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Upload Photographs\n\nNext, you will be required to upload two clear close-up photographs of your face: one with a neutral expression, and the other with you smiling. To upload your photos, click \u201cChoose File\u201d and you will be taken to your camera. As soon as you take each selfie, click \u201cUse Photo\u201d, and it will be automatically resized and uploaded. Make sure the photos are clear and well-lit. You\u2019re now ready for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Schedule an appointment\n\nNow that you know how to register for your PVC online, the final step is how to schedule a convenient appointment date to get your biometric data collected. Biometrics are unique physical characteristics you have like height and fingerprints. On this page, you will get a form with a list of options showing the closest places where you can get your biometrics done. These options are obtained from the address you entered when filling out your biodata. There are 811 centres dedicated to biometrics capturing nationwide, with even more being created. You can find a list of every center listed by state here.\n\n\n\nThere is also a list of available times for your biometrics on the portal. Select the one most convenient for you. Biometrics take about 30 minutes to be completed and the officials are punctual. In the event that you miss the date or time for your appointment, you can always reschedule through the INEC portal. Once you\u2019ve selected a date and time, you can then submit your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you\u2019re on your way to becoming an eligible voter. After your biometrics appointment, you will receive a temporary voters\u2019 card (TVC)\u2014proof that you completed the voting process. Keep it in a safe place. When the PVC is ready, you will be contacted by INEC to pick it up at the same center you had your biometrics done. This can take anywhere between 1 to 3 months.\n\n\n\nNote: You must present your TVC in order to receive the PVC. If your TVC is missing, you can reprint it from the online portal. All you need to do is enter your log in details in order to access your form.\n\n\n\nConfirmation page after scheduling an appointment\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira speed wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DSTV or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed after the launch.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptability among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out with it after just weeks of launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 which are created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the index, over 35 thousand transactions have been completed on the eNaira, and it was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, of which 36.9% voted not owning an eNaira wallet.\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% of those that owned a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the entire CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the Project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira *997# will make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet, and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a bank verification number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN, and given that 71 million Nigerians have NINs \u2014 17 million more than the 54 million registered BVN \u2014 more people get access to financial services without going to a physical bank branch.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has been unable to verify NINs, leaving 7.5 million MTN subscribers disconnected.\n\nFacilitating eNaira transactions via USSD also raises the question of who bears the consent charge, a question that stands in the way of the eNaira\u2019s biggest value proposition \u2014 free transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nSafaricom to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafaricom has announced plans to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts for young Kenyans, intended for people aged 10 to 18.\n\nThe telco company claims these customers will be able to access the network through SIM cards registered to their guardians or parents since they do not have the necessary identification to register for a Safaricom line.\n\nRemember that Kenya\u2019s Communications Authority (CA) introduced new standards requiring parents and guardians who purchase phones for minors under 18 to register the SIM cards in the child\u2019s name to protect minors who use Internet and broadcasting services.\n\nWhy? Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools. The MARA Chain will launch later in 2022, giving savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy. MARA\u2019s executive team includes former executives from Amazon, PayPal, Uber, NVIDIA, Founders Bank, Rappi, and more. The company raised a total of $23M from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), Distributed Global, TQ Ventures, Day One Ventures, DIGITAL, Nexo, KuCoin Ventures, Huobi Ventures and nearly 100 other\n\ncrypto investors and angels.

          "text": "Twenty-one companies in Nigeria that are making their entrepreneurial endeavours count against all odds have been listed in a ranking by the Financial Times (FT) among the fastest-growing companies in Africa. BusinessDay was a cooperation partner in the research.\n\nCovering the period between 2017 and 2020, while taking the COVID-19 pandemic into consideration and highlighting the companies that successfully adapted to the resultant challenges, the FT\u2019s ranking showed Nigeria has the second-highest number of successful companies after South Africa with 24 companies. Kenya came third with nine companies.\n\nAccording to the FT, the countries with the highest representations are also the markets that have attracted the most venture capital and where unicorns (companies valued at $1 billion+) and would-be unicorns have proliferated.\n\nThe successful companies were ranked based on their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue between 2017 and 2020, as demanded by the FT and research company Statista.\n\nThe criteria included that the revenue generated by the firm must be at least $100,000 in 2017, revenue of at least $1.5 million in 2020 which must be organic, the company must be headquartered in one of the African countries, and it is not a subsidiary or branch office of any kind.\n\nThe successful Nigerian companies are AFEX Commodities Exchange, Zedcrest Group, Starsight Energy, Kawai Technologies, West African Soy Industries Limited, Commercio Partners, Northern Nigerian Flour Mills (NNFM), Alpha Morgan Capital Managers, WACOT Rice, Field Intelligence, and Tripple Gee & Company.\n\nOthers are FoodCo Nigeria, Global Accelerex, Prestige Assurance, Julius Berger Nigeria, Genesis Food Nigeria, Courteville Business Solutions, RT Briscoe Nigeria, Mutual Benefits Assurance, United Capital and HIS Netherlands Holdco BV.\n\nSix of the successful Nigerian companies are listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\n\u201cIt is a significant accomplishment and recognises the work we have been doing over the past eight years. Although the global pandemic has proved challenging over the past two years, we\u2019ve worked extremely hard to improve Africa\u2019s commodity market,\u201d Ayodeji Balogun, CEO at AFEX Commodities, said.\n\nFurther findings showed AFEX Commodities topped the Nigerian list, posting 4,289.7 percent average growth between 2017 and 2020, and ranked third in Africa. Zedcrest Group, a firm whose growth has been spurred by innovation in the nation\u2019s financial services, was ranked second in Nigeria and fifth in Africa with 1,481.7 percent growth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be ranked on the inaugural FT Africa\u2019s Fastest-Growing Companies list,\u201d said Adedayo Amzat, Group Managing Director at Zedcrest Group. \u201cIt is a direct reflection of the leadership team we have in place, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our team. We\u2019ve been fortunate to extend our business across different verticals of the financial sector over the past few years and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities in other markets as part of our future growth strategy.\u201d\n\nHe reaffirmed the company\u2019s commitment to building inter-connected financial solutions across Africa through technological innovation while ensuring global best practices.\n\nStarsight Energy posted 1,154.4 percent growth to be ranked sixth in Africa. It was followed by Kawai Technologies, which recorded 535.6 percent growth during the period. West African Soy Industries, a firm in the nation\u2019s agricultural sector, recorded 507.6 percent growth.\n\nCommercio Partners, NNFM, Alpha Morgan, WACOT Rice, Field Intelligence, Tripple Gee and Co. all recorded revenue growth of between 170.1 percent and 232.3 percent. HIS Netherlands Holdco BV, FoodCo Nigeria, Global Accelerex, and Prestige Assurance posted growth of between 80 percent and 160 percent.\n\nNigeria\u2019s construction giant, Julius Berger, grew its revenue during the period by 70.3 percent. Genesis Food, 54 percent; Courtville, 50.8 percent; Briscoe, 48 percent; Mutual Benefits, 45.4 percent, and United Capital, 44.3 percent.\n\nSome companies are missing from the list, the British paper says, for reasons that include private companies refusing to disclose their revenue figures. The survey required a chief executive or similar senior figure to certify revenue numbers.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s biggest downstream firms grow profit by 57% despite dirty petrol saga\n\nAnnouncing the list of the successful African companies, FT said: \u201cFrom digitising informal trade to fintech and mining, the inaugural list reflects trends on the continent.\u201d\n\nIt said following the application phase, Statista examined the officially stated revenue data of about 900 companies in Africa, adding that high-profile companies that met the criteria for inclusion were added to the list.\n\nIt said the data were collected through research using official sources, such as publicly available earning presentations, investor relations websites, or annual reports.\n\nAccording to the FT, the inaugural annual ranking of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing companies provides a snapshot of the corporate landscape in a continent where technology and support-service businesses have had to adapt to a radically altered environment.\n\nIt said chief among the recent challenges had been operating within the tough restrictions introduced by many African governments to combat COVID-19.\n\nIt said: \u201cIn the end, outside of South Africa and parts of north Africa, the health impact has been less severe than many feared. But the economic consequences of lockdown-especially in crowded urban settings where many lived hand to mouth-have been devastating.\n\n\u201cMany of the fastest-growing companies, especially in the fintech sector, are those seeking to tap Africa\u2019s unbanked population, or markets that have previously been underserved or ignored. The health and education sectors, for example, spurred by unmet need and rising aspirations, are among those offering most scope for growth.\u201d",

          "text": "Continuous Voters Registration to end soon- INEC \u2026as CSOs charge INEC to do more to improve on the conduct of Ekiti election\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said the on-going continous voters registration exercise nationwide will be ending soon. He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "As anger continues over the brutal murder of Deborah Samuel, a Christian female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Wamako, Sokoto State, Anas Mohammad Sani, who is a personal assistant to the Sokoto State finance commissioner, has asserted in a now deleted post that Ms Samuel was brutally murdered because she was reckless with her tongue.\n\nA pro- Muhammadu Buhari regime\u2019s social media contractor, Zara Oyinye, had taken to her Facebook page to comment on the action of the Sokoto mob who killed the Christian student.\n\nReacting to Ms Oyinye\u2019s post, Mr Sani, popularly known as Uncle Anas Dakura on Facebook, insisted Muslim mob justifiably murdered Ms Samuel.\n\nHe warned, \u201cMuslims don\u2019t take insults against beloved prophet \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 in whatever form.\u201d\n\nJustifying the gruesome murder of the female Christian student, Mr Sani said, \u201cThe earlier our Christian brothers and sisters understand this, the better for all of us. May the recklessness of our tongues never drive us to (an) early grave.\u201d\n\nAfter intense criticism, Dakura deleted the earlier post and made another.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe can only discuss permissibility or otherwise of mob action when we\u2019re alive and kicking. That\u2019s the reason Deborah is NO longer having a stake in the discussion. However, we can all steer clear of mob action if we avoid touching each other\u2019s sensitivities. We can all live peaceful if we respect one another\u2019s beliefs and sensitivities.\n\n\u201cThis is neither the first nor the second time this calamity (of insulting the Holy Prophet) and the resultant (barbaric) mob action is happening. If Deborah had respected herself, she would\u2019ve been in the examination hall by now. No one is supporting mob action because mob can be very wrong and can wrongly label innocent a libel.\n\n\u201cUpon landing in Sokoto yesterday in the morning, my wife who suppose to be at the airport to pick me placed a call telling me that they can\u2019t reach airport because protesters blocked the way at SSCOE. I was so nervous thinking about what kind of a protest could\u2019ve erupted in the most peaceful city.\n\n\u201cBy the very first time I read about the blasphemy, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought no anyone in his senses can dare insult the Holy Prophet in a city like Sokoto. The only thing I said was \u201cI pray they didn\u2019t kill an innocent girl\u201d. I thought she was framed cos mob action mostly lead to killing innocent.\n\n\u201cBut I was disgustingly disappointed upon listening to the voice note. By Allah, I listened to it to see if I can give her words other interpretation. But her words were so clear that no one can direct such an insult to even her father and go scot-free. I was shocked that someone from Kebbi, who schools in Sokoto can be this reckless.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, if we must come together, it\u2019ll be good for all of us to respect one another. I can never disrespect Jesus Christ. I also don\u2019t expect you disrespect my beloved Prophet Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645. That way, we live in harmony and mutual coexistence. Otherwise, we shall continue to live with the evil of recklessness we represent.\n\n\u201cTo the people asking for the heads of the mob, I will NOT say you\u2019re wrong. If the law calls for their heads, so be it! However, my point is even if all Muslims would be killed in the process of protecting the image of the Holy Prophet, the very one that will remain on this earth will still NOT tolerate any form of insult directed at the Holy Prophet.\n\n\u201cSo the best remedy is while Muslims are being educated and sensitized about the wrong in a mob action, our Christian brothers and sisters should equally be educated and sensitized on how dear and holy our beloved Prophet is to us. They should be made to understand that Muslims can give their last drop of blood\ud83e\ude78 to have the image of Muhammad \u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 protected.\n\n\u201cWe all have just one life to live and enjoy. We can make noise on social media and condemn the mob action using the Queen\u2019s English. However, that cannot bring back Deborah back to life. More so, if anyone will repeat it tomorrow, the probability of him being served same meal is 99.9%. That\u2019s the fact about it. The earlier we understand this the better for all of us.\n\nMs Samuel, a 200 level Home-Economics student accused of blasphemy, had complained bitterly over the influx of religious broadcast messages shared to her department\u2019s WhatsApp page.\n\nIn a WhatsApp voice note, the deceased reminded her coursemates that the group was created solely for academic purpose, such as sharing important information regarding tests, assignments, deadlines, examinations and the likes.\n\n\u201cHoly ghost fire, nothing would happen to me. Is it by force you guys keep sending these religious messages in our group? Our group wasn\u2019t created for that, but rather as a notice for when there\u2019s a test, assignment, examinations, etc. Not these nonsense religious posts,\u201d voiced Ms Samuel on her department\u2019s WhatsApp group.\n\nThe voice message elicited the fury of fanatic course mates and schoolmates who found her comment unflattering to their Islamic beliefs.\n\nMs Deborah was mobbed at the school\u2019s security post by angry students who hit her repeatedly with sticks and stones till she died\n\nAtiku disowns post\n\nMeanwhile, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, former vice president and presidential aspirant, had disowned posts she made condemning the brutal murder of Deborah\n\nAtiku, who is running for president on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, had taken to Twitter to condemn the mob action, saying, \u201cThere cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.\u201d\n\nHowever, after coming under threats from some Muslim northerners who threatened not to vote for him in 2023 if he emerges as the presidential candidate of the PDP, promptly deleted the tweet.\n\nSubsequently, the former vice president took took to his verified Facebook page to disown the post.\n\nAtiku in a message on his verified Hausa page distanced himself from the message, claiming that any message on social media that did not come with the initials \u201cA. A.\u201d were not his.\n\n\u201cThis evening I received information that a post was made that doesn\u2019t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without A. A. is not from me. May God protect us,\u201d he wrote in Hausa language.\n\nMeanwhile, the murder of the school girl has continued to generate condemnations.\n\nThe Sokoto Sultanate Council in a statement by Sa\u2019idu Muhammadu Maccido, Danburan Sokoto, its secretary, expressed dismay at the unfortunate incident, and urged Security Agencies to go to work and bring the culprits to book.\n\n\u201cThe Sultanate Council has learnt with dismay the unfortunate happenings at the Shehu Shagari College of Education (SSCOE) Sokoto that led to the loss of life of a female student of the Institution,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe Sultanate Council condemned the incident in its entirety, and has urged the Security Agencies to bring perpetrators of the unjustifiable incident to justice.\n\n\u201cThe Sultanate Council has urged all to remain calm and ensure peaceful co-existence among all people of the State and Nation.\u201d\n\nCatholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, in a statement said: \u201cI have just received with deep shock the news of the tragedy that occurred at the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, leading to the gruesome murder of Ms Yakubu, a 200 level Home Economics student today.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this incident in the strongest terms and call on the authorities to investigate this tragedy and ensure that all the culprits are brought to book.\n\n\u201cThe only obligation that is owed her immediate family, her fellow students and the school authorities is the assurance that those who are guilty of this inhuman act, no matter their motivation, are punished according to the extant laws of the land. This has nothing to do with religion. Christians have lived peacefully with their Muslims neighbours here in Sokoto over the years.\n\n\u201cThis matter must be treated as a criminal act, and the law must take its cause.\u201d\n\nKukah condoled with Deborah\u2019s family, and called for calm amongst the Christian faithful in Sokoto.\n\nTambuwal Shuts down College\n\nMeanwhile, the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, who is, also, a Presidential aspirant under the PDP, has ordered the immediate shutdown of the College.\n\nIn a post, Reno Omokri, a socio-political critic, challenged Tambuwal to rise to the occasion and see that justice is served. He said how Tambuwal handles this gruesome murder will show how he intends to be President if he wins.\n\nDeborah was dragged out from the Security Office of the College where he was smuggled to for safety, by Muslim students who went berserk, overwhelmed the Security personnel, and stoned and burnt her to death.\n\nTwo Students Arrested\n\nThe Sokoto State Police Command in a statement, by its Spokesperson, ASP Ssnusi Abubakar, said two Students have been arrested in connection with the brutal murder. He assured that all those connected to the tragedy will be arrested.\n\nThe sickening video of Deborh\u2019s murder clearly showed several of the killers, and one of them, in particular, who looked straight at the camera, granted an interview, holding a box of matches, and hailed himself for being one of those who killed Deborah and set her ablaze.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has pledged to provide a peaceful environment for Nigerians to function, adding that relative peace has returned to Niger, Kaduna and Zamfara States in recent times.\n\nThis Service stated this at a press briefing announcing activities lined up for the NAF 58th anniversary celebration with the theme, \u201cEnhancing Nigerian Air Force Efficiency in Joint Operations for Effective Response to Contemporary National Security Imperatives\u201d, scheduled to hold from May 19 to 21, 2022 at the NAF Base in Kano.\n\nThe chairman, Organising Committee for NAF 58th Anniversary, Air Commodore Olasunkanmi Abidoye, said the Service in its 58 years of existence has grown into a formidable and respected force within the African continent and beyond.\n\n\u201cIt has also continued to make significant contributions in the areas of internal security, humanitarian and peace-keeping operations as well as restoration and sustenance of democracy on the African continent. It is only rational therefore, to celebrate its existence as well as the laudable achievements recorded over the years,\u201d he said.\n\nAbidoye said the choice of this year\u2019s theme was deliberately aimed at emphasising renewed focus on joint military operations and effective synergy among the Services and other security agencies as well as consolidate on the gains of the employment of airpower especially at this critical stage in the nation\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIt is also in tandem with the Chief of the Air Staff\u2019s vision \u2018To enhance and sustain critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives\u2019.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, to mark this year\u2019s Nigerian Air Force Day Celebration, series of activities have been lined up to enlighten the citizens of Nigerian Air Force efforts in the fight against insurgency, terrorism and other forms of criminality within the country.\n\n\u201cThus, there will be series of pre-event activities taking place simultaneously at Nigerian Air Force units across the country. These activities include Juma\u2019at Prayers and Interdenominational Church Service on Friday, 13 and Sunday, 15 May 2022 respectively. There will also be medical outreaches to host communities across the country. Furthermore, the Nigerian Air Force Officers\u2019 Wives Association (NAFOWA) will also embark on humanitarian support activities to some selected communities in Kano State. All these are geared towards winning the consent and support as well as appreciating Nigerians for their support and goodwill over the years,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said the anniversary will also feature a seminar which is scheduled to hold on May 19, 2022 as well as the pulling out ceremony of members of 35th and 36th Regular Course who recently retired from the Service.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the seminar will provide opportunity for seasoned experts to present papers on air to ground integration and operational efficiency as well as optimizing Nigerian Air Force platforms for effective joint force employment. The focal point of the Seminar is to proffer workable strategies aimed at checkmating various security challenges confronting us as a Nation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, in a question and answer session, said the outcome of the seminar will be scrutinised and implemented to checkmate the fluid security threats.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the past two weeks or so we have seen a semblance of peace in Niger, Kaduna and Zamfara States.\n\nWe are looking for workable strategies and solutions, the good thing with this Seminar is that all our operational commanders are going to be there.The outcome will be implemented, what we have in the AFN is the Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Oladayo Amao gets things done,this is the new airforce, we want to get things done,we want to provide safe environment for Nigerians to go about their businesses even I its going to take us a year, 2 or 10 years, the focus is that we have to give Nigerians that peaceful environment to function.\u201d\n\nOther activities he said are a golf kitty which will be held in Kano while other sporting activities will take place simultaneously in all Nigerian Air Force units across the country on Friday, May 20, 2022.\n\nStill on Friday, May 20, 2022, there will be a Re-union Night to honour some retired senior officers of the Nigerian Air Force after many years of meritorious service to the country.\n\nHe said the activities marking the Nigerian Air Force Day Celebration is expected to end on Saturday, May 21, 2022 with a ceremonial parade, symbolic flypast, Research and Development (R&D) exhibition and photo gallery display.",

heading toward environmental disaster unless humans change their negative customs, said about 83% of global citizens see this, and it\u2019s not seen in some areas across the globe.\n\nShe stated that more than three quarters of people are experiencing impacts of climate change, not only in the country, but in a specific region and environment that people lived in, which is an embodiment to the globe.\n\nMrs Bailey noted that about 90% of people in areas of South America, experience flooding, hurricanes, extreme temperatures, and the disrupted weather patterns being faced by so many people which is affecting their ability to work, their homes with so many consequences.\n\nShe however explained that in the global trends survey, attitudes toward religion, politics, healthcare and education, even the climate emergency, are the top values on the planet that affect humanity in their day to day dealing.\n\nShe expressed concern that global warming is present in most people\u2019s

some instances, over the last seven years, consumers and citizens could take into account actions that are very little but increase their behaviours regarding the environment.\n\nHe stated that sustainability conundrum for tobacco is primarily around higher risk cigarettes versus reduced risks from products, adding that engagement is really the way to go and that there are difficult

products\u201d, he added.\n\nOn the question of public health and skepticism of non-governmental organizations around the low risk products, Bloomquist said it was apt to believe that the tobacco industry is concerned about their consumers\u2019 health.\n\nHe reasoned that only when the industry stops selling combustible cigarettes will they believe the innovative strides being recorded by the reduced risk products from a commercial point of view and also in managing the tobacco conundrum.\n\nHe argued that the sustainability conundrum is compounded by the recent changes in the investment environment as well as the rising interest rates that lead to galloping inflation which makes industries paying dividends look increasingly attractive.\n\nBloomquist also reiterated that the sustainability efforts are mostly important in the transition of the tobacco leaf farmers with the sustainable farming practices, and in giving them a future as tobacco leaf merchants.\n\nHe emphasised that it is important for stakeholders to focus on wholistic engagement, instead of exclusion, and that the evidnece on investment side supports this based on recent studies.\n\nHe also asserted that the reduced risks and all the legal channels have an awful lot of misinformation because some agencies and entities are actively working against it, which is harmful to those consumers who would continued smoking.\n\nHe said to ensure willing consumers across both high and middle income, and low and middle income countries, have access, it was imperatives to make case for those

The IDFP is struggling in actualizing intercultural and interreligious dialogues for a mutual harmony in the country. And this has helped in preventing and/or mitigating sectarian and interreligious conflicts.\n\n\u201cAnd this interreligious cooperation eases and diffuses tensions, and it always makes a difference in safeguarding the lives and property of the citizens. This press conference is hinged on the need to use interfaith dialogue as a tool to remedy the existing challenges of the country.\n\n\u201cThe exercise of learning about other faiths that are different from ours brings about respectful coexistence with those whose faiths, customs, and worldviews are different from ours.\n\n\u201cWhen people of different faiths come to a mutual understanding, they will respect, live and cooperate with each other in spite of their differences; hence the key to a productive democracy is to encourage interfaith communication.\n\n\u201cThis is a reminder of the urgent need for all hands to be on deck to ensure we salvage Nigeria from the myriad of these challenges occasioned by conflicts, insecurity, poverty and divisions confronting us in this country, as we need a secured and stabilized country to make meaningful progress, and to provide a better and safe space for all her citizens.\n\n\u201cContrary to the wrong notion being held in some quarters, Interfaith dialogue does not aim at changing other people\u2019s religions or faiths, rather, it seeks to find common ground between adherents of religions, by focusing on communities, and, through harmonious and peaceful interactions find solutions to many of our common problems,\u201d the group said adding that Interfaith dialogue has the potential to unlock the power of religious traditions and provide the inspiration, guidance and validation necessary for people to move towards non-violent means of conflict resolution.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions from journalists, the co-chairman of IDFP, Bishop Sunday Onuoha, said without peace, the 2023 general elections might not hold.",

          "text": "Ten ministers have resigned from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to pursue their ambition for elective offices in 2023.\n\nThose involved are ministers of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige.\n\nOthers are the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, the Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Tayo Alasoadura, and the Minister of State (Education), Emeka Nwajiuba.\n\nHowever, all the leaving ministers except Nwajiuba attended a valedictory session that took place at the Presidential Villa today.\n\nSpeaking at the event on Friday, President Muhammadu Buhari affirmed that a significant number of them have been sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President.\n\nBuhari said: \u201dI have no doubt that if the next President emerges from among former members of this cabinet, like any other aspirant, ample competence and outstanding service delivery would be on display. This will be part of our legacies to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe President commended the departing public officers for serving the nation sacrificially \u201dwith dignity and honor\u201d.\n\nBuhari had at the last FEC meeting on Wednesday, May 11, 2022, directed that all Ministers and other political appointees who aspire to contest for elective offices in the 2023 General Elections should resign from their current appointments.\n\nSpeaking today, President Buhari said: \u201dI note that some have complied while others are in the process of doing so.\n\n\u201dI would like to use this opportunity to commend your decision and courage to contest for elective offices and your compliance with my directive.\n\n\u201dI also wish to thank you for your invaluable services to this nation through your contributions as Cabinet members.\n\n\u201dI wish you success in the upcoming elections and in your future endeavours.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the ministers that looking back as the head of the team over the years, he had fond memories of incisive and robust discussions during cabinet meetings, rendering of performance reports during special sessions, and presidential retreats.\n\n\u201dIn 2015, citizens of this country overwhelmingly voted for me to become the President of this nation on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201dSelecting members of the Cabinet went through a careful process so that the best and most competent could emerge. The performance of that class of 2015 proved me right.\n\n\u201dIn 2019, Nigerians similarly re-elected me as President. Again the selection went through another meticulous process.\n\n\u201dThat re-election was significant because it served as a referendum on our performance during the first term and it inspired me to bring back some of the members of the first cabinet either to their old Ministries or re-assigned to other sectors.\n\n\u201dNew Members were also brought on board to inject fresh energies, skills and ideas to enhance the execution of government\u2019s programs and policies.\n\n\u201dWith these and much more, I am happy to note that a significant number of cabinet members have become sufficiently equipped to aspire to higher elective offices, including the Office of the President. This shows the impact of the experience gathered while serving as members of the Federal Executive Council,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President acknowledged that prior to some of them joining his cabinet; they had made their marks in other areas as governors, legislators, entrepreneurs, and core professionals.\n\nHe added that the experience and expertise they brought on board have significantly resulted in enormous development in various sectors and the accomplishment of government programmes.\n\n\u201dThese include infrastructure, agriculture, health systems, financial management, administration of justice, building social safety net systems,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that the departure of some cabinet members has undoubtedly created a vacuum that should be filled, the President said appointments would be made without delay so that the business of governance will not suffer.\n\nPresident Buhari urged the remaining members of the cabinet to show more diligence, resilience, and commitment to serve Nigerians better, saying \u2018\u2018the journey to the finish line is still very far \u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201dLike always, there will be challenges to address, programmes to deliver, and policies to implement.\n\n\u201dYou must therefore brace up for more work and target increased accomplishments.\n\n\u201dThe determination to leave important legacies for Nigerians should never be compromised,\u201d the President told members of his cabinet.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the outgoing ministers, Akpabio thanked the President for giving them the opportunity to serve and contribute their quota to nation-building.\n\nHe described working with the President as a \u2018\u2018fantastic and knowledgeable experience,\u2019\u2019 adding that as they step aside they will continue to be great disciples of Buhari.\n\n\u201dAs we step aside from FEC, I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism.\n\n\u201dI want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the Minister of Information and Culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, administrative sagacity to Nigerians, \u201d he said.\n\nThe Niger Delta Minister told the President that his interactions with colleagues leaving the cabinet was like the story of the Spanish play of \u2018\u2018sadness and joy.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201dSadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a Father and learning from him; joy because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country. \u201d\n\nLauding the President\u2019s deep patriotism, Akpabio said he is the \u201dbest president Nigeria could ever have had at a time of difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe prayed God Almighty to grant the President a successful tenure and protect his family, adding:\n\n\u201dMay one of us succeed you in order to continue the good legacies you have laid on the ground. We have seen and know your vision. We know where you want the country to be.\u201d",
          "summary": "Ten ministers have resigned from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to pursue their ambition for elective offices in 2023.\nBuhari had at the last FEC meeting on Wednesday, May 11, 2022, directed that all Ministers and other political appointees who aspire to contest for elective offices in the 2023 General Elections should resign from their current appointments.\n\u201dI would like to use this opportunity to commend your decision and courage to contest for elective offices and your compliance with my directive.\n\u201dI also wish to thank you for your invaluable services to this nation through your contributions as Cabinet members.\n\u201dThe determination to leave important legacies for Nigerians should never be compromised,\u201d the President told members of his cabinet.",

          "text": "A governorship aspirant and two House of Representatives aspirants have dragged the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before a Federal High Court in Abuja over threats to disqualify them in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe aspirants are the immediate past Chief of Air Staff Ambassador Sodique Baba Abubakar, Sodique Lawal Abubakar and Bindir Umar Buba, who are all praying the court to stop APC and INEC from disqualifying them on the strength of their being political appointees.\n\nThey also urged the court to void section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 which directs political appointees to resign 30 days before party primaries.\n\nThe suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/641/2022, was instituted on their behalf by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Adeniyi Akintola.\n\nThe three plaintiffs are contending that section 84 (11) and (12) of the new Electoral Act was discriminatory against them and unconstitutional and therefore should not be permitted by the court to be used to disqualify them on account of their mere political appointments.\n\nIn their originating summons filed May 11, the plaintiffs prayed the court \u201cto determine whether being Nigerians covered by sections 66, 177, 182 of the 1999 Constitution, they can be subjected to any other conditions, rules or guidelines for the purpose of election into the office of the Governor of Bauchi State and House of Representatives respectively by APC under section 221 of the Constitution other than the qualifications and criteria set out in sections 66, 177 and 182 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThey also asked the court to determine whether being card carrying members of APC and political appointees, they can be prevented or barred from participating in its political Convention, Congress or Primaries merely because they are political appointees.\n\nThey further sought determination of whether the directive of APC based on section 184 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 that political appointees must resign their positions 30 days before they can participate in its Convention, Congress or Primaries for the purpose of standing as political party candidates in the coming election was constitutional.\n\nBesides, they also asked the court to determine whether section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 was not in conflict with section 84 (3) of the same Electoral Act and whether or not by virtue of section 1 (1) and (3) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, the Constitution was not Supreme and Superior to all other legislations and statutes, including the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nUpon resolution of the issues in their favour, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees should resign from their respective posts as a result of section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 was unconditional and therefore null and void.\n\nThey sought order declaring as unconstitutional, illegal and unlawful the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees must resign from their positions before they can participate as voting delegates or be voted for in the convention or Primaries of the party.\n\nPlaintiffs applied for an order of injunction restraining APC and INEC either by themselves or agents from preventing, hindering or stopping them from attending, participating in party congress, convention or primaries for the purpose of voting or being voted for as candidates in the forthcoming elections and in any congress, convention or primaries.\n\nIn their 26-paragraph affidavit in support of the suit, the 1st plaintiff, Sodique Abubakar claimed to be a political appointee and currently serving as Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Republic of Chad.\n\nAlso, the 2nd plaintiff, Sodique Lawal Abubakar, claimed to be a Special Assistant in the Federal Capital Territory Administration FCTA while the 3rd defendant, Bindir Umar Buba asserted to be National Coordinator, Social Investment Program in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nThey averred that they have obtained expression of interest forms to contest in the primaries of the APC for nomination as candidates in the coming election.\n\nThe plaintiffs further hinted that pursuant to signing of the Electoral Act into law, there had been threats that political appointees would be disqualified from contesting primaries of APC because of section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe affidavit deposed to by one Oluwafemi Abimbola, a legal practitioner on behalf of the plaintiffs, averred that sections 65, 66, 107, 131, 137,177 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution covered qualification requirements of aspirants to political posts in Nigeria.\n\nThey claimed that Article 2 of APC Constitution affirmed supremacy of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution, but the same party breached the section with its directive of May 7th that all political appointees must resign 30 days before its primary election.\n\nPlaintiffs stated that section 84 (11) and (12) were at the moment standing on their way to achieve their political ambitions and that unless, the APC and INEC were restrained, they would be prevented from participating in the primary for nomination as candidates.\n\nAs at the time of this report, no date has yet been fixed for hearing of the suit.\n\nBuhari orders Emefiele, other appointees to go\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has directed Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele and other top government officials seeking elective offices to resign.\n\nBuhari\u2019s directive was conveyed in a memo Wednesday by Secretary to Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha.\n\nThe memo followed the Federal Executive Council meeting on the same day, where the president instructed officials, including ministers, contesting in the forthcoming elections to step down before May 16.\n\nThe SGF\u2019s letter was addressed to ministers, heads of agencies, parastatals and departments, with the CBN governor as 16th on the list.\n\n\u201cMr President has observed and noted the expression of interest and intention by some members of the Federal Executive Council, Heads of Extra-ministerial Departments, Agencies, Parastalals of Government, Ambassadors and other Political Office holders to contest the upcoming Presidential, Gubernatorial, National and State Assemblies\u2019 elections,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Mr. President has directed that the affected office holders aspiring to run for various offices in the 2023 General Elections, should tender their resignation on or before Monday, the 16 of May, 2022.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, this directive affects all Ministers, Heads and Members of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals of Government, Ambassadors as well as other political appointees who desire to contest for elective offices.\n\n\u201cFor smooth running of the machinery of government and our foreign Missions, affected Ministers are to hand over to Ministers of State where they exist or to the Permanent Secretary, where there is no Minister of State. Ambassadors shall hand over to these Deputy Heads of Mission or the most Senior Foreign Service Officer in fine with established practices.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Heads of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals are to hand over to the most senior Director/Officer as may be peculiar to the organization, in line with the service wide Circular No. SGF.50VS. H/C 2/268 of 4\u2033 December, 2017,\u201d the memo reads.\n\nI\u2019m catching my fun- CBN gov\n\nBut in the midst of the controversy around his presidential ambition, the CBN governor Thursday told Nigerians he was catching his fun.\n\nHe spoke to journalists Thursday after a closed door meeting with President Buhari.\n\nPressed to tell them what transpired at the meeting, Emefiele said he had no news for them now, but promised that there would be one soonest.\n\nWhen told the world was waiting to hear from him, he said: \u201cLet them have a heart attack. It\u2019s good to have a heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no news now, but there will be news,\u201d Emefiele further added.\n\nUpon further probe, the CBN boss reiterated: \u201cYou heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",
          "summary": "They also urged the court to void section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 which directs political appointees to resign 30 days before party primaries.\nThe suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/641/2022, was instituted on their behalf by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Adeniyi Akintola.\nThey sought order declaring as unconstitutional, illegal and unlawful the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees must resign from their positions before they can participate as voting delegates or be voted for in the convention or Primaries of the party.\nThey claimed that Article 2 of APC Constitution affirmed supremacy of Nigeria\u2019s Constitution, but the same party breached the section with its directive of May 7th that all political appointees must resign 30 days before its primary election.\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, this directive affects all Ministers, Heads and Members of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals of Government, Ambassadors as well as other political appointees who desire to contest for elective offices.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Thursday said its sensitive election materials remained safe, assuring the process of warehousing them in the apex bank won\u2019t be compromised.\n\nThe commission also allayed the fear that the ongoing strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) won\u2019t stop the involvement of individual university lecturers in the INEC-organised elections.\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu stated this during the 2nd quarterly consultative meeting with the media at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking against the backdrop of the presidential bid of CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele, the INEC boss assured Nigerians that the commission would not be caught off guard in doing the needful and ensuring the sensitive materials are not compromised.\n\nHe was responding to the question on whether Emefiele\u2019s entry into politics won\u2019t affect the credibility and integrity of the electoral process.\n\nThe CBN governor is seeking the nation\u2019s top seat on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform.\n\nBesides, he is currently asking court to compel both the INEC and the Attorney General of the Federation to allow him enforce his right to participate in the 2023 presidential election without resigning as CBN boss.\n\nINEC allays fear\n\nResponding to the fear raised in certain quarters, Yakubu said the commission had no reason to doubt the capacity of CBN. \u201cI do understand the context in which the question is asked. But you should also understand the context in which events are unfolding. As we speak, our director, litigation and prosecution is in court.\n\n\u201cThere is a case in court. We have been invited to state our own side of the story. We usually refrain from talking about such issues because this is essentially subjudice.\n\n\u201cBut we have already started talking about what alternatives are available to us in case we need to change the arrangement for the handling of sensitive materials. We have started thinking about it. We are aware of the situation. We will watch the situation. We still have nine months before the next general elections.\n\n\u201cThings may be addressed before then. I want to assure you that we will not jeopardise the conduct of the election by creating a misconception around the situation in the process.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the ongoing ASUU strike would not affect the role often played by the dons during election, the INEC boss said there\u2019s no correlation between the union and the university teachers\u2019 involvement in the election.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have never heard the lecturers saying they won\u2019t participate in the elections. As a union, ASUU has never been involved in elections. In 2018, I had a meeting with them at the University of Abuja during a similar strike, and they said as a union, they won\u2019t participate, but that the individual lecturers were free. They are my good friends.\n\n\u201cI have been in the university system. Since 2003, they have always been participating in the elections; I was a member of the presidential negotiation in 2009. In 2013, at the end of my tenure (at TETFund), the federal government invited me to persuade ASUU. Myself and my friend \u2013Dipo Fasina drafted the agreement.\u201d\n\nOn Ekiti, Osun polls\n\nThe commission chairman also said the body had finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti state governorship election, and promised to undertake a mock voter accreditation exercise in the state ahead of the main election on 18th June 2022.\n\nThis, according to INEC, would further ensure optimal performance of the BVAS on election day.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe lessons learnt from the most recent bye-elections have been taken into consideration as the commission is prepared for the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun state governorship elections.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti state Governorship election. To further ensure optimal performance of the BVAS on election day, the commission will undertake a mock voter accreditation exercise in Ekiti State ahead of the main election on 18th June 2022.\n\n\u201cWith regard to the Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections, the commission is processing applications by media organisations for accreditation. I wish to reassure you that all applications will be carefully considered and expeditiously treated.\n\n\u201cThe commission will also work with the security agencies to ensure the safety and security of journalists and their unimpeded access to all voting and collation locations during elections.\u201d\n\nYakubu also said part of the deliberations at the meeting would be \u201cmany progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation.\u201d\n\nHe specifically said \u201cone of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting.\u201d\n\nResponding, President Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Comrade Chris Isiguzo urged the INEC to remain firm and focused in the quest to give Nigerians credible elections.\n\nWhile appealing to INEC not to disappoint Nigerians in the delivery of credible elections, the NUJ president commended the members of the National Assembly for the successful amendment of the Electoral Act, adding that \u201cthe document would turn our electoral process into one of the best in the world.\u201d\n\nHe also corrected a media report which quoted the Directorate of State Department (DSS) as saying there would be no 2023 elections given the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nComrade Isiguzo, who said he was present at the venue, noted that the report was false, urging journalists as partners in the democratic process to refrain from reporting fake news.\n\nThe NUJ leader urged the media to report events, especially political activities, responsibly and support INEC at all times in the pursuit of its functions to deliver on credible elections.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that with the establishment of world class healthcare facilities in Nigeria, the country was set to become a destination for medical tourism, in addition to reversing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nMohammed who spoke after a media tour of Duchess International Hospital in Lagos, said the world class healthcare facilities springing up in Nigeria will also curb medical tourism abroad, conserve foreign reserves and create jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here at the Duchess International Hospital. During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",
