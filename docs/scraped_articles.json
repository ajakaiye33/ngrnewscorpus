I have been vaccinated and I will be back with my card tomorrow,\u201d one of the workers told The PUNCH.\n\nWhen asked about how the government would be able to sustain this move, Haruna stated, \u201cWhat is important is that where there is a will, there is a way. Governor Godwin Obaseki had demonstrated that the state wants to save lives by dishing out this directive.\n\n\u201cWe expect little hitches at the take-off but there will be an improvement as we move on. I am also sure that the people will also want to see if the government is serious about the directive. And with what we had said today, we are demonstrating that the government is ready to save lives in the state.\n\n\u201cI am sure that those who did not come with their vaccination cards today and were sent back home to bring them will not do a similar mistake tomorrow. It is clear that many of the workers have taken the vaccine but they are yet to get used to the practice of going about with their cards.\n\nWith the media giving what we are doing here the necessary publicity, people will know the need to comply with the directive.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022PDP: Buhari and APC selling Nigeria, urges NASS probe\n\nChuks Okocha and Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has formally sent a letter to the Senate seeking its consideration and approval of $4.179 billion ($4.054 billion and $125 million) as well as \u00a3710 million external loans to fund projects captured under the 2018-2021 borrowing plan.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday vehemently rejected the move by the president, alleging that the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) was on a mission to mortgage the country.\n\nThe loan requests were the second time in 2021, that President Buhari would be asking the upper legislative chamber for approval of external loan to fund critical projects in the country.\n\nLast May, the President sought the approval of the Senate to borrow $6.1 billion from the international capital market which the Red Chamber graciously approved shortly before going on a two-month long annual vacation in July, 2021.\n\nThe latest letter of request dated August 24, 2021 by President Buhari was read at yesterday plenary by President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan.\n\nThe President in the letter explained that the projects listed in the 2018-2021 Federal Government Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chatered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of $4,054,476,863.00; \u20ac710,000,000.00 and Grant Component of $125,000,000.00.\n\nHe explained that the amount would be used to fund federal and state projects cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVID-19 Response efforts.\n\nAccording to the president, the projects which are spread across the six geo-political zones of the country would bring about employment generation and poverty reduction, as well as protection of the most vulnerable and very poor segments of the Nigerian society.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cI write in respect of the above subject and to submit the attached addendum to the proposed 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan for the consideration and concurrent approval of the Senate for same to become effective.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President may wish to recall that I earlier transmitted a request on the proposed 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan for the concurrent approval of the Senate in May, 2021.\n\n\u201cHowever, in view of other emerging needs and to ensure that all critical projects approved by FEC as at June 2021 are incorporated, I hereby forward and addendum to the proposed Borrowing Plan.\n\n\u201cThe projects listed in the addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency (AFD), China-Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE) in the total sum of $4,054,476,863.00; \u20ac710,000,000.00 and Grant Component of $125,000,000.00.\u201d\n\nThe president added: \u201cThe Senate is kindly invited to note that the projects and programmes in the Borrowing Plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations and the contribution they would make to the socio-economic development of the country including employment generation and poverty reduction as well as protection of the most vulnerable and very poor segments of the Nigerian society.\n\n\u201cThe Senate may also wish to note that all the listed projects in the addendum form part of the 2018-2021 External Borrowing Plan and cover both the federal and states government projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVID-19 response efforts.\n\n\u201cA summary of some key projects in each of the six geo-political zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\n\u201cGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed Borrowing Plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the Senate for projects listed in the addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Plan to enable the projects become effective.\u201d\n\nBuhari, APC Selling Nigeria, PDP Cries Out\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has the planned borrowing would further mortgage the nation.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, lamented that with the endless borrowing by president Buhari and the APC, Nigerians might eventually not have a nation and a patrimony they would be able to freely call their own.\n\nThe PDP further stated that with the N33.107 trillion debt already accumulated by President Buhari and the APC, \u201cwith nothing to show but decayed infrastructure and a depressed economy, with the additional borrowing proposed by Buhari for the 2022 budget and now a fresh N2.66 trillion external loan, the APC would be hanging over N40 trillion debt on the nation, with no clear-cut repayment plan.\u201d\n\nMore alarming, the PDP stated were the debts, \u201cthe APC is hanging on Nigerians are for nebulous projects whose scopes, utilities, locations and contractors are largely vague; a development that validates apprehensions of a huge swindle on our nation at the expense of innocent Nigerians, including generation yet unborn.\u201d\n\nThe party added: \u201cOur party holds it as an act of wickedness that individuals who know that they will be leaving office in less than two years will be accumulating debts instead of seeking ways to reduce the liability they have brought upon our nation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthe APC knows it will not be around after May 29, 2023. That is why it is pushing our nation into deeper economic quagmire with foreign loans, which are largely diverted to personal pockets of their corrupt leaders.\n\n\u201cGiven their incompetence, corruption and manifest nonchalant attitude to the plights of Nigerians, the APC and its administration have not shown any commitment towards wealth creation as expected of any responsible government.\u201d\n\nRather, the party said the APC had resorted to reckless borrowing, \u201cpillaging of the national vault and suppression of our productive sectors; a development that have crippled our Gross Domestic Produce (GDP) to the extent that our naira, which the PDP handed over to the APC at N167 to a dollar, has now collapsed to a dismal and all-time low of N557 to a dollar under the APC.\u201d\n\nThe PDP called on the National Assembly to save the nation by rising above partisan sentiments, \u201cto reject this latest request by President Buhari for a fresh foreign loan.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also urged the National Assembly to immediately commence an open investigative hearing on all the loans collected by President Buhari especially with allegations that such loans were being diverted to the personal pockets of APC leaders, the cabal in the Presidency as well as APC government functionaries and their cronies.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Rivers State government on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court of Nigeria to quash the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, which ordered parties to maintain Status Quo in a suit seeking to determine, who has the right to collect Value Added Tax (VAT) in Rivers State.\n\nJustice Stephen Pam of a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had in a judgment delivered on August 9, held that the Rivers State government and not the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), had the right to collect VAT and Personal Income Tax in the state.\n\nJustice Pam, in the judgment subsequently restrained the Attorney General of the Federation and FIRS (1st and 2nd defendants) from collecting VAT in Rivers and directed the Rivers State government to take charge of the duty.\n\nHowever, the appellate court in a ruling last Friday, ordered all parties that have submitted themselves before the court to maintain status quo ante bellum pending the hearing of an application seeking to stay the judgment of Justice Pam, which restrained FIRS from collecting VAT in Rivers State.\n\nFIRS had approached the appellate to set aside the judgment of the trial court, pending the hearing of the main suit. The appellant applied for an order for stay of the Federal High Court Judgment and another order of interlocutory injunction restraining Rivers from collecting VAT in the state.\n\nIn a short ruling, a three member panel of Justices of the appellate court presided by Justice Haruna Tsammani, ordered parties to maintain status quo ante bellum and not to give effect to the judgment of Justice Pam.\n\nThe order was to enable the court hear Lagos State joinder application before taking the motion for stay and interlocutory injunction.\n\nBut displeased with the decision, Rivers, on Tuesday approached the Supreme Court to set aside the ruling of the appellate court on grounds that the lower court erred in ordering status after it earlier held that the application for joinder by Lagos State must be heard first before the motion for stay and interlocutory injunction by the FIRS.\n\nThe appellant maintained that the appellate court lacks the powers to set aside its own judgment, which held that the Lagos application for joinder must be taken before any other application.\n\nThey further argued that ordering status quo ante bellum amounts to granting the reliefs being sought by the FIRS, when the main application has not been heard and determined.\n\nAmong the reliefs being sought was an order dismissing the oral application for interim injunction and another order excusing the panel, which granted the status quo from further hearing of the appeal.\n\nShortly after the court held that it would give priority to the Lagos motion and adjourned for its hearing, counsel to the FIRS, Mr Mahmud Magaji, SAN, made an oral application for interim injunction so as to preserve the res (revenue collection \u2013 the main issue).\n\nAlthough this position was opposed by counsel to Rivers and Lagos States, who were yet to be joined as a party, the three member panel however in a unanimous decision, held that the parties must maintain status quo.\n\nIn the appeal filed by its lawyer, Mr Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, the Rivers State government argued that the appellate court erred in law, when it ordered maintenance of status quo on a case that was not perishable or has any evidence of being damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe appellant further argued that the appellate court erred in law when it went outside the reliefs sought by the respondent in its motion on notice filed August 27.\n\nThey further maintained that the court was wrong in ordering status quo ante bellum after the Rivers State House of Assembly had passed its VAT law, which was assented to by the governor, Nyesom Wike, on August 19.\n\nThey, therefore, want the court to set aside the ruling of the Justice Tsammani-led panel against the judgment of Justice Pam for being a nullity.\n\nThe appellate court had held that the right of Lagos State would be affected adversely if not heard since the appellant had already made allegations against it.\n\nWhile adjourning to September 16 for the hearing of the joinder application by Lagos AG, Justice Tsammani, held that since the application for stay and interlocutory injunction could not be heard, it was only proper to preserve the \u2018res\u2019.\n\nInvoking the powers of the court in line with section 6 of the Constitution, to preserve the res from being dissipated, the court ordered that all those that have submitted themselves before the court should maintain status quo ante bellum.\n\nAccording to the ruling, all parties should refrain themselves from giving effect to the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt delivered on August 9, which restrained the FIRS from collecting VAT in Rivers State.\n\nHe subsequently adjourned to Thursday, September 16 for the hearing of the application for joinder by the Lagos AG.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The recent drive by the Nigerian government to make COVID-19 vaccination compulsory for civil servants has been attributed to the lacklustre performance of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency in the handling of the vaccination exercise across the country.\n\nSources in the agency told SaharaReporters that its Executive Director, Dr Faisal Shuaib, politicised the whole exercise at the detriment of getting Nigerians vaccinated.\n\nThey alleged Shuaib had not shown enough commitment to getting Nigerians vaccinated but was \u201cinterested in how he could make a kill from the COVID-19 vaccination programme.\u201d\n\n\"It has been frustrating that the executive director has elected to play with the lives of Nigerians in such a brazen manner. The general public might not know that the figures bandied in the public domain are far from what is on the ground in reality. He went to the length in ensuring that individuals and groups with the required competence to ensure the validity of the vaccines and its deployment are sidelined and replaced with his cronies,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nAnother source alleged that the agency\u2019s Executive Director saw the vaccination programme as an avenue to enrich his pocket.\n\n\u201cThe executive director has constantly diverted funds meant for logistics to his cronies under different nomenclatures, and in most instances leaving vaccinators stranded, thereby altering the distribution chain and in most times before the vaccines reach their intended locations, there is a possibility that its potency might have been greatly reduced as a result of improper storage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the government does not take urgent and proactive steps, it might just be that what is being administered to Nigerians might be ineffective vaccines and its consequent implication because, with the present realities on the ground in the agency with regards the administration, it is a doomed exercise.\n\n\"In our agency, everything is overinflated, and no one dares to question the executive director. The procurement and audit departments have been compromised by the executive who has ensured that his cronies are in strategic places to ensure that his biddings are carried out without any resistance.\"\n\n\u201cIf the government is serious in its fight against corruption, it should turn the light on the NPHCDA, and the revelations that would come out would be mind-boggling. What is happening in the agency is nothing but a shame.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a public health expert decried the low vaccination exercise due to the ineptitude of the NPHCDA.\n\nHe stated that with how the agency is undertaking the vaccination exercise, Nigeria might never attain effective vaccination of Nigerians against COVID-19.\n\nHe added that the government erred fundamentally by domiciling the COVID 19 vaccination with the NPHCDA, forgetting to realise that this is a peculiar exercise and one not to be subjected to the routine bureaucracy in most government agencies.",

          "title": "How BFree is improving trust in the lending space",
          "text": "A few months ago, Udoma Nseobong took a \u20a630,000 ($60) loan from CashLion Credit. He repaid the weekly interest consistently for six weeks until his final payment.\n\nUnfortunately, he defaulted on his final payment by a day due to unforeseen circumstances. This short period was enough time for Nseobong to be declared by CashLion credit as a fraudster on the run with his entire family to his contacts (OP: ICIR Nigeria).\n\nThis incident is one out of many which indicate that digital lenders will go the extra mile, sometimes using unethical methods, to get their loans back.\n\nNotably, despite the criticism against unethical practices by lenders, some still justify this method of debt collection.\n\n\u201cThere is no defamation of character involved when we trust people we\u2019ve never seen by giving them money and when it\u2019s time to pay they don\u2019t pay,\u201d Titilayo Adetonya, a customer representative for digital lender CashLion told The ICIR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lawful to send those messages to their contacts because we warn them before we send those messages to their contacts and that\u2019s how we get our money,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter many years of unending complaints, on August 17, the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), slammed Soko Loan Company Limited, a Nigerian digital lending platform, with a fine of \u20a610 million for privacy invasion. Soko Loan was found guilty of unilaterally sending privacy-invading messages to the loan defaulters\u2019 contacts.\n\nThis sanction, although a mere warning shot, is the first public attempt by NITDA to address this prevalent issue. The sanction served as a clarion call for digital lenders to use ethical alternative methods to collect loans.\n\nBut what does an ethical alternative look like and how effective is it?\n\nAn alternative approach\n\nJulian Flosbach knows what it\u2019s like to look for better alternatives, as he experienced it first hand when he was the general manager at FairMoney, a Nigeria-based digital lender turned digital bank. He helped grow the company from 8 employees to over 120 employees; and in that same period, Julian also supervised doling out loans to over a million customers.\n\n\u201cIn the early days when giving out a few loans, it\u2019s easy to have a team of five in charge of collections but as things scale up and you have to manage over one million borrowers you start reconsidering a few things,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWhen you have 100,000 defaulters [10% default rate], you have to ask yourself, \u2018Do I want to be a fintech lender or do I want to be a collection company?\u2019\n\nAt one point, FairMoney had as many as 80 employees managing collections in-house; but it quickly became clear that running in-house collections moved the company\u2019s focus away from its business model: giving out loans.\n\nSo the company decided to search for an external solution, and found themselves with the best available option at that time: business process outsourcing (BPO) firms who do customer service for big banks and telcos. But it didn\u2019t take long to see that there were some cracks in the collection process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do collections with operational excellence then just calling customers actually doesn\u2019t always work. These BPOs don\u2019t have customised computer systems for collections, rather they have generic customer relationship management tools (CRMs) or predictive dialers. So for instance they call customers once a week, instead of when the customer actually should or wants to be called. It\u2019s not very efficient.\u201d\n\nThis harrowing experience led him to team up with Moses Nmor (Chief Product Officer), and Chukwudi Enyi (Chief Operations Officer) to start BFree, Africa\u2019s first digital credit collection company. All three co-founders worked together at FairMoney.\n\nThe company saw an opportunity to be one of the less than ten digital credit collection companies grappling for a slice of a $14.4b credit collection market in emerging markets. In emerging markets, BFree\u2019s competitors are India\u2019s Credgenics (recently raised $25m Series A) and CreditMate (backed by Paytm), FLOW in Singapore and Blu365 in Brazil.\n\nIn the space of over a year since it launched, BFree has grown to nearly 460,000 active customers from over 20 lenders in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nWhat does Ethical credit management look like?\n\nLooking away from the approach of other debt collection solutions, most of which thrive on humiliating customers, BFree focuses on ethics and technology in debt recovery.\n\nBFree helps lenders collect loans from their borrowers for a fee. The company charges a commission on the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size and quality amongst other factors.\n\nBFree\u2019s ethical approach to loan recovery is guided by a data-backed belief that the majority of customers take a loan with the intention to repay. Of course, with the exception of isolated cases of fraudsters and fraud victims.\n\nThis approach is validated by the fact that the average 90 days default rate of Nigeria\u2019s top digital lending companies is 10% \u2014 FairMoney (10%), Carbon (11%), Branch (<10%). This means that only about 10% of Nigerians (there\u2019s no central register, but Flosbach estimates about 10-15 million people) default on loans.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the customers (70-75%) fall into the category of folks that want to pay but cannot repay. This is usually due to loss of income \u2014 loss of job or the business went bad or there was an emergency that took away the money.\u201d\n\nThis is a common case in a country like Nigeria where people live from hand to mouth. Without insurance, anything can topple their sustainability.\n\nAt BFree customers are appraised based on two factors: willingness and capability to pay.\n\n\u201cWhen a lender like Branch or FairMoney gives us a portfolio, we assess and underwrite the loan. We take their behavioural data and build two things: collectability score and use case. Then we move these into a collection funnel.\u201d\n\nThis debt collection process basically starts as a self-service platform where customers can log in and see their own repayment plans. At this phase, customers get SMS messages and perform loan repayment activities themselves. This way BFree reduces the number of man-hours spent on making calls and customers aren\u2019t forced to deal with unexpected phone calls during working hours.\n\nIn the case where a customer defaults, BFree reaches out to the borrower to find out why and to also get a promised date of payment (verbal agreement). This simply involves reaching out and asking them for when they\u2019ll be able to make a payment. Based on the agreed dates, automated reminders are put in place.\n\nBFree operates call centres with about 200 agents who are responsible for reaching out to customers. BFree\u2019s goal is to make the process of debt recovery 95% automated in the next few years.\n\n\u201cThe story of collections has gotten bad press with BPOs taking data and threatening customers. Automating this process helps remove the risk of this happening because a bot will never threaten a customer.\u201c\n\nWhat happens when customers default\n\nFlosbach acknowledges that one of the inherent risks of lending is that you have to accept that there\u2019s always going to be default. He believes that the way out here is to accept that some customers won\u2019t repay, and assist customers that will repay as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no portfolio in the world that doesn\u2019t have default. In this case, you have to assess whether it\u2019s a natural default or an operational default.\u201d\n\nIn a natural default, the customers don\u2019t repay because of an unexpected occurrence like a health emergency. When this happens the best case is to re-assess the customer status and agree on a different repayment plan.\n\n\u201cWe should normalize the fact that customers have financial emergencies, the same way nobody blames people for going to the doctor when they fall unexpectedly sick.\u201c\n\nIn an operational default customers don\u2019t repay because of a flaw in the loan collection process. For example, customers don\u2019t get the right repayment plan or they\u2019re not aware of how to make the repayment i.e they don\u2019t know which bank account to pay to.\n\nBFree\u2019s process helps to ensure that operational default decreases as much as possible. So far 95% of customers have rated their experience with BFree as good or satisfactory, a hint that the company\u2019s approach is effective.\n\nAs lending expands beyond an activity being performed by only traditional banks and digital lenders to one that almost every company can, BFree\u2019s value proposition remains relevant.\n\nFlosbach believes that BFree\u2019s ultimate goal is to increase trust in the African lending space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing trust in the financial retail market by decreasing risk and giving businesses a better margin.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

The result is that access to the internet has become ubiquitous in many of the densely populated areas across the enormous country.\n\nCitizens in Sudan \u201crely heavily on mobile data as the primary means to keep its populace connected to the rest of the world,\u201d says the report.\n\nAlgeria is second-cheapest at $0.51, while Somalia takes the third-cheapest slot on the continent, at $0.60 per 1GB of mobile data.\n\nConsumer telecoms analyst at Cable, Dan Howdle, said countries with the cheapest rates of mobile data have excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure, making it easier for service providers in those markets to be able to offer large amounts of data, which brings down the price per gigabyte.\n\n\u201cOthers with less advanced broadband networks are heavily reliant on mobile data and the economy dictates that prices must be low, as that\u2019s what people can afford,\u201d said Howdle in the report.\n\nSudan, with a population of more than 45 million and at least 13 million internet subscribers is at par with Italy ($0.27), but trails Israel ($0.05), Kyrgyzstan ($0.15) and Fiji ($0.19), in the global ranking.\n\nPhoto by Kojo Kwarteng on Unsplash\n\nInternet data costs per region in Africa\n\nOther African countries that charge mobile internet subscribers less than $1 to browse the web and run mobile apps are Ghana ($0.66), Libya ($0.74), Tanzania ($0.75), Mauritius ($0.75), Nigeria ($0.88), Cameroon ($0.90) and Senegal ($0.94).\n\nThe report, which featured more than 230 countries across 12 regions and compared the cost of 1GB from over 6,000 mobile data plans, also pointed out that North Africa (at an average of $1.53) has the cheapest data plans in the world.\n\nAlgeria (16), Libya (30) and Morocco (45) are in the World\u2019s top 50 while Egypt (55) Tunisia (59) and Mauritania feature in the top 100 global list.\n\nHowever, Egypt ($1.04), Tunisia ($1.09) and Mauritania ($5.56) charge more than $1 for 1GB of data.\n\nKenya and South Africa, with advanced mobile infrastructure and high internet traffic, fall far behind the top 100 list, with charges of $2.25 and $2.67 per gigabyte of data respectively\n\nThe cost of data in these two countries, however, is cheaper than the global average of $4.07. According to the report, South Africa and Kenya are considered competitive mobile markets with the prices of these \u2018wealthy nations\u2019 not necessarily considered expensive by customers.\n\n\u201cMany countries in the middle of the list have good infrastructure and competitive mobile markets, and while their prices aren\u2019t among the cheapest in the world they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be considered expensive by its consumers,\u201d says the report.\n\nSouth Africa and Kenya have rolled out commercial 5G networks in their markets.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s neglected fishing industry, and the men feeding millions with crude tools",
          "text": "When Inibe Alupe graduated from Niger Delta University in 2008, he looked forward to a job in an office after undergoing the one-year compulsory national youth service.\n\nOver 12 years after, Mr Alupe still has no white-collar job. He has since returned to his native Ogbia in Bayelsa State, a riverine community, to do what knew how to do while growing up: fishing.\n\n\u201cI left school in 2008 and served Nigeria, but since then I have no reasonable source of income,\u201d he told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nAn increasing number of young educated Nigerians are taking up fish farming, mainly as a result of lack of white or blue-collar jobs, and their presence is an indicator of the sector\u2019s potential to attract skilled manpower capable of driving growth in the industry.\n\nSo far, that is where the good news ends. For a country with vast inland water bodies and coastline measuring over 800 km, Nigeria\u2019s fishing industry is significantly underperforming.\n\nNigeria\u2019s household fish consumption stood at 13.3 kg/capita/year, significantly lower than the world\u2019s average of 20.3 kg/capita/year, according to the United Nation\u2019s food agency, FAO.\n\nBeyond the problem of poverty that stops many from affording needed sea food, the country suffers a major fish supply-demand gap problem.\n\nA 2016 National Bureau of Statistics report estimated Nigeria\u2019s annual fish demand at 3.32 million metric tonnes, with local production at 1.12 million metric tonnes. That year, Nigeria spent N125 billion (US$625 million) on fish imports.\n\nWhy sector underperforms\n\nA key reason for Nigeria\u2019s inability to turn around the fishing industry is that the sector has been neglected by the government for decades, leaving the sector and its operators without necessary policies, tools, credit and skills.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of locally produced fish come from small-scale operations, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO.\n\nThere are other factors like environmental pollution that destroys fish stocks and reduces the catch, and theft by foreign fishing syndicates.\n\n\u201cIn this part of the country, there is a disconnect between the government and the governed,\u201d said Nalaguo Alagoa, a former lecturer in the Department of Fisheries Science and Allied Aquacultures at the Rivers State University of Science and Technology.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to mention countries but there are a lot of what appear to be Japanese and Chinese vessels that come to fish in our waters. There are others too who fish in our waters, because the vessels don\u2019t fly the Nigerian flag. They catch a lot of fish which they take to Lagos to be delivered as imported. We take them over as imports so we do not always import fish from outside most of the time, we are \u2018importing\u2019 our own fish from within our territory!\u201d he said.\n\nOld-fashioned, ineffective\n\nMost of Nigeria\u2019s fish production occurs in the coastal states in the south where people fish from natural water bodies \u2014 creeks, mangroves, lakes, ponds, rivers, and rivulets.\n\nBut the obsolete methods of these workers show the limitations that have affected growth in the sector.\n\nIn Bayelsa and Rivers State, for instance, most farmers still use nets, hooks and hand-powered canoes, and other tools considered outdated and ineffective. This leaves them struggling to increase the catch.\n\nFarmers who spoke to PREMIUM TIMES said they struggled to buy big fishing nets that cost between as low as N30,000 and as high as N200,000, needed to increase the catch.\n\nTo catch a fish worth N6,000, a fisherman using a net has to spend a night on the water, they said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur nets are not strong enough to catch big fishes. When fishing, we go in pairs because we need one person to paddle the canoe and the other person to throw the net,\u201d said Mr Alupe.\n\nSinebe Ogbara, another fisherman in Famgbe in Yenagoa LGA of Bayelsa State, said since members of their local fishermen association cannot afford modern fishing equipment, they go fishing in turns to allow each member a fair catch.\n\nAnother fisherman, Station Winfred, said most fishermen lack modern fishing skills and credit support, hence their operations are at the subsistence level.\n\nSome operators manage to raise their operations through personal efforts, but still don\u2019t receive government support.\n\nEmmanuel Akarasei, 71, belongs to God\u2019s Time Fish Farmers Cooperatives but said he has not benefited from the Bayelsa State Government support programmes even though the group is officially registered.\n\nHe bought his own speed boat engine in October 2020 when he could no longer cope with the stress of paddling a canoe. The engine cost N120, 000 and it took Mr Emmanuel two years to save up the money.\n\nAkro Iniessien has been fishing for 69 years in Oloibiri, the oil-rich community where oil prospecting began in Nigeria. She single-handedly built her fishing business. She said she has never benefited from the Third National Fadama Development Project or the Bayelsa State Agricultural Development Programme.\n\nThese two schemes are funded by the Bayelsa State Government and Federal Government in collaboration with the World Bank.\n\n\u201cThey came here, they made inquiries and made promises to us but nothing happened,\u201d she said. The great-grandmother started fishing at the age of six in Oloibiri with her mother.\n\nEmma Atamuno, a native of Rivers State, said members of the group of fishermen he belongs to aspire to practice industrial fishing but are constrained by the use of canoes and hooks.\n\nAccording to him, the association of about 50 fishermen employs young men from the community and neighbouring areas. The younger members practise while the older ones supervise and provide technical support and advice.\n\nThe group is yet to get any meaningful support from the Rivers State Government, he said.\n\nAsked if he pays taxes, he said no. \u201cThey have failed. They have a conscience so they cannot come here and demand tax, they are not justified.\n\n\u201cSee that building there (pointing in the direction of a faraway building), that is where the ADP people stay. We no dey see them sef, we no fit carry our problems to go there. Maybe na like once in a year dem dey come,\u201d he said in Pidgin English.\n\nAgbere is a community in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. On arrival at the waterfront, our reporter met Jonathan Hamo, a fisherman for many years. Mr Hamo told PREMIUM TIMES that he only received support from the government once in 2006.\n\nThe support came in the form of a fibre canoe, a speed boat, and assorted fishing nets from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Fifteen years later, the fibre boat is grounded but the speed boat is still functioning. Mr Hamo said no government official had inspected any of the fishing tools for over 14 years now.\n\nAside from the NDDC, Mr Hamo is a beneficiary of the Fadama 3 Project and said he has attended many training programmes on fish production and the value chain.\n\n\u201cI benefited from the Fadama 3 Project, and the NDDC Programme. The NDDC gave me these items some 15 years ago, but they only came for inspection twice and that was all. I have not seen them since that administration left,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen officials of the Fadama 3 Project visited Agbere and other communities in Sagbama LGA for a training exercise, they shared N1,000 as stipend to farmers who attended. Farmers like Mr Akarasei got no further incentives after the training.\n\nBefore the training, each of them had paid N3,000 in the expectation of receiving materials that would aid their fishing activities. But they all left disappointed.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nIn Rivers State, the Vice Chairman of Fishermen Association in Idanga-ama, Emma Atamuno, said the group wrote letters to the state government and River Basin Development Authority for support. The State Ministry of Agriculture later sent them forms to fill in 2019 but nothing came from it.\n\nThe head office of NDDC is in Idanga-ama but that has not made its officials notice the fish farmers, Mr Atanumo said.\n\nOil spillage and illegal\n\nOil pollution has also affected fishing in the Niger Delta. Besides destroying aquatic lives, oil pollution also makes fishing boats and nets to age faster, locals said.\n\nInnocent Birah, a fisherman in Rivers State, was making a new net when PREMIUM TIMES arrived at his home in Port Harcourt. Mr Birah has been a fisherman for 24 years but has been struggling with water pollution. His fishing nets usually lasted for four years but oil in the water now damages the nets within a few months, he said.\n\nMr Birah, like others, said he was tired of unfulfilled promises from the government on the issue of pollution or providing an alternative for the fishermen.\n\n\u201cThe oil in water is a major problem. The water makes the fishes run, even the ones we catch are almost losing their taste. The oil changes the colour of the nets from white to black and reduces the lifespan of the net,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe spokesperson for the FADAMA project in Rivers State, Friday Obiarije, explained why its programme does not support artisanal fishermen. He said the reason is to discourage the traditional farming system.\n\nMr Obiarije said the project encourages fish farmers to form associations to benefit from its programmes, under which fish farming tools were distributed to farmers in Rivers State. The programme wants farmers to quit artisanal fishing and begin fish farming, he stressed.\n\n\u201cIf they leave the waters, they can start fish ponds, and even grow what we need. What we are doing is to take their attention from that system of fishing which is not profitable,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC, yesterday, invited the Director-General of Budget Office, Mr Ben Akabueze, in its ongoing investigation into alleged procurement of substandard equipment for the Police.\n\nVanguard had reported two weeks ago that some of the procured equipment by the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, NPTF, for the Police, including bullet proof vests and helmets, were below standard, as the bullet proof vests were discovered to have protective shield in front only, while the helmets were too small.\n\nConsequently, the office where the equipment were stored was sealed, pending the outcome of ICPC\u2019s investigation.\n\nHowever, more findings have revealed that some of the vehicles purchased with the N11 billion intervention fund for the police were refurbished and not new ones as expected.\n\nThey were suspected to be used vehicles from war torn regions like Sudan and Libya.\n\nOrdinarily, newly acquired Buffalo vans for security agencies come in green camouflage colour before they are painted to suit the colour of the designated security agency.\n\nBut in the case of those procured by the NPTF, some of the vehicles allegedly arrived in other country\u2019s colours before being repainted.\n\nVanguard reliably gathered that one of the vans blew up, while on motion to venue of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s son\u2019s recent wedding in Kano State.\n\nSources further revealed that some medical equipment bought for the Police medical arm were allegedly substandard.\n\nOne of the items said to be the IV fluids, otherwise known as infusion drips, a sterile solution made of sodium chloride and water, came in sachets instead of plastic tubes.\n\nSources at NPTF explained that drips come in different concentrations either in bottles or sachets.\n\nIn the ongoing investigation, members of the NPTF Board and some directors are expected to appear before the ICPC at designated dates.\n\nQuestioning of top officials began on Monday, September 13,2021, with the Directors of Legal Services and Planning, Research and Statistics: Mrs Victoria Ojogbane and Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed , respectively.\n\nTheir invitation and time schedule as indicated in a letter signed by the Commission\u2019s Director of Operations, Akeem Lawal, slated Tuesday, September 14, 2021 for the Director, Finance and Account ,Mr Lawal Gunjunju and the Special Assistant Technical, by 10 am and 1 pm respectively.\n\nFor today, Mr Ben Akabueze , a Board member, is expected to appear before the commission by 1pm, while Engr. Mansur Hammed, also a board member and IGP Suleiman Abba, retd, the Board chairman, are expected to appear before the commission tomorrow, by 10 am and 1 pm respectively.\n\nThe invitees, according to the letter of invitation, are to face the commission with copies of all payment vouchers for over head, recurrent and capital for year 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe letter read: \u201c The invited staff are to come with the following documents as applicable to their office and schedule as well as original copies for sighting: two copies of all contract agreement for contract awarded from the take off grant and capital; copies of staff nominal role; comprehensive list of staff on transfer , posting and secondment ; vote for take-off grant; breakdown of all spending and approvals; print out of ledger vote and spending, all no objection certificates from Bureau of Public procurement, BPP, and evidence of BPP clarification on contract award, financial limits and thresholds, procurement methods and thresholds of application and expenditure as related to NPTF\u201d\u2026\n\nNPTF rejects President Buhari\u2019s office accommodation offer\n\nMeanwhile, Vanguard gathered that the NPTF may have rejected an offer of a befitting office at Area 11, Garki, Abuja, by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe President was said to have given approval for the use of two floors in the newly commissioned Pensions building to the NPTF.\n\nThe approved office is said to be well furnished with chairs and tables , central air conditioners and an elevator .\n\nBut the NPTF is yet to move into the building, as it currently shares an office with the Police budget office, a situation that leaves most of its staff roaming about , without a place to comfortably do their jobs.\n\nInformation at Vanguard\u2019s disposal revealed that some senior officials of the NPTF are insisting on renting an office that will be exclusive to them.\n\nAn office space reportedly sourced for that purpose is said to be N600 million per annum.\n\nVanguard learned that there is an ongoing cold war among some Board members as a result of this development.

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC, yesterday, invited the Director-General of Budget Office, Mr Ben Akabueze, in its ongoing investigation into alleged procurement of substandard equipment for the Police.\n\nVanguard had reported two weeks ago that some of the procured equipment by the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, NPTF, for the Police, including bullet proof vests and helmets, were below standard, as the bullet proof vests were discovered to have protective shield in front only, while the helmets were too small.\n\nConsequently, the office where the equipment were stored was sealed, pending the outcome of ICPC\u2019s investigation.\n\nHowever, more findings have revealed that some of the vehicles purchased with the N11 billion intervention fund for the police were refurbished and not new ones as expected.\n\nThey were suspected to be used vehicles from war torn regions like Sudan and Libya.\n\nOrdinarily, newly acquired Buffalo vans for security agencies come in green camouflage colour before they are painted to suit the colour of the designated security agency.\n\nBut in the case of those procured by the NPTF, some of the vehicles allegedly arrived in other country\u2019s colours before being repainted.\n\nVanguard reliably gathered that one of the vans blew up, while on motion to venue of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s son\u2019s recent wedding in Kano State.\n\nSources further revealed that some medical equipment bought for the Police medical arm were allegedly substandard.\n\nOne of the items said to be the IV fluids, otherwise known as infusion drips, a sterile solution made of sodium chloride and water, came in sachets instead of plastic tubes.\n\nSources at NPTF explained that drips come in different concentrations either in bottles or sachets.\n\nIn the ongoing investigation, members of the NPTF Board and some directors are expected to appear before the ICPC at designated dates.\n\nQuestioning of top officials began on Monday, September 13,2021, with the Directors of Legal Services and Planning, Research and Statistics: Mrs Victoria Ojogbane and Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed , respectively.\n\nTheir invitation and time schedule as indicated in a letter signed by the Commission\u2019s Director of Operations, Akeem Lawal, slated Tuesday, September 14, 2021 for the Director, Finance and Account ,Mr Lawal Gunjunju and the Special Assistant Technical, by 10 am and 1 pm respectively.\n\nFor today, Mr Ben Akabueze , a Board member, is expected to appear before the commission by 1pm, while Engr. Mansur Hammed, also a board member and IGP Suleiman Abba, retd, the Board chairman, are expected to appear before the commission tomorrow, by 10 am and 1 pm respectively.\n\nThe invitees, according to the letter of invitation, are to face the commission with copies of all payment vouchers for over head, recurrent and capital for year 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe letter read: \u201c The invited staff are to come with the following documents as applicable to their office and schedule as well as original copies for sighting: two copies of all contract agreement for contract awarded from the take off grant and capital; copies of staff nominal role; comprehensive list of staff on transfer , posting and secondment ; vote for take-off grant; breakdown of all spending and approvals; print out of ledger vote and spending, all no objection certificates from Bureau of Public procurement, BPP, and evidence of BPP clarification on contract award, financial limits and thresholds, procurement methods and thresholds of application and expenditure as related to NPTF\u201d\u2026\n\nNPTF rejects President Buhari\u2019s office accommodation offer\n\nMeanwhile, Vanguard gathered that the NPTF may have rejected an offer of a befitting office at Area 11, Garki, Abuja, by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe President was said to have given approval for the use of two floors in the newly commissioned Pensions building to the NPTF.\n\nThe approved office is said to be well furnished with chairs and tables , central air conditioners and an elevator .\n\nBut the NPTF is yet to move into the building, as it currently shares an office with the Police budget office, a situation that leaves most of its staff roaming about , without a place to comfortably do their jobs.\n\nInformation at Vanguard\u2019s disposal revealed that some senior officials of the NPTF are insisting on renting an office that will be exclusive to them.\n\nAn office space reportedly sourced for that purpose is said to be N600 million per annum.\n\nVanguard learned that there is an ongoing cold war among some Board members as a result of this development.

          "title": "$272m paid to Alison-Madueke: Glencore staff tells U.S. DOJ",
          "text": "Anthony Stimler, a former senior staff of Swiss oil trader, Glencore Plc has made startling confession to U.S. Department of Justice on Diezani Alison-Madueke and others bribed by the company. He reveals the $272 million of Nigeria\u2019s oil income diverted into Diezani\u2019s private account, the $500,000 bribe paid to her to lift oil cargoes, the $300,000 monthly levy on oil firms in the run-up to the 2015 election. Read on:\n\nWhen Anthony Stimler left Glencore Plc in August 2019, he had two big secrets: For a dozen years, he\u2019d paid millions in bribes to African officials and intermediaries. And he was now helping a U.S. Justice Department investigation into the company and numerous former colleagues.\n\nCorruption isn\u2019t exactly unheard of in the extraction and trading of commodities, especially in the developing world.\n\nBut details of Stimler\u2019s cooperation deal, obtained from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan and which haven\u2019t been reported before, offer a rare opportunity to see how it works \u2014 the scale, scope and almost routine nature of such transactions.\n\nOne aspect is the role of intermediaries, often favoured by governments in the region. The so-called briefcase companies act as conduits for traders\u2019 bribes to officials, taking a cut and directing state business back to the traders.\n\nGlencore was a dominant player in Nigeria, Chad, the Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea, and says it no longer uses intermediaries as part of a revamped and cleaned-up operation.\n\n\u201cAn issue that comes up with trader corruption is agents and intermediaries in the mix,\u201d said Alexandra Gillies, an adviser at the Natural Resource Governance Institute, which seeks to stamp out corruption in emerging market resources. \u201cClearly it\u2019s the top modus operandi for how these schemes work.\u201d\n\nGlencore of Baar, Switzerland, is one of a handful of firms that dominate global trading of oil, fuel, metals, minerals and food, middlemen who buy from producers and sell to refiners who turn the goods into finished products. It traces its roots to a company co-founded in 1974 by Marc Rich, a legendary trader and financier who fled the U.S. in 1983 to evade prosecution for trading with Iran during the American hostage crisis.\n\nIt had $142 billion in 2020 revenue.\n\nBefore getting caught, Stimler spent years in the game, beginning as early as 2007. And while it sounds like a hard-core business, he offers a mild-mannered profile. Affable and polite, he\u2019s known in his London Jewish community by the Yiddish nickname \u201cHershy\u201d and served on the board of Camp Simcha, which helps sick children. He took a two-year break in the middle of his tenure to care for his own child, who suffered from leukemia (and subsequently recovered).\n\nHis confession in July to foreign bribery and money laundering charges, the first ever by a Glencore trader, makes clear that he knew just what he\u2019d been doing \u2014 and that he didn\u2019t act alone. A lawyer for Stimler declined to comment for this article, as did Glencore. Stimler is out on bail in the U.K. and awaiting sentencing at a later date.\n\nIn that same year, 2017, prosecutors from the Justice Department\u2019s kleptocracy team filed a case in Houston to seize nearly $145 million worth of assets \u2014 including an $80 million, 215-foot yacht called the Galactica Star, a $50 million Billionaire\u2019s Row apartment in New York and homes in California \u2014 that it said were purchased for the benefit of Nigeria\u2019s oil minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, with embezzled funds.\n\n\u201cWhen I made requests for payments to intermediaries, I was aware that other Glencore traders who worked with me were doing the same thing by directing our intermediaries to make bribe payments to government officials,\u201d Stimler told a federal judge in New York, according to a transcript of his guilty plea.\n\n\u201cI intended that a proportion of the payment to intermediaries operating in Nigeria were to be passed on to Nigerian state-owned oil company officials. The purpose of the payment was to influence those officials\u2019 decisions regarding the Nigerian government\u2019s allocations of crude oil cargo.\n\n\u201cYour honor, I knew what I was doing was wrong and unlawful,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m extremely remorseful for my conduct.\u201d\n\nIt was conduct that was, nonetheless, handsomely rewarded.\n\nOver a two-decade career that began in 1998, Stimler, now 49, rose through the ranks of the storied Swiss trading house, becoming head of its West African oil trading desk.\n\nHe presided over a robust expansion of its crude flows and a nearly-doubling of his desk\u2019s annual profits to nearly $200 million in 2017, according to people familiar with internal data.\n\nIn that same year, 2017, prosecutors from the Justice Department\u2019s kleptocracy team filed a case in Houston to seize nearly $145 million worth of assets \u2014 including an $80 million, 215-foot yacht called the Galactica Star, a $50 million Billionaire\u2019s Row apartment in New York and homes in California \u2014 that it said were purchased for the benefit of Nigeria\u2019s oil minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, with embezzled funds.\n\nProsecutors said two associates of the minister set up companies shortly after she took office and were awarded contracts to sell large allotments of oil on global markets. The pair were awarded dozens of crude cargoes worth about $1.5 billion, according to the prosecutors. Nigeria received little of the proceeds of those sales, which prosecutors say were diverted for Madueke and her associates.\n\nProsecutors said two associates of the minister set up companies shortly after she took office and were awarded contracts to sell large allotments of oil on global markets.

Nigeria received little of the proceeds of those sales, which prosecutors say were diverted for Madueke and her associates. Related News NNPC bribes: Glencore staff Stimler pleads guilty in U.S.\n\nDiezani forfeits jewellery, houses worth N47.6billion\n\nJUSUN strike stalls Diezani\u2019s trial\n\nOne of the primary trading houses that stepped up to buy those cargoes, according to prosecutors: Glencore.\n\nThey say that over the course of 2013 and 2014, Glencore bought 15 cargoes totalling 7 million barrels from the men, paying more than $800 million. Of that, they contend, roughly a third \u2014 $272 million \u2014 was diverted into an account at a Nigerian bank used for the purchases for Madueke.\n\nIn assembling the case, prosecutors amassed evidence including bank records, emails and witness testimony. At least one recorded conversation showed that the minister worried about the scale of the graft. She chastised one of the associates that such high-profile purchases would attract the attention of authorities.\n\nShe was right.\n\nThey say that over the course of 2013 and 2014, Glencore bought 15 cargoes totaling 7 million barrels from the men, paying more than $800 million. Of that, they contend, roughly a third \u2014 $272 million \u2014 was diverted into an account at a Nigerian bank used for the purchases for Madueke.\n\nA court filing in Stimler\u2019s case makes reference to a \u201cForeign Official 1,\u201d a high-ranking Nigerian from 2010 to 2015, who had demanded and received bribery payments. According to people familiar with the matter, Madueke is Foreign Official 1. Lawyers for Madueke didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs prosecutors in the Houston case were going through the effort to seize the homes and yacht, Glencore received a Justice Department subpoena in July 2018 for documents related to Glencore\u2019s business in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela dating back to 2007, according to a company disclosure at the time.\n\nJust over a year later, Stimler left Glencore, a move wrongly viewed at the time as part of an executive shake-up following the departure of Alex Beard, Glencore\u2019s longtime head of oil trading and mentor to Stimler, according to a person familiar with them. It was around that time that Stimler began cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nNow Glencore and some of its executives face the prospect of steep fines and prison in a far-reaching investigation of tactics in numerous countries and commodity markets. U.S. authorities pursue such cases because, though they involve events in other countries, the payoffs were made in dollars that pass through the banking system in New York. Other major countries are also increasingly targeting commodity trading. U.S. authorities have gotten increasingly aggressive in enforcing laws against foreign bribery, imposing billions of dollars of fines against companies. Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, prosecutors can calculate fines based on how much a company sought to benefit from paying bribes, and then double the amount in imposing the penalty.\n\nGlencore says it\u2019s a changed company and is cooperating with prosecutors. It reserved a $216 million charge in the first half of the year for costs related to a specific element of several investigations it is facing.\n\nGary Nagle, Glencore\u2019s new chief executive, told reporters on a conference call in August that the company has adopted new compliance rules intended to eliminate illicit conduct, and that every person mentioned in Stimler\u2019s case has been disciplined or left the firm. The company is also reducing its business in high-risk jurisdictions, and no longer works with middlemen.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any intermediaries in our oil business,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different business model to what we used five to 10 years ago. We don\u2019t plan to use them again in our oil business.\u201d\n\nGlencore makes billions of dollars every year buying and selling commodities \u2014 above the money it makes digging metals, pumping crude or harvesting crops. In 2020, the company enjoyed its best trading ever, making $3.3 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, up 41% from the previous year despite the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy.\n\nStimler\u2019s guilty plea and the deal he cut with prosecutors will rattle fellow colleagues \u2013 and the company itself \u2013 as the Justice Department investigation continues.\n\nThe cooperation agreement requires him to disclose his and all his colleagues\u2019 activities relevant to the case, and agree to testify before a grand jury for the investigation and even serve as a government witness should any cases go to trial. He appeared by videoconference from the U.K. during his plea hearing, during which he told Judge Kevin Castel of Manhattan federal court that he\u2019d been assisting the Justice Department for more than two years.\n\nStimler has implicated seven others, including at least four Glencore traders, in making bribe payments, and authorities say the scheme started before him. One person named was a top African oil trader at Glencore dating back to the 1990s, Stimler\u2019s superior during his early rise there, according to people familiar with the matter; another worked with him on the West African oil trading during the latter part of the scheme, the people said.\n\nWhile Stimler began bribing in 2007, often using coded language in emails, the payments appear to have accelerated during Madueke\u2019s time in office, according to the court documents. Stimler agreed in late 2013 to pay more than triple the usual fees to an intermediary company that would be passed on as bribes for favorable grades and loading dates of Nigerian oil, his guilty plea says. Three months later, he and a colleague made another $500,000 payment to be eligible for additional Nigerian cargoes. Stimler \u201crequested and received approval\u201d for a Glencore subsidiary to make the payment, prosecutors said, without specifying who granted it.\n\nLater that fall, he received another request, saying Foreign Official 1 was seeking $300,000 per month from customers of Nigeria\u2019s national oil company, in connection with an upcoming election. Stimler authorised the payment, according to prosecutors.\n\nLater that fall, he received another request, saying Foreign Official 1 was seeking $300,000 per month from customers of Nigeria\u2019s national oil company, in connection with an upcoming election. Stimler authorized the payment, according to prosecutors.\n\nMadueke left office in 2015 and has been living in London. She has been charged with corruption by Nigerian authorities but has so far successfully evaded extradition, and she is under investigation by U.K. authorities as well. The yacht, the Galactica Star, has since been auctioned off. Its new owner is a shell company called Paxford Ltd., and it has been renamed Illusion. It was last seen docked on the coast of Sardinia, according to Bloomberg ship tracking data.\n\nIn May, Nigeria\u2019s national oil company released its new list of trading partners for the coming year, coveted contracts to buy its oil and sell it refined gasoline. Glencore was not among them.\n\n*Stimler\u2019s confession was first published by Bloomberg. It was republished by Yahoo Finance",

          "text": "The Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, is claimed to be experiencing a leadership crisis just four months after Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, nicknamed T.B Joshua, the church\u2019s founder, died.\n\nThe dilemma stems from the late Prophet\u2019s failure to establish a clear line of succession before to his death.\n\nRemember that T.B Joshua died on June 5, 2021, and was buried a few weeks later amid much pomp on the grounds of SCOAN. However, the succession dilemma began shortly after his burial.\n\nFollowing T.B Joshua\u2019s death, a leadership void developed between his widow and some of his disciples, who believed she lacked the qualifications to lead SCOAN.\n\nT.B Joshua kept his wife and family out of the public spotlight and church politics during his lifetime, according to DAILY POST, as evidenced by the fact that he withdrew Evelyn from SCOAN\u2019s Board of Trustees, BoT. She didn\u2019t participate in many church events.\n\nProphet Racine, Prophet Joseph, and Evangelist Chris primarily stepped in for T.B Joshua before his death, even if Mrs Evelyn Joshua was not present.\n\nThe leadership vacuum has deteriorated to the point where Joshua\u2019s followers and prophets have been targeted and tormented by Evelyn\u2019s board of directors.\n\nSome of T.B Joshua\u2019s disciples were ejected from their official housing in SCOAN over the weekend, while others were held prisoner in their rooms and had their phones taken from them forcibly.\n\nGoing all out, the Evelyn-led leadership also took several church officials to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for suspected theft of monies, including the prophets named above.\n\nDuring the squabble, Evelyn made an attempt to reclaim her place in the church\u2019s leadership.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that she obtained a court order restoring her to SCOAN\u2019s Board of Trustees, or BoT.\n\nMrs Evelyn was appointed as a trustee of SCOAN by Justice Tijani Ringim of the Lagos Federal High Court, in accordance with the church\u2019s Constitution, which requires a minimum of three trustees.\n\nMrs Evelyn\u2019s appointment is claimed to go against her late husband\u2019s decision to remove her from the board of directors before his death.\n\nOver the weekend, SCOAN confirmed Evelyn as the new leader of the church, putting an end to the succession struggle.\n\nThe church\u2019s legal team also disputed allegations that Evelyn-led leadership harassed some of the late Prophet\u2019s staff and devotees.\n\nJames Akhigbe, the Head of SCOAN Legal Department, said in a statement sighted by DAILY POST that some church workers and disciples are being audited over financial misappropriation shortly after T. B Joshua\u2019s death.\n\nAkhigbe, on the other hand, claimed that individuals affected have not been victimized in any way, and that the audit process is being carried out honestly in a regular and completely normal setting, free of harassment.\n\nIn response to the leadership squabble, Bishop Ufuoma Bernard of The Godist Church cautioned that Evelyn\u2019s rise could result in SCOAN\u2019s fortunes diminishing.\n\nMrs Evelyn was accused of \u201cmuscling\u201d her way into SCOAN\u2019s leadership when Bishop Bernard made the comment.\n\nThe clergyman described the widow as \u201ca Jezebel,\u201d and related how the riches of some large churches plummeted after the founders\u2019 wives seized over after their deaths.\n\nBernard claims that the church is not a family business.\n\n\u201cEvelyn Joshua is a Jezebel.\n\n\u201cWhen Nkechi Iluputaife took over from the murdered husband, the biggest church in Lagos, Victory Christian Church, at the time collapsed.\n\n\u201cWhen Margaret Idahosa used wayo to take over Church of God Mission after Benson Idahosa suffered cardiac arrest, the church dwindled in profile.\n\n\u201cNow Evelyn Joshua has muscled her way into the topmost position of Synagogue and certainly Synagogue is going down. The Church is not family business,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.",

          "text": "Both North Korea and South Korea test fired ballistic missiles on Wednesday, the latest volley in an arms race that has seen both countries develop increasingly sophisticated weapons while efforts to get talks going on defusing tension prove fruitless.\n\nSouth Korea tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile(SLBM), becoming the first country without nuclear weapons to develop such a system.\n\nSouth Korea President Moon was attending that test firing when word came of the North Korean launches, its first ballistic missile tests since March.\n\nNorth Korea fired a pair of ballistic missiles that landed in the sea off its east coast, according to officials in South Korea and Japan, just days after it tested a cruise missile that is believed to have nuclear capabilities.\n\nNorth Korea has been steadily developing its weapons systems amid a standoff over talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals in return for U.S. sanctions relief.\n\nThe negotiations, initiated between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018, have stalled since 2019.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea fired two unidentified ballistic missiles from its central inland region toward the east coast, and intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States are conducting detailed analysis for further information,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.\n\nThe missiles were fired just after 12:30 p.m. (0330 GMT), flying 800 km (497 miles) to a maximum altitude of 60 km (37 miles), the JCS reported.\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command said North Korea\u2019s missile launches did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, territory, or allies, but highlight the destabilising impact of its illicit weapons programme.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the missile launch \u201coutrageous\u201d and strongly condemned it as a threat to peace and security in the region.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing that China hoped \u201crelevant parties\u201d would \u201cexercise restraint\u201d.\n\n\u2018THE STRONGEST KOREA\u2019\n\nSouth Korea has been splurging on a range of new military systems, including ballistic missiles, submarines, and its first aircraft carrier. It has a stated policy of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.\n\nThe arms race has accelerated under Moon for a number of reasons, including his push for more foreign policy autonomy, wariness of relying on the United States after Trump\u2019s presidency and military developments in both North Korea and China, said Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King\u2019s College London.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea would face many political and legal obstacles to develop nuclear weapons, both internal and external,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it will develop all other capabilities to deter North Korea and show who the strongest Korea is.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the SLBM test announced the development of several other advanced missiles including a supersonic cruise missile and a ballistic missile with a larger warhead.\n\nMoon cited the nuclear-armed North\u2019s \u201casymmetric capabilities\u201d as a reason for South Korea to develop better missiles.\n\n\u201cEnhancing our missile capability is exactly what\u2019s needed as deterrence against North Korea\u2019s provocation,\u201d he said, while stressing that the SLBM test had been planned and was not in response to the North\u2019s launches.\n\nUnlike the South, North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile systems have been banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nIn November 2017, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the entire United States and declared it had become a nuclear power. It has since focused mainly on testing shorter-range missile and rockets.\n\nNorth Korea this year declared it was seeking to miniaturise nuclear warheads, which could potentially be fitted to tactical missiles.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea continues to prioritise military modernisation,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, international studies professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\n\u2018GREAT SIGNIFICANCE\u2019\n\nThe latest launch came as foreign ministers of South Korea and China held talks in Seoul amid concern over North Korea\u2019s tests and the stalled denuclearisation negotiations. read more\n\nNorth Korea said it successfully tested a new long-range cruise missile last weekend, calling it \u201ca strategic weapon of great significance\u201d. Analysts say that weapon could be its first cruise missile with a nuclear capability.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, when asked about the cruise missile tests, said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\n\n\u201cNot only North Korea but other countries are carrying out military activity,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAll of us should make efforts in a way that helps resume dialogue.\u201d\n\nIn a meeting with Wang on Wednesday, Moon asked for China\u2019s support to restart dialogue, saying North Korea had not been responding to South Korean and U.S. offers for talks or engagement such as humanitarian aid, Moon\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nThe nuclear envoys of South Korea, Japan, and the United States were meeting in Tokyo this week as well.\n\nU.S. envoy Sung Kim said on Tuesday the United States has no hostile intent towards North Korea and hoped it would respond positively to calls for talks.\n\nThe United States wants North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief. North Korea has refused.\n\nReuters",

The British parliamentarians who were singled out by China took the lead in a campaign to limit British investment in China by tabling a \u201cGenocide Amendment\u201d to trade legislation that was under consideration.\n\nAmong those sanctioned were former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee, and Helena Kennedy, a human rights lawyer who sits in the upper house.\n\nZheng had been due to address the All-Party Parliamentary China Group, which is made up of members from both houses of parliament, on Wednesday.

          "title": "Haiti Prime Minister Henry Sacks Prosecutor Who Accused Him of Links to President Moise\u2019s Assassination",
          "text": "Haiti\u2019s political crisis has worsened after Prime Minister Ariel Henry on Tuesday sacked the chief public prosecutor who had accused him of links to the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7.\n\nHenry\u2019s decision to fire prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude has exposed the infighting at the highest levels of what is left of Haiti\u2019s government, more than two months after Moise was shot dead by assassins who stormed his private residence in the hills above Port-au-Prince.\n\nClaude was sacked hours after he asked the judge investigating Moise\u2019s murder to charge the prime minister with involvement in the case.\n\n\u201cI have the pleasure of informing you that it was decided to terminate your post,\u201d Henry told Claude in a publicly distributed letter.\n\nHenry, a political moderate and neurosurgeon whom Moise named prime minister just days before his death in an attempt to reduce political tensions, has pledged to improve the country\u2019s dire security situation and to organise long-delayed elections. He was formally appointed to the rule days after Moise\u2019s assassination.\n\nClaude said last week that phone records showed Henry had twice communicated with a man believed to be the mastermind behind Moise\u2019s killing on the night of the crime.\n\nThat suspect, a former justice ministry official whom Henry has publicly defended, is now on the run.\n\nHenry dismissed the prosecutor\u2019s request to discuss the matter as politicking and did not respond to the allegations.\n\nThat prompted Claude to write on Tuesday to the judge overseeing the investigation into Moise\u2019s murder and ask him to charge Henry as a suspect.\n\nHe also wrote to immigration telling them not to let Henry leave the country \u201cdue to serious presumption relative to the assassination of the president\u201d.\n\nLater on Tuesday, a letter from Henry to Claude dated September 13 emerged in which he said he was firing the prosecutor for a \u201cgrave administrative error\u201d, without going into detail. In a separate letter dated September 14, he named Frantz Louis Juste to the post.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the order is valid as Haiti\u2019s 1987 constitution mandates that the prosecutor can only be appointed or fired by the president, a position that remains vacant.\n\nSome legal experts expressed alarm at Claude\u2019s requests for Henry to be questioned and charged, seeing the prosecutor\u2019s move as an impediment to the independence of the judiciary.\n\nSome in government circles had also called in recent days for the prime minister to resign over the allegations.\n\n\u201cThese are grotesque and political acts,\u201d Samuel Madistin, a lawyer for a human rights organisation, told the AFP news agency.\n\nDecades of political instability, as well as natural catastrophes, have plagued Haiti\u2019s development. Its aid-dependent economy is the poorest in the Americas, more than a third of Haitians face acute food insecurity, and gangs have turned swathes of the capital into no-go areas.\n\nSo far, 44 people \u2013 including 18 Colombians and two Americans of Haitian descent \u2013 have been arrested in connection with the inquiry into the assassination. None of the president\u2019s security guards was injured in the attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely convoluted state of affairs,\u201d Michael Diebert, a journalist and author who has covered Haiti for more than 20 years, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of doubt among people in Haiti about whether this investigation will be allowed to run its course. Most of the people who have been arrested so far, I don\u2019t think anyone seriously thinks they were the money men or the real intellectual authors of this crime.\u201d\n\nSome 44 people have been picked up in connection with the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, who was shot dead in his home on July 7 [File: Estailove St-Val/Reuters]\n\nHenry on Saturday criticised the earlier request for him to be questioned, saying: \u201cThese diversionary tactics, designed to create confusion and prevent justice from calmly running its course, will not stand.\n\n\u201cThose who are truly guilty, the masterminds of the odious assassination of President Jovenel Moise and those who ordered it, will be found, brought to justice and punished for their actions.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, the prime minister announced that Haiti\u2019s main political forces had reached an agreement to establish a transitional government until the holding of presidential elections and a referendum on whether to adopt a new constitution next year.\n\nThe agreement establishes a Council of Ministers under Henry\u2019s leadership.",
          "summary": "Haiti\u2019s political crisis has worsened after Prime Minister Ariel Henry on Tuesday sacked the chief public prosecutor who had accused him of links to the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7.\nClaude was sacked hours after he asked the judge investigating Moise\u2019s murder to charge the prime minister with involvement in the case.\nHe was formally appointed to the rule days after Moise\u2019s assassination.\nHe also wrote to immigration telling them not to let Henry leave the country \u201cdue to serious presumption relative to the assassination of the president\u201d.\nSome in government circles had also called in recent days for the prime minister to resign over the allegations.",
