          "text": "About two months to the fourth-year anniversary of the abduction of Leah Sharibu by Boko Haram terrorists, her parents have expressed disappointment in the body language of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), towards her freedom.\n\nNathan and Rebecca Sharibu said they were tired of speaking, crying and pleading with a government that had remained deaf to every legitimate demand to free their daughter.\n\nThey barred their minds in an interview with The PUNCH through the spokesperson for and Executive Director of the Leah Foundation, Dr Gloria Puldu.\n\nLeah Sharibu was one of the 110 female students of the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, who were abducted on February 19, 2018, by Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nWhile others were released by the terrorists following negotiations, Leah, then 14 year-old, is still being held captive because she refused to renounce her Christian faith.\n\nPuldu said, \u201cThank you very much for your concern. Let me tell you how the family has agreed to spend this Christmas. They said they were tired of speaking, crying and pleading with the government of Buhari, which is deaf to every call.\n\n\u201cSo, it is agreed that they should remain silent and just call for continued prayers. They said they were tired of routine calls, which hurt so much that they had to just call on anyone who wished to stand with them to do so only in prayers.\n\n\u201cWe wish to respect the family\u2019s wishes. We have only sent out Christmas greetings by calling for prayers.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Gideon and Funmi Para-Mallam Peace Foundation, on Sunday, released a video calling for the release of Leah.\n\nA renowned peace advocate and Executive Director of the organisation, Rev Gideon Para-Mallam, appealed to Buhari to facilitate the release of Leah.\n\nHe said, \u201cCelebrating her fourth Christmas in captivity, I decided as I have always done every Christmas since 2018, to release a video appealing to all in Nigeria and the world to work assiduously for her release and the release of more young girls and women who remain in captivity.\n\n\u201cSilence is no answer to this present challenge! Leah is not just a citizen of this nation. She belongs to a family! Oh what pain her parents, father Nathan, mum Rebecca, and brother Nathan, other siblings and the entire family!\n\n\u201cTheir hearts must be bleeding as Leah\u2019s has bled all these years because of this involuntary separation. Oh God, my Ebenezer, arise with healing and deliverance in your wings and set your daughters, Leah, Alice Ngaddah, Grace Tuka, Lilian Gyang Daniel, Praise, Mwanret, Hauwa, Jamaba, Caroline, Christiana, Jummai, the three other Graces, and others too numerous to mention by name, free.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Borno State Governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, has urged his promoters on social media platforms to stop comparing his performance with those of his colleagues in other states.\n\nHe said his administration\u2019s developmental aggression was not driven by competition.\n\nZulum\u2019s appeal was contained in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Public Relations and Strategy, Isa Gusau, on Monday.\n\nThe statement quoted Zulum to have said, \u201cWhile I am enormously grateful for all the supports and promotions, I have in recent days received messages forwarded to me, in which our work-in-progress in Borno State is being compared with some states, and in some cases, with insults.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that I feel extremely uncomfortable any time I am being negatively compared with any governor, especially if anyone of those making the comparisons fall in any of the social media groups associated with us.\n\n\u201cI consider such comparisons unhealthy. Moreover, we are not in competition. The truth is that all of the 36 states have their peculiarities and priorities, depending on developmental plans and the needs of societies.\n\n\u201cIn Borno\u2019s case, we have to be desperate in our recovery efforts because we have been faced with 12 years of war, resulting to thousands of deaths and displacement of about two million people with humanitarian needs.\n\n\u201cFrom the World Bank\u2019s Recovery and Peace-Building Assessment report on the North East, Borno lost 956,453 private houses, representing 30 % of the total number of houses across the state, to insurgent destructions.\n\n\u201cAlso, 665 municipal buildings comprising ministries, LGA buildings, prisons, police stations and electric offices were destroyed in Borno.\n\n\u201c5,335 classrooms and other school buildings were destroyed in 512 primary schools, 38 secondary schools and two tertiary institutions in the State.\n\n\u201c201 health centres, mostly primary healthcare clinics, dispensaries and some General Hospitals were all destroyed. The insurgents also destroyed 726 power substations and distribution lines just like they destroyed 1,630 water sources including motorized boreholes, hand pumps, solar powered boreholes and facilities for piped water schemes, and more.\u201d\n\nZulum explained that his administration\u2019s developmental aggression is not driven by competition, but the realities of unquantifiable challenges.\n\n\u201cAll states have different needs hence, leaders respond differently and with different strategies.\n\n\u201cWe in Borno needed to act fast given our peculiarity of needs, but this should not be a basis for negative comparison,\u201d the governor added.\n\nGusau said that his principal \u201cappeals to anyone who genuinely supports him not to insult any leader on the basis of whatever is being achieved in Borno State.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Obasanjo wrote Shagari alleging coup ahead of his inauguration \u2013 Amb Ukume",
          "text": "*Awolowo refused to join coup,said he preferred dying on hospital bed than through bullet,he claims\n\n* Explains how Joseph Tarka foiled plot\n\n*Alex Ekwueme was not NPN\u2019s choice as Shagari\u2019s VP, he says\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013NIGERIA\u2019s Second Republic ambassador to Cote D\u2019Ivoire,Denis Ukume,has revealed that General Olusegun Obasanjo had informed Alhaji Shehu Shagari that his inauguration as first civilian president following his victory in the August 11,1979 presidential election would be preceded by coup by a group of soldiers loyal to General Iliya Bisalla, earlier executed over complicity in a coup.\n\nHe also said Dr Alex Ekwueme was not the choice of the National Party of Nigeria,NPN,as vice presidential candidate to Alhaji Shehu Shagari, revealing that the baton fell on Ekwueme after the party\u2019s preferred candidate,Chief Ralph Nwuechue,an old boy of St.John\u2019s College,Kaduna,and prominent Ibo personality, declined the offer on account of his father\u2019s terminal illness at the time.\n\nREAD ALSO:Christmas: Reps\u2019 minority caucus not happy Nigerians can\u2019t afford basic needs of life\n\nUkume said Obasanjo communicated Shagari through the Federal Electoral Commission,FEDECO Chairman, Chief Michael Ani,that security report had indicated that a possible coup was to be staged ahead of Shagari\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAccording to him, Obasanjo hinged his allegation on security report which he claimed to have received as Head of State after the election and subsequent declaration of Shagari as president-elect by FEDECO.\n\nBut he claimed that a statement made by the former Minister of Communication and NPN chieftain, Joseph Tarka,at a meeting the party convened ahead of the inauguration prevented the coup plotters from going ahead. He, however, did not mention the statement made by the late politician.\n\nUkume\u2019s claims were contained in his published 76-paged book,titled:\u201dOSOFINCO-The brief untold story of Late Senator Tarka\u201d,which he launched alongside three others in Abuja.\n\nIn the letter by Obasanjo,Ukume claimed the late sage,Obafemi Awolowo,was implicated in the planned coup. But he said the late first premier of Western Region declined to participate in the coup allegedly spearheaded by late Dr Waziri Ibrahim,who had contested the presidential election alongside Shehu Shagari.\n\nThese claims were found in chapter six of the published book which he captioned :\u201dShehu Shagari\u2019s inauguration:Head of State Obasanjo warn Shagari of coup plot,Tarka saves the day.\u201d\n\nIt read:\u201dAs the country waited anxiously but patiently for the inauguration of President-Elect Shehu Shagari,no one paid any undue attention to the messenger who had arrived at the NPN Secretariat with a letter from Chief Michael Ani, FEDECO Chairman, addressed to Shehu Shagari,the president-elect.\n\n\u201cThe president-elect called me into his office and handed me a single-sheet, handwritten document, warning that it was confidential and should be in treated as such. I should make a photocopy,just one photocopy and return it to him immediately. The copying machine at the secretariat had broken down,so I went to the nearest commercial centre.\n\n\u201cSeveral customers were milling around when I got there. I offered the machine attendant N2,000 and he ordered everyone out of the room. The first copy did not come out well but the second did.\n\n\u201cI picked up the copy and the soiled one and went straight to Shagari. Handed back the original and the clean copy to him and kept the soiled one. The messenger left almost immediately with the letter he had brought. I returned to my office and decided to read the content of the soiled copy. Because the president-elect had warned about the confidential nature of the note,I dared not spend even a minute in perusing it.\n\n\u201cI was petrified as I quickly read the document and shredded it. Not a word to any of my colleagues,who would be amazed when they read this book.\n\n\u201cFEDECO Chairman, Chief Michael Ani had attached his own note addressed to Shagari informing him that the document had come from Head of State Obasanjo with instruction to be forwarded to him for information. And that it should be returned to his office. He explained that the document was based on a security report.\n\n\u201cThe document stated that a meeting was convened by the late Dr Waziri Ibrahim who had contested the presidential election alongside Shehu Shagari. Chief Obafemi Awolowo and others attended the meeting.\n\n\u201cWaziri explained at the meeting that he was part of a group of 5,000 soldiers in the Nigerian Army who were calling themselves, the \u201cBisalla Group.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir mission was to avenge the killing of General Bisalla. They vowed that the inauguration of Shagari would not take place as they had planned to disrupt it. Dr Waziri Ibrahim was reported in the document as inviting Chief Awolowo to join them.\n\n\u201cCalling Dr Waziri \u201cmy friend\u201d, as reported in the document, Awolowo refused outright to be part of the plan, instead he pleaded with Dr Waziri to discontinue the planned evil act. When Dr Waziri pressed further,Chief Awolowo was adamant. He would rather die on a hospital bed than through the bullet of a gun,he was quoted as saying.\u201d\n\nRecalling however that,\u201dDr Waziri Ibrahim preached politics without bitterness throughout his electioneering campaigns\u201d,Amb. Ukume noted that:\u201dShagari\u2019s inauguration, however,went smoothly without untoward incident.\u201d\n\nUkume further said:\u201d A private inauguration dinner was hosted that evening by the veritable elder statesman,Chief Oni Anyaru of blessed memory memory at his residence in Victoria Island,Lagos. A schoolmate and friend, the late General Jallo,the Chief of Staff, Nigerian Army and my good friend, Senator Mahmud Waziri of blessed memory both called me aside at separate moments to appreciate Senator J.S.Tarka for saving Nigeria. It was what Senator Tarka had said, they both explained,that had derailed the planned coup d\u2019etat.\n\n\u201cI quickly went up to Senator Tarka who also attended the party to whisper to him the gossip that was circulating the hall. He was apparently quite oblivious of what he was reported to have said,and humorously asked me to remind him about it.\u201d\n\nHow Ekwueme emerged Shagari\u2019s vice presidential running mate:\n\nHear him:\u201dThe NPN was gearing up to embark on a nation-wide electioneering campaign,and a search for a suitable vice presidential candidate preferably of mid-westerrn Ibo extraction had began in earnest.\n\n\u201cSeveral prominent Ibo personalities including the late Chuba Okadigbo,and K.O. Mbadiwe touted as suitable candidate did not meet that criteria.\n\n\u201cTarka walked into my office at the NPN National Secretariat one morning,and the name that came readily to his mind was Chief Ralph Nwuechue,an old boy of St. John\u2019s College, Kaduna, and prominent Ibo personality. He said I should called Ralph Nwuechue immediately. He spoke with him. Ralph Nwuechue expressed great delight at being considered for the elevated position of vice president of Nigeria. But he regretted he would not accept the offer. His father,he explained,was terminally ill with cancer,and he needed time to spend with him,he stated.\n\n\u201cAt that point,the late Chief Francis Mordi,a friend and Tarka\u2019s political aide,and I reminded Tarka of the humble architect Chief Alex Ekwueme who lived in London. The federal government accepted his architectural designs for the construction of colleges of education buildings throughout the country.\n\n\u201cTarka spoke briefly with Alex Ekwueme,and several weeks later,he was invited to Lagos,and was confirmed as the vice presidential candidate of the NPN.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026I will wait for Police 24 hours to release Nwosu \u2013 Okorocha\n\n\u2026We apologize to the Anglican church, we are against banditry in Imo \u2013 CAN\n\n\u2026Linking Nwosu\u2019s arrest to church, plot to de-emphasise criminality \u2013 Imo govt\n\n\u2026Says Uzodimma holds the Anglican church in high esteem\n\nBy Chinonso Alozie, Owerri\n\nThe Archbishop, Anglican Province of Owerri, Most Rev Dr David O. C Onuoha, on Monday said the church would engage the Nigeria Police Force to know the reasons behind what led to the invasion and arrest of the Imo state 2019 governorship candidate, Uche Nwosu, last Sunday, at St Peters Anglican church at Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo state.\n\nThe Anglican Bishop, spoke in a statement to newsmen in Owerri while reacting to the incident at the Anglican church in Nkwerre local government area of Imo state.\n\nAccording to the Anglican Bishop, \u201cIt was a black Sunday yesterday December 26, 2021, as armed men in uniform invaded St Peter\u2019s Anglican Church Eziama Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area, Diocese of Orlu in Imo State and roundly desecrated God\u2019s sanctuary. The officiating priest had barely concluded the celebration and administration of the Holy Eucharist, ready for the end of year thanksgiving when armed men stormed the church. The Nigerian Police later explained that it was to effect an arrest.\n\n\u201cMuch as we are not concerned or interested in the reason for this invasion, which is unprecedented in the more than 160 years history of the church in this state, we are gravely worried and disturbed that worshippers were greatly frightened, worried, confused and completely disorganized by the presence of heavily armed security operatives in the church service thereby disrupting the worship of God\u2019s people.\n\n\u201cThat the police jumped inside the church in a Gestapo style when the service was in full session is reprehensible, primitive, and highly condemnable. We are at a great loss why the police decided to throw caution to the winds and completely ignore internationally acclaimed rules of engagement and civility in this matter.\n\n\u201cThe sporadic gunshots outside the church building sent worshippers scampering in different directions, signalling an abrupt and chaotic end of the service.\n\n\u201cWhile the church is in support of and have always been praying for the success of our security personnel in the daunting task and challenge of securing lives and property in our dear state and every effort at bringing the perpetrators/sponsors of this crime against humanity to book no matter how highly placed, we warn that such acts as the one in issue are capable of worsening the security challenges we are currently facing.\n\n\u201cThe Church will in the next few days engage the Nigerian Police in a dialogue to truly understand the reasons behind this dastardly act and how to avoid a repeat occurrence. While this process is on, we urge all Christians to continue in prayers for God\u2019s mercy on all of us and peace in our land.\u201d\n\nI will wait for Police 24 hours to release Nwosu \u2013 Okorocha\n\nAdding his voice, The former governor of Imo state and the Senator representing Imo West Senatorial District, Rochas Okorocha, said he would wait for the next 24 hours for the police to free and release officially the offence of his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, who was arrested last Sunday.\n\nOkorocha was captured yesterday by Vanguard in Owerri, while he (Okorocha) reacted to the arrest of Nwosu, at St Peters Anglican Church in Eziama, Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo state, during an outing service of Nwosu\u2019s late mother.\n\nHe said that 24 hours was enough legally for the police to make public the offence of Nwosu and failure to do that he (Okorocha) would take legal action to demand his release.\n\nAs captured by Vanguard from Okorocha, \u201cI am going to wait for 24 hours to know what Nwosu has done. We want to know his offences. 24 hours is enough for the police to do that which is legal. They should let the world know about his offences and failure to do that I will take legal action to demand his release.\u201d\n\nThis is coming as Nwosu, who was the Imo state 2019 governorship candidate of the Action Alliance, AA, arrested last Sunday, has spent a night in the police custody as the police were yet to officially state his offences or make official that he has been released.\n\nJust as his supporters were expecting that their boss could have been granted bail based on personal recognition and his status in society.\n\nAlso speaking, according to the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Imo state chapter, led by Reverend Eches Divine Eches said: \u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria Imo state chapter hereby apologise to the Anglican Church over the recent incident of the arrest of Uche Nwosu in one of its parishes. We believe that this could have been avoided.\n\n\u201cAs the umbrella body of Christians in the state, we support efforts by security agencies to bring any person fingered of involvement in any form of criminality in the state, to book. But the security agencies must be mindful of their mode of operations to avoid offending the sensitivity of our people and unwittingly allowing detractors to rubbish their good works.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it abundantly clear that we support the Imo state government and the authorities in their determined efforts to rid the state of banditry and any kind of criminality in the state.\n\n\u201cSince nobody is above the law, government and security agencies should not relent in taking actions that would lead to the arrest and prosecution of anybody who has questions to answer,\u201d CAN say.\n\nLinking Nwosu\u2019s arrest to church, plot to de-emphasise criminality \u2013 Imo govt\n\nReacting also, the Imo state government through the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said: \u201cAccording to the Imo government, \u201cThe Imo State Government is aware of the futile efforts by some people to whip up public sentiments against it over the arrest in an Anglican Church of Mr Uche Nwosu. The plan is to de-emphasise the possible criminality behind his arrest by playing up the desecration of a church.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, while the government believes that no stone should be spared in the effort to rid the state of criminality and banditry, it will not support any form of disrespect for a place of worship by security agencies. In this regard, the arrest of Mr Nwosu within the church premises could have been avoided and therefore stands condemned.\n\n\u201cWhile government regrets the manner the arrest was made we wish to emphasize that since it was purely a security matter, the full reason why such an action was taken will eventually unfold, and perhaps guide the public better.\n\n\u201cGovernment, therefore, wishes to appeal to those negatively affected by the action to bear with the security agencies. His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma holds the Anglican Communion in very high esteem and will never support any act that will disrespect her reverential status as a place of Divine worship. The government will continue to protect the interest of citizens of the state while not impeding the work of security agencies,\u201d Government said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

I consider such comparisons unhealthy. Moreover, we are not in competition.\n\nThe truth is that all of the 36 States have their peculiarities and priorities, depending on developmental plans and the needs of societies. In Borno\u2019s case, we have to be desperate in our recovery efforts because we have been faced with 12 years of war, resulting to thousands of deaths and displacement of about two million people with humanitarian needs.\n\nFrom the World Bank\u2019s Recovery and Peace-Building Assessment report on the northeast, Borno lost 956,453 private houses, representing 30 % of the total number of houses in across the state, to insurgent destructions.\n\nREAD ALSO: Zulum urges rousing welcome for Buhari\n\nAlso, 665 municipal buildings comprising ministries, LGA buildings, prisons, police stations and electric offices were destroyed in Borno. 5,335 classrooms and other school buildings were destroyed in 512 primary schools, 38 secondary schools and two tertiary institutions in the State. 201 health centres, mostly primary healthcare clinics, dispensaries and some General Hospitals were all destroyed.\n\nThe insurgents also destroyed 726 power substations and distribution lines just like they destroyed 1,630 water sources including motorized boreholes, hand pumps, solar powered boreholes and facilities for piped water schemes, and more.\n\nSo, our developmental aggression in Borno is not driven by competition, but our realities of unquantifiable challenges.

Today INEC requires N305 billion for the 2023 general elections. Now if the general election, which is not the newly proposed electoral system, will cost this much, how much will it cost to do the same election in the APC?

In achieving this objective, the Act did not only improve on the provisions of the erstwhile Act, it has its own novel provisions.\u201d\n\nHURIWA pointed the need for the observance of the right to the human dignity of the person said to be in conflict with the law.\n\nHURIWA restated that in ensuring that the new Police Act fulfils its objectives, provisions were made in accordance with global best practices and in compliance with some recent National Laws on Administration of Justice in Nigeria. This is to eliminate the areas of seeming discrepancies between the old Police Act and other corresponding national Legislations.\n\nHURIWA said the violent abduction of Uche Nwosu from the Church and the attack on his wife and his mother in law by the arresting armed officers clearly violates the provision of the new Police Act on the Notification of Next of Kin.\n\nHURIWA said the deployment of physical torture violates both the newly domesticated anti-torture legislation and its provision in the 2020 Police Act that outlaws Torture and Inhumane Treatment just as the New Act provides for the right to the dignity of the human person as a fundamental right guaranteed in the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cA person who is arrested must also be granted this right. He must not be subjected to any form of torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. This provision is also included in Section8(1) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2015. \u201c",

          "text": "By Bola Olajuwon, Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja and Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, former president Olusegun Obasanjo, ex-United States President Barack Obama and other world leaders yesterday joined South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa mourning Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu.\n\nRamaphosa announced the passing of the outspoken Nobel Peace Prize laureate and anti-apartheid veteran. He was 90.\n\nHe described his demise as another chapter \u201cof bereavement in the nation\u2019s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans, who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari and Chief Obasanjo the late archbishop as a famous cleric, who never shied away from confronting global and South Africa\u2019s shortcomings and injustices.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, former U.S. President and Nobel Peace laureate Jimmy Carter; British Prime Minister Boris Johnson; India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi; Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema; Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama are among the world leaders who mourned Tutu\u2019s passage.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, Buhari commiserated with his South African counterpart, the Tutu family, especially his spouse, Mrs. Leah Tutu, and South Africans over the passage of the global hero.\n\nPresident Buhari assured that the contributions of the late archbishop\u2019s contributions to humanity, recorded through his voice, writings and activities would resonate over generations.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cOn behalf of government and people of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari condoles with President Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africans and the global Christian body, particularly Anglican Communion, over passing of Archbishop Emeritus, Desmond Tutu, 90, on Sunday, December 26, 2021.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari believes the death of the iconic teacher, human rights activist, leader of thought, scholar and philanthropist, further creates a void in a world in dire need of wisdom, integrity, courage and sound reasoning, which were qualities that the Nobel Peace Prize Winner, 1984, typified and exemplified in words and actions.\n\n\u201cAs a South African, global citizen and renowned world leader, the President affirms that the historic role Archbishop Tutu played in the fight against apartheid, enduring physical assaults, jail terms and prolonged exile, took him beyond the pulpit to global, political relevance, and his position, under President Nelson Mandela, in heading the Truth and Reconciliation Commission provided healing and direction for his country and the world.\u201d\n\nIn a condolence letter to Ramaphosa, Obasanjo recalled the role played by the late Tutu in getting Nigeria\u2019s debt cancelled.\n\nChief Obasanjo said: \u201cOver the years, Reverend Tutu had shown focused, credible, bold, sensitive and purposeful leadership not just to members of the Anglican Church, but to all Christians.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which was released to the media by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, added: \u201cTutu had been part of building and strengthening the Anglican Church, and its eminent place in the Church system in South Africa today is not unrelated to his selfless service and leadership\u201d.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s debt cancellation, Obasanjo said he acknowledged late Tutu\u2019s \u201cuncommon solidarity and the deep passion with which he had argued Nigeria\u2019s case for full debt cancellation by the contents of his letter to Mr. Gordon Brown, the then UK\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer, during my administration as the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis heroic advocacy effort of his with respect to Nigeria\u2019s indebtedness to the Paris Club on behalf of Nigeria was very much in his character.\u201d\n\nAlso, Governor Dapo Abiodun expressed grief over the death of the South African anti-apartheid hero.\n\nAbiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, said he was shocked by the death of the anti-apartheid hero.\n\nTo Obama, the late archbishop was a towering figure and \u201cmoral compass\u201d, who fought against injustice in South Africa and elsewhere\u201d.\n\nObama, in a statement, said the Nobel Peace laureate \u201cwas a mentor, a friend and a moral compass for me and so many others.\n\n\u201cA universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,\u201d Obama said, adding that Tutu sought to \u201cfind humanity in his adversaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichelle and I will miss him dearly,\u201d he said.\n\nObama in 2009 presented Tutu with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nCarter, in his condolence, described him as a friend whose ministry he said exemplified \u201clove, freedom and compassion\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe lived his values in the long struggle to end apartheid in South Africa, in his leadership of the national campaign for truth and reconciliation, and in his role as a global citizen,\u201d Carter, age 97, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHis warmth and compassion offered us a spiritual message that is eternal.\u201d\n\nAlso, Johnson tweeted: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. He was a critical figure in the fight against apartheid and in the struggle to create a new South Africa.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe British PM said he will remember Tutu for his spiritual leadership and irrepressible good humour.\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said Desmond Tutu transformed the people around the world while he lived.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page yesterday, Welby described Tutu as a man who showed extraordinary courage and bravery.\n\n\u201cArch\u2019s love transformed the lives of politicians and priests, township dwellers and world leaders. The world is different because of this man,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dArchbishop Tutu was a prophet and priest, a man of words and action, one who embodied the hope and joy that were the foundations of his life.\n\n\u201dHe was a man of extraordinary personal courage and bravery: when the police burst into Cape Town Cathedral, he defied them by dancing down the aisle.\n\n\u201cHe was a man of enormous vision: seeing the possibilities for building the Rainbow Nation long before anyone else, except perhaps President Mandela.\n\n\u201cHis vision and bravery were allied with a canny political sense and wisdom, enabling him to be a healer and apostle of peace while so many still saw wounds and war.\n\nThe African National Congress (ANC) joined South Africans and the global community in mourning the sad passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu.\n\n\u201cIndeed the big baobab tree has fallen. South Africa and the mass democratic movement have lost a tower of moral conscience and an epitome of wisdom.\n\n\u201cWe extend our revolutionary condolences to his wife Mama Leah Tutu, his family, friends as well as colleagues at the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation. May Archbishop Desmond Tutu\u2019s soul rest in eternal peace,\u201d the ANC said.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation also paid tribute, saying Tutu\u2019s \u201ccontributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies.\n\n\u201cHe was an extraordinary human being; a thinker; a leader; a shepherd.\u201d\n\nHe retired from public life in 2010.\n\nModi said Tutu was a \u201cguiding light\u201d for countless people globally.\n\n\u201cHis emphasis on human dignity and equality will be forever remembered. I am deeply saddened by his demise, and extend my heartfelt condolences to all his admirers. May his soul rest in peace,\u2019\u2019 he said on Twitter.\n\nHichilema said he was saddened by Tutu\u2019s passing, describing the late cleric as a \u201cgallant son of the African soil who fought against the injustices of humanity\u201d.\n\nHe said Tutu belonged to \u201ca generation of selfless African leaders that gallantly challenged the injustices of apartheid and racial subjugation against the African people in South Africa and other marginalized people around the world.\u201d\n\nIn his condolence message, Kenyan President described the late Tutu as an African icon of freedom, peace, and reconciliation and termed his death a blow to Africa as a whole where he is deeply respected and celebrated as a peacemaker.\n\nThe Dalai Lama wrote a letter of condolence to Archbishop Tutu\u2019s daughter, Rev Mpho Tutu, praising the archbishop for being a \u201ctrue humanitarian\u201d and a committed advocate for human rights.\n\n\u201cWith his passing away, we have lost a great man, who lived a truly meaningful life,\u201d the Dalai Lama said from his home in Dharamsala in northern India.\n\n\u201cHe was devoted to the service of others, especially those who are least fortunate. I am convinced the best tribute we can pay him and keep his spirit alive is to do as he did and constantly look to see how we too can be of help to others.\u201d\n\nThe two men enjoyed a close and long friendship and met on many occasions, most notably in 2015 when Tutu spent a week in Dharamsala when they grappled with the problem of how to increase peace and joy in the world.\n\nTutu served as the first Black archbishop at the St. Georges Cathedral in Cape Town in the 1980s and won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe was the last surviving South African laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize.",

          "title": "Constitution review: Senate forecloses state creation",
          "text": "The Senate has ruled out the creation of new states, it was learnt on Sunday.\n\nThe Senate Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution observed that, apart from shrinking resources, which may render additional states unviable, the exercise may fuel national tension and further polarise the country.\n\nThere are agitations across the six geo-political zones that states should be increased from 36 to 56.\n\nHowever, the Senate Committee reasoned that the new states will create additional burden for the country.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan, who spoke on the report of the Constitution Review, said the recommendations, which would be harmonised before the Constitution Amendment Bill is passed, will top the agenda of the Senate after the Christmas recess.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThere are over 30 items in the report of the Senate Committee on Constitutional Review, it was learnt.\n\nAccording to the report, the 70-year retirement age limit for Supreme Court and Court of Appeal justices will now be extended to all judges nationwide.\n\nAppeal Court as final arbitor on election cases\n\nIt was also gathered that election matters or petitions are now to end at the Court of Appeal, instead of recourse to the Supreme Court.\n\nUntil some few years ago, the Court of Appeal was the final arbiter on election petitions.\n\nTo decongest the Supreme Court, the apex court may no longer adjudicate on some matters like land and marital issues.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers are pushing for the decentralisation of the Nigeria Police, including financial autonomy for state and zonal commands.\n\nAccording to investigation, in spite of the fact that a recommendation has been made for referendum to be conducted for 20 new states by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Senate may not go ahead with the exercise again.\n\nA source, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cWe have realised that the nation\u2019s resources are limited and cannot accommodate new states.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done so far was to document the requests for new states and those 20 we wanted INEC to conduct referendum about for future sake.\n\nArgument against state creation\n\n\u201cWe have also observed that most states are unviable and there is no basis creating additional burdens for the country.\u201d\n\nA member of the Senate Committee on Constitution Review said: \u201cWe are no longer considering agitation for state creation because there is a new development with the call for restructuring.\n\n\u201cIf the nation bows to the pressure for restructuring, it is a bigger picture than state creation. So, restructuring is taking the centre stage.\n\n\u201cIt is even apparent that we have weak states. There is no basis for new ones. Besides, state creation can lead to more political discord and tension in the country. We do not want to add to the security challenges nationwide.\n\n\u201cSome geo-political zones are not keen on new states. The polarisation in Northcentral alone can lead to a major crisis in the zone. It appears only the Southeast is more coherent in its demand for a new state.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to meet the conditions for creation of new states without political rancour. We cannot and should not add to the prevalent tension in the country.\u201d\n\nConstitutional provisions\n\nThe Section in Part 1 of Chapter 1 of the 1999 Constitution on state creation states the conditions as follows:\n\n\u201cAn Act of the National Assembly for the purpose of creating a new state shall only be passed if \u2013\n\n(a) a request, supported by at least two-thirds majority of members (representing the area demanding the creation of the new state) in each if the following \u2013\n\n(i) the Senate and the House of Representatives\n\n(ii) the House of Assembly in respect of the area, and\n\n(iii) the local government councils in respect of the area, is received by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cA proposal for the creation of the state is thereafter approved in a referendum in by at least two-thirds majority of the people of the area where the demand for creation of the state originated.\n\n\u201cThe result of the referendum is then approved by a simple majority of all the states of the Federation supported by a simple majority of members of the Houses of Assembly, and\n\n\u201cThe proposal is approved by a resolution passed by two-thirds majority of members of each House of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Committee member added: \u201cState creation is no longer on the card as far as the ongoing constitution review is concerned.\u201d\n\nProposed states\n\nSome of the requests for new states are Itai State (from Akwa Ibom State); State status for the FCT; Katagum State from Bauchi State; Okura State from Kogi East; Adada State from Enugu State; Gurara State from Kaduna South; and Ijebu State from Ogun State\n\nOthers are Ibadan State from Oyo State; Tiga State from Kano State; Ghari State from Kano State; Amana State from Adamawa; Gongola State from Adamawa; Mambilla State from Taraba State; Savannah State from Borno State; and Okun state from Kogi State.\n\nAlso on the list are Etiti State from the South East Zone; Orashi State from Imo and Anambra states; Njaba from Imo State or the excision of Aba State from Abia State; Anioma State from Delta State; Torogbene and Oil River States, from Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers states; and Bayajida State from parts of Katsina, Jigawa and Zamfara states.\n\nOn the recommendations of a \u201cuniform 70-year retirement age limit for High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court judges,\u201d a source said: \u201cIn the proposed amendment to 1999 Constitution, hearing of election matters or petitions will henceforth be concluded at the Court of Appeal, instead of the Supreme Court. We are returning to the previous practice, we do not want to overburden the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAlso, we are going to oust the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on some matters like land dispute, marital cases, child paternity and others. We want a Supreme Court with accelerated hearing of substantial cases. At present, there are cases of 10 to 20 years before the Supreme Court. Some litigants having cases at the apex court have died without justice.\n\n\u201cIf a lawyer appeals to the Supreme Court, you will see him getting one or two-year timeline. A lot of political and election cases are distracting the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nOn the decentralization of the police, a principal officer said: \u201cIt is a key part of the constitution review which we will debate and approve after the recess.\u201d\n\nDevolution of police\n\nThe Constitution Review Committee has recommended decentralisation of the police operation and bring the police nearer to the people.\n\nIn the new arrangement, there will be additional 17 Zonal Commands, Zonal Police Council, State Security Advisory Council and Community Policing Advisory Council.\n\nThe Zonal Commands shall have operational and budgetary control over the police formations in the zones.\n\nThe Zonal Commands shall prepare and submit to the Force Headquarters their Budget, which the Inspector-General of Police shall forward to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe deployment of an Assistant Inspector-General of Police to a Zone and or his removal from a Zone shall be subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police is stripped of powers to remove an Assistant Inspector-General of Police at will.\n\nThe removal of an Inspector-General of Police and an Assistant Inspector-General of Police shall be based on two-thirds majority of the Senate.\n\nWhile the removal of an Inspector-General of Police and an Assistant-Inspector-General of Police shall be based on two-thirds majority of the Senate, no Commissioner of Police can be removed in a state, except it is subject to approval by two-thirds majority of the House of Assembly of the state.\n\nPolice funding\n\nAlso, the funding of the police will now be at zonal, state and local levels.\n\nSpecial levies and or taxes are to be introduced in the states in the Zones for the purpose of the Fund.\n\nSome of the amendments to the 1999 Constitution are as follows: \u201c Section 215(1)(a) an Inspector-General of Police who, subject to section 216(2) of this constitution shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the National Police Council from among serving members of the Nigerian Police subject to the confirmation of such appointment by the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201c215(1) (b) a Commissioner of Police for each State of the Federation who shall be appointed by the Police Service Commission and deployed by the Inspector-General of Police.\n\n\u201c215(1}(c) A commissioner of Police for a State shall serve in that capacity for a minimum term of two years which may be renewed or extended for another period of two years and no more.\u201d\n\nNew police structure\n\nOn the Zonal Structure of the Nigerian Police Force, Section 215{1)(d) | The Zonal Commands of the Nigerian Police Force shall consist as follows:\n\nThe breakdown of the Zonal Commands of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is as follows: Zone 1 (Kano/Jigawa); Zone 2-(Lagos/ Ogun); Zone 3-(Adamawa/Taraba); Zone 4-(Benue/Nasarawa/ Plateau); Zone 5-(Edo/Delta); Zone 6-(Akwa Ibom/Cross River); Zone 7-(FCT/Niger); Zone 8-(Kogi/Kwara); and Zone 9-(Abia/Ebonyi/Imo).\n\nOthers are Zone 10-(Sokoto/Kebbi/Zamfara); Zone 11-(Osun/Oyo); Zone 12-(Bauchi/Gombe); Zone 13-(Anambra/Enugu); Zone 14-(Katsina/Kaduna); Zone 15-(Borno/Yobe); Zone 16-(Bayelsa/Rivers) and Zone 17-(Ondo/Ekiti).\n\nThe mode of operation of the Zonal Commands is as follows:\n\n\u201cEach Zonal Command shall be headed by an Assistant Inspector-General of Police who shall report to the inspector General of Police.\n\n\u201cThe Zonal Command shall be headed by an Assistant Inspector-General of Police of Police who shall be deployed by the Inspector General-of Police on the recommendation of the Zonal Police Council who shall forward at least six names for the consideration of the Inspector-General of Police from among serving members of the Nigerian Police.\n\nThe deployment of an Assistant Inspector-General of Police to a Zone and or his removal from a Zone shall be subject to confirmation by the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe Zonal Commands shall have operational and budgetary control over the Police formations in the Zones and shall prepare and submit to the Force Headquarters their Budget which the Inspector-General of Police shall forward to the National Assembly for approval.\u201d\n\nThere was also an alteration to Section216 of the 1999 Constitution on the removal of Inspector-General of Police and an Assistant inspector-General of Police.\n\nThe removal of an Inspector-General of Police and an Assistant Inspector-General of Police shall be based on two-thirds majority of the Senate. .\n\nSection 216(1) says: \u201cAn Inspector-General of Police shall only be removed by the President upon the recommendation of the National Police Council praying that he be so removed on any of the following grounds\n\n(a) misconduct in the discharge of his official duties;\n\n(b) breach of Police Act, Regulation and Code and Code of Conduct;\n\n(c) conviction of any offence by court of law or tribunal, including administrative tribunals set up by the Police Authorities for internal discipline of police officers;\n\n(d) indictment by a judicial body or tribunal for corruption, fraud, embezzlement or other unacceptable conducts In office:\n\n(e}) bankruptcy\n\n(f) mental Incapacity;

Police (ADVISORY) Council\u201d\n\nThe document adds: \u201cSection 27(2) The Zonal Police (Advisory) Council shall comprise the following members\n\n(a) Governors in the Zone (to preside as Chairman in rotation);\n\n(b)} Assistant inspectors-General of Police in the Zones;\n\n(c) Attorneys-General and Commissioner for Justice of States in the Zones;\n\n{c) Commissioners of Police in the Zones;\n\n(ad) Chairmen of Traditional Councils of States i the Zones;\n\n(e) 3 Representatives Religious Organizations from the Zones;\n\n(f) Representatives of Civil Societies from the Zones;\n\n\u201cBy inserting a new Section \u201c28(2)\u201d, the functions of the Zonal Police (Advisory?)

It should be spontaneous. We would not play to the gallery. We are already down and they want to add to the problem. Nobody is going to run out of the country. We are all going to be here to see the consequences of what they are planning,\u201d he said.\n\nLawal said labour does not believe in the government\u2019s planned palliative of N5,000 to 40 million Nigerians to cushion the effect of the planned increase in price of petrol.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThey are not going to give anybody anything. I can say it with every sense of responsibility. The last one they did, they set up a palliative committee in which I was a member. Initially, what they told us was that there was N600 billion palliatives fund in the kitty which we are going to appropriate to different sectors of the economy to cushion the effect of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur own memo, that is TUC, was about 50 something pages, while NLC was higher. The two of us met to harmonise it. After our second meeting at Bolton Hotel in Abuja, I stopped going for the meeting because I was dumbfounded when the NNPC man said nobody promised anything. Till now, nothing has come out of it. They are just deceiving us with lies. They won\u2019t give anybody any N5,000.\u201d\n\nThe labour leader said measures ought to have been on ground and running for at least one year before the government could come up with this policy, so that the effect would not negatively affact citizens.\n\n\u201cBut here, we don\u2019t have anything like that. You see, it\u2019s a normal thing to subsidise things because it happens globally. But now they have removed almost everything. So at the end of the day almost 70 per cent of the resources of the state that should have gone to all these areas, they now appropriate it to themselves. With that, they have more than enough to share and that is why they are misbehaving and people are suffering.\u201d\n\nNLC at its meetings in Abuja penultimate Friday had scheduled a nationwide protest for January 27 and February 1, but with a clause that it would not wait till then should the announcement on fuel price hike come before the scheduled dates.\n\nThe NLC charged the government to promote local capacity to refine petroleum products for domestic use.",

          "title": "22 Nigerian Movers and Shakers in 2022",
          "text": "The new year, which will dawn in a few days, has been widely described as a defining moment for Nigeria. From the critical decisions that must be taken to accelerate economic activities, to the choice of candidates, particularly the presidential candidates, by the two leading political parties in coming elections, and the interventions by some private sector leaders, THISDAY, as part of its projections on what 2022 may hold in stock, presents personalities that may have significant impact on the political and business environments, and in turn, shape events in the country.\n\nThe 22 individuals, which have been carefully selected, and what qualify them as those most likely to shape the new year are detailed in this report. In their chosen endeavour, either in business, politics or entertainment, they have shown uncommon dexterity and perseverance in the face of adversity and doubt. The list is by no means exhaustive or definitive, but it represents a guide to a year that holds, in unknown proportions, promise, danger and possibilities that are bound to shape the future of the country one way or another.\n\nBuhari: A President Eager to Document His Achievements\n\nIn 2021, a normally reticent President Muhammadu Buhari, came out of his shell and was aggressive in his investment drive. Not even the threat still posed by COVID-19 could slow him down. This is expected to continue in 2022, as the president appears eager to document his achievements. Buhari is definitely among those that would shape events in the country in 2022. All eyes would be on him to see how he would deal with thorny issues in his final days, such as fuel subsidy removal, which is expected next year.\n\nIn the area of politics, Nigerians would also be watching to see the role Buhari would play in the choice of his successor. His body language towards the APC convention and other issues ahead of the next presidential election is closely watched. His support would be a critical factor in determining the direction of the party and the shape of the next general election. But with nothing really at stake for the president who is completing his second and final term, it remains to be seen if he would strongly back any aspirant.\n\nIn addition, Nigerians would be eager to see how the president would respond to the rising security challenges confronting the country.\n\nOsinbajo: No More Hiding Place\n\nWith the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, he is definitely going to be on the political radar next year. Osinbajo, even though he has not expressed interest in running for political office in 2023, comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but is more likely to keep his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much.\n\nHowever, in 2022, there will no longer be a hiding place for Osinbajo. All along it has been tales of people calling on him to run, even though there are allegations that his associates are the ones funding the various groups springing up to sell his candidature. Today, Osinbajo attends every ceremony \u2013 from birthdays and funerals, to wedding and chieftaincy coronations, among others \u2013 apparently to reinforce himself in the consciousness of Nigerians.\n\nIndeed, there have been different groups urging him to throw his hat in the ring. One of such groups is the Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO), which visited a former military Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, recently. IBB, at the meeting, said Nigeria needed a leader like the vice president to run the country at this time. Babangida said Osinbajo was someone he respected because of his good intentions for the country.\n\nIn 2022, it would be interesting to watch Osinbajo go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to actualise a quietly nursed ambition.\n\nTinubu: To Finally Make His Position Known\n\nAfter playing a kind of hide and seek with the Nigerian public about his presidential ambition, there\u2019s a high possibility that in 2022, Bola Ahmed Tinubu may formally declare his position, whether or not he is gunning for the plum job. The former Lagos State governor is presently consulting with different interest groups and individuals ahead of the 2023 elections, with his eyes allegedly on the exalted seat. With SWAGA, the acronym for \u201cSouth-West Agenda for Asiwaju,\u201d a group populated by Tinubu\u2019s acolytes and yes men, touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature, it is expected that more of such groups would spring up in 2022 as Tinubu is said to continue to strategise ahead of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primaries. At the moment, he appears to be the front runner for the party\u2019s ticket in terms of preparation and war chest. And he is not lacking in supporters who are ready to sing his praises. But in equal measure, he is disliked by many for his vast e, unexplained wealth and his politics of godfatherism.\n\nEmefiele: Still Propagating His Made-in-Nigeria Dream\n\nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele, was, no doubt, one of the key personalities that shaped activities in the Nigerian economy this year. The stewardship of the advocate of domestic production at the apex bank is marked by unprecedented interventions in critical sectors of the economy with potential for high job creation. Efforts by the CBN governor to enhance credit flow to the private sector is particularly noteworthy, especially, in agriculture, through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), which has revolutionised local rice production and created massive job opportunities for Nigerians. The CBN intervention in the power sector has also helped to stabilise the sector, which had almost been crippled by its legacy debts to the financial industry.\n\nEmefiele helped to broker a deal, which had since kept the ship sailing, despite all odds, and guaranteed improved electricity supply to homes and businesses. The apex bank under Emefiele played a crucial role in ensuring that the economy exited two consecutive recessions through its intervention programmes in key sectors as well as boosting government\u2019s spending to reflate the economy. In addition, this year, the central bank under Emefiele launched a Central Bank Digital Currency, the first in Africa, and the \u2018100 to 100\u2019 policy that focuses on job creation.\n\nGoing into 2022, the Emefiele-led CBN, in collaboration with the fiscal authority, would be critical in steering the economy towards accelerated growth.\n\nAtiku: A Recurring Political Decimal\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023 and this would likely be made fully open in 2022. Atiku\u2019s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023, even though he, too, is rumoured to have an ambition in 2023. Some people call him the serial presidential aspirant, but Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.\n\nSince his entry into politics in 1993, Atiku has unsuccessfully contested five times for the Office of President of Nigeria in the following order: 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. Will he be sixth time lucky if he gets the PDP presidential nomination? Will the forces in the PDP support and allow him to contest the primary? All these will unfold in 2022. No doubt, Atiku has enough experience and some see him as the most suited to wrest power from APC. Above all, he is a good tactician.\n\nWigwe: Access Bank\u2019s Aggressive Expansion Continues\n\nGroup Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Hebert Wigwe, who this year was involved in an aggressive expansion drive, is not likely to slow down in 2022. The bank is targeting expanding its footprints to 20 countries in Africa. From Nigeria to Rwanda, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Zambia, among several others, Wigwe\u2019s expansion drive has remained on the rise. A few days ago, the bank opened a new branch in Rivers State, in its bid to serve more customers in the country. In Africa, Access Bank under Wigwe\u2019s leadership is positioning itself to tap from the opportunities in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nFrom a small bank in 2002, Wigwe, who took over from his close friend and business partner, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, in 2014, has completely transformed the bank, which then was ranked 65th among 89 banks operating in the country.\n\nDangote: Ready to Rescue Nigeria from Fuel Importation\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest man and President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, is among those expected to shape events next year. While products from his $2 billion granulated urea fertiliser plant hit the market this year, in 2022, his first private crude oil refinery is expected to commence operations in Nigeria. This refinery, expected to be a game changer for the country in 2022, would to be a major forex saver for the country. The Dangote Refinery is under construction in the outskirts of Lagos State, and when fully operational, the $7 billion investment would have the capacity to process about 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day, making it the largest single-train refinery in the world. The refinery would significantly impact on the Nigerian economy, and it expected to end importation of refined petroleum products.\n\nOtedola: A Critical Factor in First Bank\u2019s Future\n\nBillionaire businessman and philanthropist, Femi Otedola, became one of the personalities that shaped 2021, through his strategic investment in FBN Holdings. Presently, the billionaire is the single largest shareholder in the holding company with a total shareholding of 7.5 per cent and he is going to play a role in determining the future of First Bank, the leading subsidiary of FBN Holdings and an important bank in Nigeria.\n\nMarket analysts believe Otedola must have pumped a whopping N45 billion to attain the dominant position. But the Chairman of Geregu Energy Group has since debunked speculations that he is interested in holding a board position in FBN Holdings, First Bank or any of their subsidiaries.\n\nThis year, Otedola was also invited by the UK-based Save the Children to join the prestigious group of its Vice Presidents, in recognition of his philanthropic efforts to better the lives of thechildren in Nigeria. Save the Children is the second largest charity in the world, after UNICEF, and has Princess Anne as Patron since 2017, after serving as President since 1970.\n\nSaraki: Not Giving Up on North Central\u2019s Claim\n\nA former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, strongly believes the North-central geopolitical zone has paid its due by working very hard to keep Nigeria together as one united entity and should be given the chance to lead the country. He also thinks he is the perfect man to lead Nigeria, when the tenure of the present All Progressives Congress (APC) government ends. The former Kwara State governor has announced his intention to run for the office of the president in 2023. Going by his disposition, Saraki is not going to back down as he seeks the support of people of his region and other PDP leaders towards realising his presidential ambition. He is widely considered qualified, competent and boasting the requisite capacity for the job..\n\nElumelu: Relentlessly Supporting African Entrepreneurs\n\nFounder, Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Mr. Tony Elumelu, is expected to remain focused on building the next generation of entrepreneurs in Africa, which he says is his lifetime ambition. His goal is to impact lives and transform societies in Africa. Through his TEF Entrepreneurship Programme, a $100 million commitment to empower 10,000 African entrepreneurs, he intends to the continent better than he met them. Elumelu is driven by his philosophy of Africapitalism, through which he wants to see the private sector play its role in the economic development of the continent. In 2022, he is expected to continue to promote the development of young African entrepreneurs.\n\nAyu: A Leadership on Trial\n\nThe leadership skills of the new National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyiorcha Ayu, would be tested in 2022. How Ayu would be able to manage the different tendencies in the party and keep them together would determine if his name would be in the PDP hall of fame or infamy. He has started well by identifying APC\u2019s alleged failures and promising to rescue Nigeria from the ruling party. He has continued to remind Nigerians what he terms the good days under the PDP government and also how the APC has allegedly destroyed the country. Ayu has also cited the rising security challenge as one of the reasons the APC should not be allowed to lead the country beyond 2023. He has given himself a target of winning about 25 states in 2023, which sounds like a tall ambition. But the main task for him next year would be to manage the big egos in PDP, especially, some of the governors.\n\nAhmed: Driving the Nation\u2019s Economic Direction\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, will play a critical role in shaping the direction of the Nigerian economy in 2022. Nigeria recently launched a five-year National Development Plan (NDP), a replacement to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which expired in December 2020. The country requires an investment size of N348.1 trillion to achieve the targets set out in the NDP from 2021 to 2025. The projected investment portfolio would be contributed by the government, which would source 14.3 per cent (N49.7 trillion) of the amount, while the balance of 85.7 per cent (N298.3 trillion) would come from the private sector.\n\nThe overall target of the plan is to achieve a broad-based real GDP growth rate of five per cent on the average during the period; generate 21 million full-time jobs; and through an inclusive growth, lift 35 million people out of poverty. The finance minister will be expected to drive the process of actualising some of the set goals in the plan before the end of the present administration.\n\nBuni: Live or Die\u2026APC in His Hands\n\nNational Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Committee of APC under the leadership of Hon. Mai Mala Buni, who is also the governor of Yobe State, must conduct the national convention for party as soon as possible. Presently, there are several power blocs in APC reportedly battling for the soul of the party ahead of the February 18, 2023 presidential election. Some aggrieved party leaders, believed to have an axe to grind with Buni, have been pushing for the convention to take place. Of course, the outcome of the national convention, which has been tentatively fixed for February next year, will determine the fate of the party. What this means, therefore, is that the fate of the ruling party is in the hands of Buni.\n\nDavido: Taking Philanthropy to Another Level\n\nDavid Adeleke, whose stage name is Davido, made news towards the end of 2021 following his N250 million donation to orphanages across the country during his birthday celebration. The award-winning singer has since set up a five-man committee to supervise the disbursement of the fund. Nigerians would be expecting to see how the committee would distribute the money. In addition, Nigerians would be looking forward to more releases by the award-winning musician in the new year.\n\nFayemi: Eyes on the Ball\n\nMany believe the Ekiti State governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, also has his eyes on the presidency. But he is said to be keeping his cards close to his chest because of the forthcoming governorship election in his state, which holds in June next year. For Fayemi, who would be completing his second term in the new year, the first battle next year would be to ensure that his party wins the governorship election. He has his eyes on the ball; yet, all eyes are on him.\n\nWike: One-man Political Squad\n\nArguably the most influential governor in the country today, by the time 2022 would be winding down, the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, will just be months away from completing an eventful eight-year tenure. Wike has largely determined the direction the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been going since it lost the general election of 2015. He saw to the exit of erstwhile National Chairman, Uche Secondus, earlier in the year.\n\nIn 2022, it is not likely PDP will want to take any step without Wike\u2019s input. He is one of those to watch in the new year. Even his opponents cannot deny that.\n\nWizkid: A Consistently Rising Star\n\nRecently, while performing during a live show, a fan grabbed the legs of Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid, and it took the intervention of security guards around the stage to rescue him. This young musician remains one of the most influential entertainment icons on the continent in 2021, and 2022 won\u2019t be different.\n\nThis year, he made history when he edged out Drake to win Mobo Awards. He also made history as the most awarded African act after winning the Best International Act and Best African Act awards. His \u201cEssence\u201d, which featured Justin Bieber and Tems, crossed genre lines to top Billboard\u2019s R&B, hip-hop, rhythmic and world charts. Coming up on the one-year anniversary of its release, it reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and became the first song with lyrics in Nigeria\u2019s Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 language to debut on the Global 200 chart, with 269 million on-demand global streams, according to MRC Data,\n\nIn 2019, producer P2J, a frequent collaborator of both Wizkid and Beyonc\u00e9, recruited the Nigerian superstar for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cBrown Skin Girl\u201d (also featuring young Blue Ivy Carter and SAINt JHN) from The Lion King: The Gift. Both songs yielded Grammy attention for Wizkid: a nomination for album of the year as part of Drake\u2019s Views and a win for best music video for the latter.\n\nThe year 2022 is not expected to be different for Wizkid.\n\nBurna Boy: Mummy\u2019s Boy, Music\u2019s Gem\n\nWith his mother as his indisputable role model, 2021 has been good to Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, commonly known as Burna Boy. He made remarkable progress as a musician this year and, no doubt, he lived up to his title of African Giant. He won the Best International Act Award this year and also his album, Twice as Tall, won a Grammy, the Best Global Music Album in 2021.\n\nHe is a Nigerian singer, rapper and songwriter. He is one of the biggest and most successful African artists. Burna Boy became the first African artiste to bag three nominations consecutively, having won the BET Award in 2019, 2020 and now in 2021.\n\nThe year 2022 will surely see the award-winning artist maintain his rising profile.\n\nTambuwal: Never Say Die\n\nOrdinarily, the security challenges faced by Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum should be enough to make his name fizzle out from the list of those to watch out for in 2022. But that won\u2019t be the case. Within his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he remains one of the most influential members and it is not a coincidence that his name keeps propping up as the likely presidential candidate of the PDP in 2023 should the party zone it to the North.\n\nA former Speaker of the House of Representatives, security challenges or not, he remains one of those to watch out for in 2022.\n\nMele Kyari: Leading the Transformation of the Oil and Gas\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, who is moving the corporation on a trajectory of achieving global excellence is one of those that would define the direction for Nigeria\u2019s economy in 2022. With the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which has been described as a game-changer for the industry, the NNPC would be expected to drive the process of transforming the nation\u2019s petroleum industry into a hub of business opportunities. The Act is also expected to attract huge capital globally into the country\u2019s oil sector, strengthen cost recovery and ensure decent returns on investment.\n\nIt is also expected that Kyari, who has been in the forefront of transforming the oil and gas industry would ride on the new legislation to promote good governance in the oil and gas sector in tandem with the international best practices. However, one thorny issue that he would be confronted with this year is how he would manage issues around the proposed fuel subsidy removal. He has shown his clear disdain for its retention and preached repeatedly that subsidy is not benefiting the poor, which he insists, negates the purpose. In 2022 when the subsidy on petrol is expected to be removed, his negotiating skills will be tested like never before for the simple reason that Labour is recalcitrant about its opposition to subsidy removal\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji: The Power of Tech and Innovation\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji co-founded two successful fintech startups in Africa before launching Flutterwave in 2017. With $15.7 million in funding, the payments company is empowering Pan-African merchants to execute business on global scale, processing $1.2 billion in transactions so far. Aboyeji\u2019s previous startup Andela, gained attention when the venture received $24 million in funding from Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn 2021, Flutterwave started the year by securing a $170 million deal in the first quarter. New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global led the Series C round. New and existing investors who participated include DST Global, Early Capital Berrywood, Green Visor Capital, Greycroft Capital, Insight Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Tiger Management, Worldpay FIS and 9yards Capital. The Series C round came a year after Flutterwave had closed its $35 million Series B and $20 million Series A in 2018. The company helps businesses build customisable payments applications through its APIs.\n\nShola Akinlade: Expanding the Frontiers Beyond Africa\n\nAkinlade is the Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Paystack, a fintech company. The company provides modern online and offline payments services for users across the continent. It was founded in 2015 and was acquired by Stripe in 2020 for over $200 million in what was then described as one of the biggest exits in the African tech space. Paystack currently services more than 60,000 businesses and millions of individuals scored 27.5 for ingenious storytelling, 28.5 for brand tribe and 31 for brand experience thus ranking it at Number 8 with a total of 87 points. But despite the acquisition, Paystack has continued to operate independently. Stripe had estimated that the African internet economy was expanding quickly, with online commerce in the region growing at 21 per cent year-over-year, which was said to be 75 per cent faster than the global average. Akinlade believes that with the right tools, African creators, developers, and entrepreneurs would be able to do incredible things.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2018Our courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land. Let us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a special Christmas message personally signed and issued yesterday, promised to ensure that the security challenges facing Nigerians become history soon.\n\nFor years, terrorists have been roaming across the country unhindered, killing, kidnapping and maiming.\n\nWhile rejoicing with Nigerian Christians as they celebrate Christmas, the President declared: \u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\u201d\n\nThe President admitted that despite the \u201cremarkable successes generally recorded,\u201d the nation still has challenges to contend with.\n\nHe noted that the military was doing everything possible to tackle the insecurity menace.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time. It is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\u201d\n\nThe President urged Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in them and see the present order of things as a phase that would also pass, \u201cjust like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe said his government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, adding that the diversification of the economy embarked upon by his government was yielding fruits.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWe shall continue to create opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy. As we felicitate with family, friends, colleagues, associates, let us spare moments to reach out to the less privileged.\n\n\u201cLet us also pray and give words of encouragement to our gallant security personnel fulfilling their oaths to keep us safe.\n\n\u201cI assure my compatriots that this administration remains resolute at ensuring that the standard of living of the average Nigerian is elevated.\u201d\n\nHe assured that his six and half-year administration would fulfill all the promises made to Nigerians before the government terminates in 17 months\u2019 time.\n\nUrges Citizens to Get Vaccinated\n\nAlso in the Christmas message, the President pleaded with all citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that for the second Christmas running, the world would not be able to celebrate as it used to in years past because of the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic, with its attendant debilitating impact, has remained with mankind, mutating and leaving in its wake, devastating consequences on the economy, social interaction, and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining, however, is that humanity has been able to rise up with one voice and purpose, to confront the foisted conditions.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to appeal to our dear citizens to embrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic. Recent events have shown that vaccination greatly reduces the effects of the virus on the human body.\n\n\u201cI will also urge those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC). I commend the efforts of members of the PSC under the headship of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation as they continue to chart a roadmap out of the pandemic and associated issues.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I wish Nigerians Merry Christmas!\u201d\n\nKaigama: Heart of Every Nigerian Heavy with Suffering\n\nThe Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace, Most Revd. Ignatius Kaigama yesterday lamented that the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with the suffering they had experienced and seen in 2021 alone.\n\nKaigama, who stated this in his Christmas message, also called on Nigerians not to give up on the country, saying although the present situations may be tough, \u201cGod is in control.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with security challenges, COVID-19 and agitations for self-determination, Nigerians would not forget 2021 in a hurry.\n\nThe cleric told the faithful not to give up on their country, but \u201cdare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKaigama said: \u201cChristmas this year has found us in the throes of woes and distressing circumstances far beyond our human control. As Nigerians, in almost every part of this country, our hearts are heavy with the suffering we have experienced and seen this year alone \u2013 the many deaths as a result of terrorism, kidnapping and banditry, the depressing economic situation with inflation spiraling out of control, crashing further the ordinary man who has already been drained of joy, peace, and hope.\n\n\u201cThe violent agitations for self-determination, which have come with the loss of lives and limbs, have left horrific scars on our collective psyche. All these make this year one that many Nigerians may not forget in a hurry. Nevertheless, Christmas proclaims, \u2018Joy to the world the Lord has come.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor every disenchanted Nigerian who is on the verge of giving up on this country; for anyone who is prepared to cut off his moorings and drifts away to distant lands, Christmas challenges us to dare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that unbridled corruption and criminality were a grim reminder that selfishness had taken root in the hearts of many statesmen, the Archbishop said: \u201cChristmas is an invitation to give up selfishness, to think only of others and how to bring the greatest happiness to them.\n\n\u201cOn account of Christmas, all our leaders are challenged to once again dream big for our country and to faithfully work hard to realise those dreams so as to find solutions to our teething problems and better the lives of some of the poorest people on earth.\u201d\n\nCatholic Bishops Urge Nigerians to Be Hopeful\n\nCatholic Bishops have urged Nigerians overwhelmed by suffering and hardship not to give up hope of a better Nigeria.\n\nThe bishops said Nigerians should always remember the popular Christmas refrain, Emmanuel which is that \u201cGod is with us\u201d and try to be hopeful of a better future.\n\nIn its Christmas message issued by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) jointly signed by the President, Most Rev. Augustine Akubeze; Vice President, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji and Secretary, Most Rev. Camillus Umoh, the clergymen enjoined Nigerians not to allow any situation to lead them to despair because God is always there to intervene for them.\n\n\u201cThis feast reminds us that God is with us. Therefore, the word \u2018Emmanuel\u2019 should be a constant refrain in our mouths. We should, therefore, not allow any situation to lead us to despair because God is always with us.

          "text": "*Ganduje demands deployment of more soldiers in Kano\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has described the multiple rocket attacks in Maiduguri by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) ahead of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno State last Thursday as worrisome.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba stated this while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa.\n\nThis is just as the federal government allayed the fears of Nigerians over the reported planned attack by terrorists on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nISWAP had launched multiple rockets on Maiduguri, the state capital, hours before the visit of the President to Borno State.\n\nFive people were killed and many houses destroyed by the ISWAP rockets that landed in different areas, including Ngomari, Bulumkutu, Ajilari, and Ayafe communities.\n\nThe IG, however, said the insurgents were unable to achieve their objectives.\n\n\u201cThey are launching it in major towns, they are launching it in Maiduguri. It is a concern. And it has been seriously checkmated. There are efforts to continuously checkmate it,\u201d Baba said.\n\nHe stressed that although the government and the security forces were particularly concerned about the rocket attacks, the target of the terrorists was defeated by security forces.\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari, during the meeting, tasked all security and intelligence chiefs in attendance to increase the heat against the terrorists and all other criminals, saying none should be spared.\n\nThe IG said they were asked to spare no terrorist or criminal, adding that the target now should be crime prevention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe marching orders are always the same; you have even told Nigerians the marching orders of the President. It has always been the same; there is no space, there is no tolerance to any threat to security.\n\n\u201cThere is no sparing of any terrorist and there must be an intelligence gathering, there must be proactive prevention of crime and there must be checkmating of all those that are involved in criminal activities, whether it is terrorism, banditry or armed robbery or whatever and that is what we are trying to do to the best of our knowledge and ability.\u201d\n\nOn why there are so many policemen deployed to the South-east region of the country, seemingly more than to areas considered more prone to violent crimes, Usman said population, economic activities and other factors determine deployment.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou said it is an allegation which has not been proven, it has always been an allegation. The spaces are different, the whole of the South-east, in terms of landmass, might not be as large as Niger State, so certainly you may see a number of policemen within a very small space, trying to do policing work and you may see another number, not equal, doing much more than that.\n\n\u201cBut when we talk about policing a population or policing a place where there is economic activity or policing in a place where there are more threats, then certainly you have to put more men to govern that small space and that is what you are seeing.\n\nAlso speaking to newsmen, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allayed fears among Nigerians, especially the residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, over reported planned attack on Abuja, saying there is no cause for worry.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any threat to the safety and security of Abuja. Abuja is secure and very safe. If there was a leak, as you mentioned, it could just be an operational alert that does not require any worry or concern. The Council has mandated us to assure Nigerians of their safety, of their security and enduring peace for the period of the festivities.\n\n\u201cThe message of the Security Council, through you to Nigerians, is that all measures for the safety and security of the Nigerian people and Nigeria, are in place for a successful and happy celebration of the yuletide and the New Year. Compliment of the season to all of us from the President and members of the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBefore the commencement of the security meeting, the President swore-in the newly-appointed Minister of State for Works and Housing, Muazu Sambo.\n\nIn attendance at the security meeting yesterday were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.).\n\nOthers include Minister of Defense, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.); Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; Chief of Defense Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo; and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nAlso present were the Inspector-General; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; and the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nGanduje Demands Deployment of more Soldiers\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more military personnel to forests in the state.\n\nSpeaking to journalists yesterday after meeting with the president in Abuja, Ganduje said he came to brief Buhari on the security situation in his state.\n\nHe called for the establishment of another military training base in the forest bordering Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi and Plateau, as part of efforts to check the activities of criminals.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThere are challenges all over the country that are unfortunate, but we believe Mr. President is doing his best with other stakeholders in order to curtail the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need the helping hand of almost everybody, especially governors and chairmen of local governments. We have observed that the security situation is worsening now. Our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, terrorists, armed robbers and criminals.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, we have taken some measures. We have two large forests, including the Falgore forest, which borders Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the army and there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest, using the facilities that we have provided.\n\n\u201cSo, that is helping to checkmate the activities of bandits in that forest and I have requested Mr. President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\u201d\n\nHe added that the state introduced the use of technology within its forests to improve effective communication between security operatives in the state.\n\nAccording to Ganduje, the state has also constituted an enlarged security committee to promote efforts to maintain peace.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have introduced technology within the forest. From the office of the DSS in Kano and the office of the commissioner of police and even from my office, we are able to monitor what is happening in that forest.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s effective communication between the DSS and the police and those who are managing the forest \u2014 the checkpoints and various places that security agencies are manning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re laying over 100 kilometres of optic fibre within the Kano metropolis, so that CCTV cameras will be more effective and we can manage the whole mega city in terms of security and also in terms of network improvement.\n\n\u201cWe have also constituted what we call an enlarged security committee because limiting it to the air force, army, police, DSS, civil defence, I think the security network, in terms of flow of information, requires much more than that.\n\n\u201cAlso, we introduced technology. As earlier mentioned, we have the most powerful tracker in the country. Through that one, even some people who escaped to Niger Republic, Cameroon, we were able to trace them and connect with international security agencies for their arrest.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

When we got to Ajah, around Mega Chicken, we were stopped by some team of four guys and 2 policemen in uniform. They just double-crossed us all of a sudden.

I told them to let me call my family that I have been kidnapped but the next thing I heard was that I should behave myself and shouldn\u2019t call anybody,\u201d one of them told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThey told the driver to keep driving until he saw a free space where he could park, so after the driver parked. They brought us out of the car and they said: who are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? So the next thing, they collected our identity cards, our phones.

          "text": "The tenacious under-recovery of premium motor spirit (PMS), also known as petrol subsidy, created a messy revenue for the federation in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the usual controversies about whether \u201cto remove or not,\u201d the petrol subsidy payments gulped over N1.03 trillion in 10 months, resulting in low revenue for federal, state and local governments to cater for developmental projects.\n\nThis figure is more than the budget proposal for Nigeria\u2019s health sector in 2022 at N711.2 billion.\n\nIn April and October 2021, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recorded no revenue from oil export due to overbearing subsidy claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheCable looks at how payment of petrol subsidy affected the country\u2019s revenue in 2021.\n\nHIGHER OIL PRICES, LOW IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY\n\nOil prices performed better in 2021 \u2014 reaching a three-year high. Last year, prices bottomed out due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, which roiled the global oil market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom $11 per barrel in 2020 to above $80/barrel in 2021, the rise in global crude oil prices should portend an upturn in Nigeria\u2019s economy as it implies more oil revenues for the government.\n\nBut that has not been the case with subsidy claims eroding the gains from oil revenue.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari presides over a federal executive meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout 2021, the federal government made up for the shortfall to ensure that citizens bought the commodity below the actual value. Since there was no provision for subsidy payment in the 2021 budget, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) resolved to directly it from the revenue remittance to the federation account allocation committee (FAAC).\n\nThis is partly due to the absence of functional and optimal refineries, which forced the country to spend part of its revenue subsidising refined products for citizens.\n\nIn simple terms, a higher oil price comes with a climb in petrol\u2019s landing cost \u2014 meaning an increase in global oil price means the government will continue to pay more to subsidise the product for local consumers \u2014 contestable citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMele Kyari, NNPC GMDDWINDLED REVENUE ALLOCATION\n\nDespite projecting N2.09 trillion revenue remittance to FAAC between January and October 2021, the state-owned oil firm only remitted a meagre of N511.66 billion during the period, resulting in a N1.58 trillion shortfall.\n\nOwing to the revenue shortfall, FAAC had to forgo a huge chunk of revenue from the oil sector \u2014 an integral revenue source for an oil-dependent nation.\n\nIn April, the corporation said it did not remit any amount from oil and gas proceeds to FAAC in May due to the pressure of funding petrol subsidy, thereby reducing revenue distribution to the three tiers of government in the month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the same month, Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo state, accused the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) of printing N60 billion to boost the March allocation.\n\nThe federal government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) dismissed Obaseki\u2019s claim.\n\nIn October, President Muhammadu Buhari said that the federal government\u2019s expenses on subsidy affected the revenue that should have been used to fund the 2021 budget.\n\nBut what should Nigerians expect in 2022?\n\nIn a new move, the federal government is planning to replace petrol subsidy with N5000 for the poorest Nigerians.",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lighting address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lighting developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "West African e-commerce platforms take local fashion makers global",
          "text": "\u201cI\u2019ve always loved and wanted to wear African prints more here,\u201d says Bami Adenike, expressing her enduring fondness for African wear despite staying close to alluring luxury boutiques in Paris. Adenike, a 28-year-old Nigerian artist, moved to France in 2016 and has mostly bought clothes from French fashion retail stores since relocating due to the prohibitive costs of having custom-made African dresses shipped to Europe.\n\nBy late 2020, when Adenike wanted to update her closet, she discovered a number of online platforms offering to deliver African apparel to Europe, at affordable rates, and took a chance ordering through Fashtracker, a marketplace that connects more than 40 African designers with local and international consumers. Within two weeks, her prints were delivered to her door in Paris by DHL.\n\n\u201cI have to admit I was shocked the dresses were well fitted. I used to spend hours looking through Ankara images on Pinterest without any idea how to get them,\u201d she told TechCabal on a phone call. \u201cNow, it\u2019s become a norm for me to patronise brands from Nigeria and sometimes other West African countries.\u201d\n\nAfrican fashion has in recent times attracted significant media interest from the Global North, partly fueled by megastars\u2014such as Naomi Campbell, Alicia Keys, and Beyonc\u00e9\u2014who occasionally rock clothes designed on the continent. Last year, the latter, a 28-time Grammy award winner, was spotted wearing a patterned dress and wide-leg pants made by Tongoro, a Senegalese brand owned by designer Sarah Diouf.\n\nWhile entertainment celebrities have had a hand in propelling African designers to international fame, Africans in the diaspora like Adenike are the biggest consumers of clothes exported from the continent, with e-commerce platforms\u2014such as Nigeria-based Fashtracker and Ivorian site Afrikrea\u2014playing middlemen.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe African Union Commission defines the African Diaspora as \u201cpeoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union\u201d. Globally, this group is spread out across several continents. An estimated 36 million Africans live outside the country of their birth, with just over 50% resident within the continent. The sheer size of the African Diaspora means there\u2019s a large potential market for African fashion collections outside the continent.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal for this article, Fashtracker founder and CEO Wunmi Akinsola revealed the platform was originally built to serve markets in Africa. But that changed when the team realised more traction was coming from outside the continent than within. \u201cI was only running ads for Nigeria and neighbouring countries, and yet about half of my customers came from other parts of the world. So, it became obvious that there\u2019s a massive market out there,\u201d Akinsola said.\n\nMoulaye Tabour\u00e9, the founder of Afrikrea, grew up in Mali but has lived and worked in several countries. While in Paris, he discovered that the Africans he came across abroad were mostly interested in African fashion items but could not readily access them. That inspired the founding of his online marketplace in 2016 with the ambition to export African culture globally.\n\n\u201cA few months after we launched and had some designers, our close ones noticed we were wearing more African products and got more interested,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cAfrikrea led us to consume more from African businesses, not by solidarity or charity, but out of pure interest.\u201d\n\nThis year, Afrikrea\u2019s community of merchants has carried out almost \u20ac8 million worth of transactions, according to the company\u2019s data, with over 80% of its orders coming from outside the continent\u201440% from Europe and 30% from the US. It claims to record more than 500,000 site visits monthly.\n\nDespite facing stiff competition from several other similar platforms, Tabour\u00e9 believes product diversity has helped Afrikrea grow rapidly, considering the African Diaspora isn\u2019t a monolithic group. \u201cThe black diaspora is the largest in the world and also probably the most heterogeneous. So having a wide array of sellers, products, and experiences to cater to everyone has always been key to our success,\u201d he said.\n\nAfrikrea and its counterparts are increasingly attracting African designers and micro-businesses along the fashion and art value chains that wish to gain awareness among customers outside the continent. Within five years, Afrikrea grew its seller base from 500 to 10,000 across 47 African countries and currently allows them to showcase and sell African-inspired clothing and accessories to 170 countries around the world.\n\nEssentially, these platforms provide a gateway to reach global consumers demanding African fashion collections and handle all the resource-intensive components, including marketing, cross-border shipping, and payments, which would otherwise hinder local fashion designers and dealers from selling outside their national borders.\n\n\u201cAfter launching on Instagram and boosting our post, we started getting a lot of inquiries from people abroad about purchasing items. But there was no way to get things to them effectively,\u201d says John Pelumi Oyedokun, founder and creative director of Mode Vert Limited, a Nigerian company behind fashion label Jon Pelumi, which launched in 2019. Oyedokun then partnered with Fashtracker after Akinsola reached out to him. \u201cAfter signing up [on Fashtracker], we\u2019re able to sell our products to a growing customer base in Ghana, the US, and Canada.\u201d\n\nFor Olakunmi Oni, Lagos-based fashion designer and the founder of minimalist women\u2019s clothing line, 1964 Brand, selling online and shipping abroad was never a problem but admits that listing her brand products on Fashtracker \u201cshows our designs to a much wider audience.\u201d\n\nTypically, designers selling on e-commerce sites can create storefronts and receive payments from anywhere in the world. Once a purchase is made, the platform deducts a commission of 10-15% per sale. For the logistics side of things, Afrikrea, for instance, has a partnership with DHL that allows micro-retailers selling via its platform to ship to their customers for as low as $20 per package. The company also recently launched ANKA, a SaaS e-commerce solution for African fashion designers and merchants, offering a single dashboard to manage multiple sales channels, inventory, and payments.\n\nAnkara dresses are now popular among Africans and non-Africans in Europe and North America, thanks to e-commerce. Photo credit: Umaizi\n\nWhether curators like Afrikrea or single-brand sites such as Ghana\u2019s KIKI Clothing, platforms for African fashion tap into a growing global demand for African designer goods, riding on e-commerce. Africa\u2019s e-commerce opportunity is estimated to be $19.8 billion by Statista, and in terms of general e-commerce activities on the continent, McKinsey & Company estimates consumer spending to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025.\n\nThat presents an opportunity for local retailers to promote African fashion globally, especially with consumers increasingly switching to online shopping amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic. For designers, partnerships with e-commerce platforms transform their otherwise small tailor businesses into fashion brands with global patronage while opening up the $31 billion sub-Saharan Africa clothing market to the rest of the world.\n\nBut scaling globally isn\u2019t without its own challenges. Custom officers mostly within the continent still pose a major constraint to cross-border shipment, especially in the absence of an effective free trade agreement. \u201cInitiatives like the AfCFTA are there but yet to become concrete realities,\u201d Tabour\u00e9 said. He adds that African governments can do more by facilitating customs for people shipping outside of the continent, particularly to Europe. \u201cWe want to take African culture to you wherever you are. Our job is mainly to remain optimistic but pragmatic.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s lastest loan to fund startups is a product of VP Osibajo Silicon Valley visit",
          "text": "Three years ago, during a roadshow that lasted three days, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osibajo visited San Francisco\u2019s Silicon Valley to meet with the executives of top tech companies, in order to attract investments to Nigeria\u2019s thriving tech space. The VP, with newly inaugurated members of his Advisory Group on Technology and Creativity, met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue before ending the trip at the entertainment centre of the world, Hollywood, where he met with representatives from Sony, Disney, 20th Century, and Imax.\n\nDuring talks in the roadshow, some investors hinted that even though they are willing to invest in Nigeria, they want the government to have some skin in the tech ecosystem game. When they got back from the trip, the office of the Vice President contacted the African Development Bank (AfDB) to support Nigeria with funding.\n\nThe dividends of these efforts did not materialise until this year when the AfDB approved a loan of $170 million to finance the Digital and Creative Enterprises Programme (i-DICE), an initiative by the federal government of Nigeria to promote digital and creative industries in the country. The programme is co-financed by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB)\n\n\u201cGovernments have a much greater role than just policy making. They need to be innovative and create an enabling environment that includes infrastructure and de-risking to harness private sector investments in key growth sectors,\u201d said African Development Bank President Akinwumi A. Adesina, speaking on AfDB\u2019s investment.\n\nThe i-DICE programme is a first-of-its-kind programme that intends to boost innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, enhance social development, boost innovation, and achieve economic transformation by fostering growth in the technology and creative ecosystem. From 2022 to 2026, the programme seeks to attract approximately US$695.80 million to finance various programmatic interventions (US$227.80m) and ground-breaking investment in businesses in the technology and creative sector (US$468m).\n\nThis investment will stimulate 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial benefits to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises. The programme is also expected to help reduce the country\u2019s growing unemployment rate by creating 6.1 million direct and indirect jobs. AfDB\u2019s recent investment alone will support the creation of about 850,000 jobs. It is estimated that the entire added value of the programme to the Nigerian economy would be $6.4 billion.\n\nThe programme will support the digital and creative space across four pillars: human capital, enabling environment, finance, and infrastructure. i-DICE will engage in skill development to equip Nigerians from ages 15 to 34 with technology and creative skills to increase their employability, foster innovation in both ecosystems, and widen the pool of entrepreneurs in the country. One of the ways it aims to do this is by upgrading the physical infrastructure of selected tertiary institutions\u2014universities and polytechnics\u2014to satellite labs and innovation centres of excellence and digital entrepreneurship (ICEDE); and online infrastructure\u2014by upgrading the selected online platform to host digital training content and other modules/features.\n\nIt will also support technology and creative enterprises by organising Hackathons, providing mentorship, launching a startup voucher programme that will support early-stage startups and entrepreneurs with access to workspace and hubs. It will also help these organisations cut cost by providing them with infrastructure like off-grid power solutions.\n\nThrough the Nigeria Entrepreneurship and Innovation Investment Fund, with an initial closing of $468 million, the programme will provide funding for early- and growth-stage businesses in the technology and creative industries in Nigeria. The Fund will invest in these businesses through three funding routes. It will do this by direct investments or debt financing of up to 85% in the Series A rounds of growth-stage startups and about 15-30% in the funding rounds of early-stage startups. Other ways it will also invest in these businesses is by subscribing to closed-end private funds as a Limited Partner of micro-venture capital firms and well-established venture capital firms and investing in listed private equity companies, funds, or other vehicles.\n\nNeed for a government-led fund for startups\n\nThe federal government discovered that while it has gotten relatively easier for Nigerian founders to raise money after series A, those in the early stage trying to raise some money to build an MVP or wanting to test their product and market find it much more difficult to raise money. So, the federal government is coming into the space to support investments in these early-stage startups.\n\nIn the process that led to the creation of this programme, a report Catalysing Growth through Innovation, funded by the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), was published by the federal government to map out the innovation going on in the country.\n\nIfe Adebayo, Special Assistant to the Vice President on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, one of the brains behind the programme, explained that the government is involved in funding startups because it will help the ecosystem engage more confidently with investors, since the government is also actively involved in the ecosystem.\n\nThis is against the backdrop of the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSB), a bill that promises to create an enabling environment for Nigerian startups to thrive by resolving standing issues like the unfavourable regulatory environment, weak infrastructure, and lack of innovation incentives like tax breaks. The bill moved closer to being enacted into law when it was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) just last week. This programme hopes to ensure the localisation of the bill when it is passed into law, across all the states of the country. It will serve as a framework to test how effective the bill will be in the ecosystem.\n\nAnother important reason for the government\u2019s foray into the tech ecosystem is to invest outside the Lagos and Abuja bubble. The programme will be targeting states like Enugu and Kaduna where innovation activities are increasing, and some other parts of the country where it is at beginner level.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Make our burden lighter in 2022, Nigerians beg FG",
          "text": "Burdened as they have been in the outgoing year, Nigerians are begging President Muhammadu Buhari to lighten their burden in the incoming year, 2022.\n\nWhether it is hunger, poverty, unemployment or insecurity, the story is the same. They are the realities that define Nigeria and the life of an average Nigerian. This became worse in 2021\u2014a year Nigerians expected to see succour after the crippling and life-threatening impact of Covid-19 in 2020.\n\nLike the Israelites under their Egyptian task-masters, Nigerians have been compelled to produce something from nothing and, because this is difficult and impossible in most cases, hunger has become a native in the country, ravishing many homes.\n\nIt is no joke that poverty has its headquarters in Nigeria, according to an international rating body. And besides hunger, which is a physical manifestation of poverty, many young Nigerians have been driven into various crimes\u2014armed robbery, banditry, kidnapping, prostitution, among others.\n\nNigerians\u2019 burden emanates from a genealogy that is as clear as it is worrying. Unemployment, the figure of which is frightening in a country so richly endowed, is the grandfather that gave birth to poverty; then hunger and insecurity, which are by-products of a bruised mind and troubled psyche.\n\nAll these are sight and scenes that Nigerians want the government of their country to end with 2021 so that a new lease of life will greet them in 2022.\n\nNo doubt, the current year has been very challenging. It has demanded so much from Nigerians in order to stay afloat the wave of inclement socio-economic and political weather and an intolerable maladministration.\n\nApart from the challenges already mentioned, the country has had to contend with other challenges, including inflation as reflected in rising food and other costs, #TwitterBan, continued police brutality and even COVID-19.\n\nMore recent activities such as President Buhari\u2019s refusal to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill on day 31, when the law requires a response within 30 days, speaks volume about his respect for the rule of law. And there\u2019s no gain saying that any country with leadership lawlessness is not only rudderless but also doomed.\n\nNigerians have experienced and are still experiencing some of the worst times in the history of the country, in the last six years of this present administration.\n\nWith unemployment rate hitting all time high at almost 40 percent, inflation rate currently at 15.99 percent, after hitting a peak of 18.17 percent in March this year, and food prices soaring the highest, millions of Nigerians cannot afford two square meals again.\n\nOf course, the masses\u2019 woe is worsened by the lingering huge impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw many SMEs and entrepreneurs shutting down, and leaving scores unemployed.\n\nAs the economy struggles to recover, economic hardship worsens and the impact of the pandemic still lingering in 2021, concerned Nigerians are calling on the government to make their burdens lighter in 2022.\n\nThe call is against the backdrop of the many planned increases in taxation, total removal of fuel subsidy and expectant hike in prices in 2022.\n\nWith the very high inflation presently, many are worried over how much burden the planned increments and removal of subsidy will place on the helpless masses in 2022.\n\nRead also: NIGERIA IN 2022: What to expect from economy\n\nPeter Ogaga, a Niger Delta human right activist, decried that the president administration has failed to plan ahead and has also toed the same wasteful way they accused the opposition of in 2015, hence the poor masses are going to suffer because of the wasteful manner the country\u2019s economy has been running.\n\n\u201cThe call for the government to lighten our burden will fall on deaf ears because there is no Plan B for the economy or its recovery. In 2022, we will be servicing $11.51 billion loan from the World Bank and $3.402bn from Exim Bank of China, among other debts. So, we should not expect respite from this administration. Expect the worst,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, if there had been well-thought-out plans, marching and sustained strategies, Nigeria would not be talking about subsidy removal now but export of refined crude oil products to the world.\n\n\u201cOur unemployment is among the worst in the world today. It is projected to reach 40 percent by the end of this year. But if we have three to four refineries, which are working, then allied companies such as petrochemicals, power stations, millions of youths will be employed. So, why is the government not interested in finding lasting solutions to our problems,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, there is no need for such calls as what Nigerians needed to have done was to protest to stop the unnecessary loans, which the government has been borrowing to mortgage the future of the country.\n\n\u201cWith the rising debt profile, Nigeria will do whatever the World Bank or IMF wants because they are part of the conditions for giving the loans and this means more hardship as such conditions require austerity measures. People can call on the government to make their burden lighter in 2022, but has the government ever listened to such calls?\u201d he said.\n\nThe historian and researcher is anticipating a much harder 2022 because the country will be entering the election year from 2022 and as expected, politicians will be saving money to buy votes during the election.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the politicians are saying to calm down the angry masses or how much tears the masses shed, the truth is, the politicians are more interested in their political ambitions than in better welfare for the masses in 2022, if not why borrow to fund elections when infrastructure, acclaimed reason for the loans, is still lacking,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn his part, Chijioke J. Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, encouraged the masses to make persistent calls on the government to lighten their burden in 2022, noting that such effort yielded results at #EndSARS protests in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe have the right to call the government to order, especially this present administration because it seems the government responds positively to crisis, if not why stop Jonathan from removing subsidy and also claiming there is no subsidy? The masses have to stand for their welfare or 2022 will sink more businesses, with attendant hardship,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nLooking at the economy, Onikoyi said that the economy has not met its growth projections this year and that it will affect 2022, hence people should tighten their belts.\n\n\u201cI read the latest report of the National Bureau of Statistics where the bureau said the economy grew 4.03 percent, slower than the 5.01 percent it grew in the second quarter of this year. Based on the slow recovery, the economic advisers will not go for stimulus or incentives that will impact the poor in 2022. They will give the anticipated advice, which will see the government increasing things rather than reducing costs,\u201d Onikoyi said.\n\nReflecting on the outgoing year, they expressed disappointment with the prevailing state of affairs, stressing that despite promises from the All Progressives Congress (APC) government their living conditions have become tougher which had made them poorer.\n\nSpeaking in separate interviews with BusinessDay Sunday, they said that the year 2021 had been a tough one and charged the government to focus on tackling the spate of insecurity ravaging the country, revamp the economy and initiate policies aimed at tackling poverty, creating jobs.\n\nHowever, several of those interviewed were pessimistic about the future and the ability of Buhari\u2019s led administration to turn things around in 2022, they say the President and his team appear to have lost focus.\n\nAjayi Adejare, Spokesman of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization (Afenifere) said ahead 2022, President Buhari should prioritize security, create jobs, revamp the economy to improve the living condition of Nigerians.\n\nAdejare, however, lamented that Nigerians had experienced untold hardship in the outgoing year which had made them poorer, stressing that nothing could be achieved with the current spate of insecurity across the country is not checked.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf you ask me I would say the government should focus on making sure that Nigeria does not go with the spate of insecurity now in 2022. Next year would be decisive for Nigeria because of the level of security now which is getting worse and it appears Buhari and his men don\u2019t know what to do. And don\u2019t forget that 2023 is the election year.\n\n\u201cAlso, the economy should be revamped as the cost of things are high in the market. The welfare of Nigerians, who have suffered greatly in the outgoing year, is priority; everything must be done on that. The country must be safe. So, for me it is security, economy, I mean safe atmosphere, or what can you do without a safe society?\u201d\n\nIdowu Omolegan, lawyer and activist said though it was obvious that the country was in a terrible state and needed to be rescued ahead of the new year, he had no confidence that the incumbent administration had the desire and capacity to do it.\n\n\u201cThe year 2021 was a tough one; we don\u2019t pray to see such a year again. I mean with the level of insecurity, killing and kidnapping. The economy is in a bad shape; look at the naira, unemployment is high. Right now there is nothing working here, and it does not look like the President and his team can take us out of this problem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but, the people in power appear to be living on another planet. Tomorrow you hear the President saying the terrorists had been defeated the next day you hear several people are killed. That is the country we are now.\n\nSpeaking further, \u201cBuhari should make the country safe, and fix the economy; those are the two basic things that affect me and you now\u201d.\n\nSimilar view was shared by Kehinde Kayode, public affairs analyst, who said the level of insecurity in 2021 had no doubt left the country many steps backward.\n\n\u201cA major area of concern that the Buhari administration must pursue come 2022 is to fight against insecurity. Only a secured country can promise economic growth and prosperity. The level of insecurity in 2021 no doubt left the country many steps backward from a lot of the many signs of progress achieved over time.\n\n\u201cThe government failed woefully in this area this year, and the hope is to not have worse situations by 2022,\u201d Kehinde said.",
          "summary": "Burdened as they have been in the outgoing year, Nigerians are begging President Muhammadu Buhari to lighten their burden in the incoming year, 2022.\nNigerians\u2019 burden emanates from a genealogy that is as clear as it is worrying.\nPeople can call on the government to make their burden lighter in 2022, but has the government ever listened to such calls?\u201d he said.\nAjayi Adejare, Spokesman of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization (Afenifere) said ahead 2022, President Buhari should prioritize security, create jobs, revamp the economy to improve the living condition of Nigerians.\n\u201cA major area of concern that the Buhari administration must pursue come 2022 is to fight against insecurity.",

          "title": "NIGERIA IN 2022: What to expect from economy",
          "text": "The year 2022 will probably not be significantly different from the current year as widespread poverty, high unemployment, and falling consumer purchasing power are expected to persist.\n\nEconomists polled in a BusinessDay survey all tipped Nigeria\u2019s GDP to expand in 2022, albeit at a slower pace than in 2021, as the low base effect that powered growth this year fades. They also highlighted key trends that will shape the economy in the new year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Africa\u2019s biggest economy returned to positive growth after recording its worst recession in three decades. The positive growth continued into 2021 as the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were fully eased.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) recorded positive growth of 0.51 percent, 5.01 percent, and 4.03 percent in Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively.\n\nInternational financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have predicted the economy will end at 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent for its full-year (2021). Both institutions expect a slightly higher growth rate in 2022, with the World Bank predicting 2.8 percent growth and the IMF forecasting 2.7 percent.\n\nBusinessDay polled 12 economic experts to obtain their outlook for next year and ascertain the key themes they expect to shape economic performance.\n\nAndrew S. Nevin, partner/chief economist, PwC Nigeria\n\nWe really want to see GDP grow faster than population growth. We know it has been below population growth for about seven years now. From PwC\u2019s perspective, the actual numbers don\u2019t capture the true size of the economy. We all know that more than 50 percent of the economy is not all captured in the official statistics.\n\nOur view is that it is growing faster and larger than we think. So, we believe that the NBS is going to rebase the economy in 2022 or 2023. When we rebased the economy about a decade ago, it was larger. Countries like South Africa just did a rebase and declared it 11 percent larger. And, I think if the economy is rebased, it could get significantly larger perhaps 20 or 25 percent.\n\nSo with that, I am optimistic that the economy will get better and better but I don\u2019t want to give a growth rate against an efficient GDP that\u2019s already a suspect.\n\nMoses Ojo, chief economist/head, research, PanAfrican Capital Holdings Limited\n\nWe estimate the economy to record a real GDP growth rate of between 2.9 percent and 3.2 percent for the year 2022, going by the fact that the effect of the pandemic is gradually moderating.\n\nThe growth is expected to be driven by the following sectors: telecoms, trade, manufacturing (food, beverages, and tobacco), and construction. The variables that are expected to weigh on economic output in the New Year are scarcity of foreign exchange, security challenges, and low crude oil production quantity among others.\n\nMuda Yusuf, former DG, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI)\n\nGrowth has been on a positive upward trajectory, though marginal. A great deal of it has to do with the base effect. The base effect threw up a significantly higher GDP growth and as we get to next year, the base effect is likely to begin to reduce.\n\nAnd if that happens, we may not see a growth rate as high as five percent. It is likely to remain around three percent or slightly above that. The GDP is not likely to be significantly higher than what we have. If anything it may be slightly lower because of the base effect.\n\nGenerally, the efficiency in output, productivity in the economy, foreign exchange situation, and other factors are still largely there. These things affect the growth rate, so fundamentally, nothing is likely to change around these things because many of them are structural related, some are policy-related and it is not easy to fix structural issues within 12 months. And for the policy problems, as long as the policymakers don\u2019t have any significant change of mind, the policy environment is likely to remain the same.\n\nYvonne Mhango, SSA economist, Renaissance Capital\n\nWe think a more secure growth recovery and softening inflation will give Nigeria scope for a one percentage point policy rate hike to 12.5 percent in 2022. We believe this will help to contain inflation, which we see in the lower double-digits and a depreciating naira.\n\nIt is encouraging that year-on-year headline inflation slowed for the eighth consecutive month to 15.4 percent in November, albeit slowly, after peaking at 18.2 percent in March. However, imported food price inflation remains elevated. We forecast headline inflation of 14.5 percent and 12.4 percent at year-end 2021 and year-end 2022, respectively, which implies the 6-9 percent inflation target will remain elusive for at least the short term.\n\nWhile we forecast a policy rate hike in 2022, we expect Treasury yields to remain flat, with upside risk from an increase in the government\u2019s domestic borrowing. We think there is an upside risk to our 2022 inflation forecast from insecurity, Foreign Exchange (FX) depreciation, high transport costs, a below-average harvest, and the high cost of imported food.\n\nRead also: 2021 IN REVIEW: Six themes that shaped the economy in 2021\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham\n\nI believe Nigeria\u2019s growth rate will revert to the sub-three percent levels in 2022, given the high base effect. Also, it is the year preceding another election; hence investors will be wary of who becomes the next President given the policy flip flop in Nigeria.\n\nNotwithstanding, government spending level always increases towards the election, which will support growth while pushing up the inflation rate.\n\nBy and large, we expect the economy to sustain its positive growth trajectory in 2022. On inflation, there are several downside risks like the removal of fuel subsidies, the adjustment in FX, and the implementation of a cost-reflective electricity tariff that will alter the declining inflation trend in 2022.\n\nDamilare Asimiyu, senior analyst, Afrinvest Securities Limited\n\nGoing into 2022, the Federal Government is expecting GDP growth at 4 percent. But looking at all the key indices and drivers, I feel that that is over-ambitious because the government will be focused on politics for the most part of the year.\n\nAnd with the concern of oil production and price uncertainty for Nigeria, I think the best we should be looking at next year is 2.8 percent or 3.2 percent best case not four percent.\n\nVictor Ofili, head of research, Cowry Asset Management Limited\n\nGDP grew at 4 percent in the third quarter of this year and inflation moderated, but the base effect was responsible for this. So, we expect that in 2022, those numbers will reverse.\n\nWe might see some slowdown in government spending in infrastructure but more for recurrent spending as we expect the government to fill its obligations to its workers. So, inflation might begin to pick up and that could affect purchasing power.\n\nAnd with a decrease in purchasing power and an increase in spending on critical infrastructure, we are seeing GDP slow down. Also, the base effect will slow down or wear out because most part of 2021, we saw an increase in GDP quarterly numbers.\n\nEconomists at Cordros Capital Limited\n\nWe expect inflationary pressure to persist next year but at a moderate pace. Our base-case scenario suggests headline inflation will average 13.64 percent year on year in 2022 full year, with the year-end figure settling at 13.55 percent year-on-year.\n\nOur forecast is based on the following expectations of a gradual increase in electricity tariffs towards a market reflective price, a depreciation of the currency to N440.0/$, and non-deregulation of the downstream sector, which would keep the price of PMS at the current level.\n\nWe also forecast a GDP growth of 2.65 percent year-on-year in 2022 full year. The oil sector is expected to grow by 9.42 percent year-on-year and the non-oil sector to grow by 2.11 percent year-on-year.\n\nWe expect the economy to remain on the path of growth. However, we anticipate the growth outcomes to remain below potential as economic activities continue to normalise and the impact of government stimulus fades.\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, investment research analyst, United Capital plc\n\nI expect the Nigerian economy to sustain expansion in 2022. While I expect the non-oil sector to decelerate from the low-base induced growth in 2022, I expect the oil sector to recover with additional aid from a low base in 2021. Overall, we forecast a base growth of 2.3 percent.\n\nEconomists at SBM Intelligence\n\nNigeria\u2019s 5.0 percent and 4.03 percent growth rates experienced in Q2 \u20182021 and Q3 2022 signify that the country can outperform the World Bank GDP growth forecast of 2.7 percent in 2021.\n\nRegarding 2022, we envisage strong GDP growth due to several factors, including oil price, oil production, expansion of financial services due to the MMO licenses issued to the telcos, and most importantly, an increase in FG spending due to the approaching election year. We project a 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent growth rate for the full year 2022.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst\n\nBarring the reintroduction of stricter containment measures, the economy would sustain a positive growth trajectory next year.\n\nFrom a statistical point of view, growth would be high in Q1-2022, and lower in Q2, Q3 and rebounds again in Q4-2022. Growth would remain fragile in real per capita terms. Again, several challenges such as exchange rate, mass unemployment, high cost of doing business, and subsidy saga facing the economy would be sustained next year\n\nEconomists at Vetiva Capital Management Limited\n\nSo far in 2021, we have witnessed consistently improving business activities, evidenced by the positive GDP growth in the first three quarters of the year, although much of this growth has been driven by the pandemic-induced weak base of last year.\n\nThe year also came with tough challenges that affected the operating climate for several companies. At the fore, we saw how currency-induced inflationary pressures eroded profitability margins, while supply disruptions and insecurity dragged sales volumes.\n\nFor 2022, we maintain a cautious outlook as we see the Nigerian economy running scared amidst several intimidating factors that lie ahead. Firstly, we see the possibility of higher borrowing costs amidst pre-election worries and the expectation of a hawkish stance from central banks in advanced economies.\n\nThis, we believe, may result in slower Capex roll-outs by corporates. Also, with inflationary pressures likely to remain for most of the year, profitability margins may be further weakened, and the situation could be much worse should the government discontinue fuel subsidies or raise the pump price of PMS in the second half.",

          "text": "Afenifere, the Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to consider the insecurity situation in the country as a war situation that requires recalling retired intelligence officers to complement the efforts of existing security apparatus to halt the war.\n\nIn a statement signed by Jare Ajayi, national publicity secretary of the body, Afenifere maintained that there is no more time to be wasted in being honest, decisive and comprehensive in confronting the security situation if the country is to be prevented from going under.\n\n\u201cApart from the bomb blast that happened in Maiduguri on the day President Buhari visited that city on Thursday, the Nigerian Immigration Services, also revealed in a letter to its border posts dated December 23, 2021, that terrorists from Mali plan to attack Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Capital Territory. The above are aside from kidnapping, killing, arson and burning of commuter buses on Kaduna highway and in Borno and Katsina states recently.\n\nAccording to Afenifere, the President must come out to give an ultimatum of two weeks to those carrying arms illegally to lay down their arms. Within the period, retired intelligence officers should be encouraged to report at the military formations nearest to them with a view to reintegrating them back into the system. Needed weapons and incentives must be provided just as the intelligence units within the security organs should be rejigged to weed out the fifth columnists in the army.\n\nOvertures should be made to certain powers that have control over our neighbouring countries from where terrorists infiltrate our country. Among such superpowers that need to be consulted are France, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, Germany, Israel and the United States of America. The rationale behind this is to seek for direct assistance in terms of logistics as well as for some of them, particularly France, to work on French-speaking neighbouring countries to help curtail insurgents using their territories to infiltrate Nigeria.\n\nAjayi added that beyond seeking foreign help, however, the federal government should be genuinely committed to removing insurgency and related criminality from our land.\n\nRead also: Make our burden lighter in 2022, Nigerians beg FG\n\n\u201cThis, it can do successfully, by stopping to treat bandits and terrorists with kid gloves, by genuinely providing needed equipment to the army and other security agencies, by truly engaging the youths into ventures that would earn them a livelihood, by no longer treating some bandits and terrorists as sacred cows and by liberalizing the economy in such a way that the cost of commodities and services in the country would come down considerably.\n\nAbove all, states and local governments that are willing should be allowed to have their own policing system up to the level of investigation and prosecution without hindrance.\n\nAfenifere spokesman asserted that it is disheartening that terrorists had the temerity to launch attacks near Maiduguri on Thursday, December 23, 2021, around the time President Muhammadu Buhari, the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, was visiting Maiduguri and parts of Borno State.\n\nReports also have it that the Nigeria Immigration Service has put its officers at various border posts on red alert of a looming terrorist attack on the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nAccording to the Immigration Service, the step was based on the intelligence report it received from the Presidency that some terrorists from West African neighbour, Mali, want to move through the Nigeria-Niger Republic border to launch an attack in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe letter dated December 23, 2021, was titled \u2018Terrorists Plan Attacks In Abuja\u2019 and signed by the Land Border Patrol Commander, Edirin Okoto, on behalf of the Acting Comptroller General Of Immigration Service, Idris Jere\u201d according to Punch newspaper of the same day.\n\nAjayi added that if steps suggested above are taken, the vow made by the Chief of Army Staff, (COAS) Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru last week Thursday would be easy to fulfill. It would be recalled that the COAS had, during his visit to the 7th Division, Maimalari Cantonment in Maiduguri last week asserted that the Nigerian Army is \u201ccommitted to ending the (Boko Haram) war and other security challenges such as banditry and kidnapping and other crimes bedeviling the country\u201d.\n\nTo Afenifere, it was not the first time such a declaration would be made either by President Buhari or the security chiefs. But rather than the insecurity being checkmated, the situation has been going from bad to worse.\n\n\u201cIt is high time President Buhari heeded the advices being given from various quarters including the ones by the Eminent Nigerians led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the one that emanated from the Inclusive Security Dialogue Retreat, which held in Abuja a few weeks ago and attended by the same Olusegun Obasanjo, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, Reverend Samson Supo Ayokunle, CAN President, Edwin Clark and many other leaders from ethnic nationalities. They had called on the president to urgently convey a national conciliatory conference to address the underlying issues of our challenges that successive governments have ignored.\u201d",

PDP is the ruling party in Edo State and will continue to be, as some people find it difficult to believe.

Edo people are one and united as they don\u2019t want division in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is only the people that can give you political power; no one outside Edo State can do that.

In the spirit of the Yuletide, they deserve to have a feel of it just like every other child\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further, Mr. Otueroro said \u201cWe are doing this to promote inclusiveness because every child matters and deserves equal right to access the world irrespective of their birth conditions\u201d.\n\nHe also called for more supports for people with disabilities \u201d I want to use this opportunity to solicit more supports from the public and stakeholders for children with special needs because really these people, their families and caregivers need the supports to alleviate the suffering they go through\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman of the occasion, Mr. Kingsley Oromonsele hailed the foundation for putting smiles on the faces of the physically challenged in the state. According to him \u201d every 24th of December, we look forward to this party. This is because for the past nine years, this foundation has not failed to lavish Christmas party on children with disabilities. COF has indeed demonstrated love for special children and I wish to thank the Foundation on behalf of many children with special needs here today\u201d\n\nMr. Oromonsele however called on Edo Government to urgently domesticate the Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities (Prohibition) Acts 2018 which was passed by Federal Government in 2019 to protect the physically challenged persons in the state.\n\n\u201cWe see Edo state government as our father and Disability Act as our last hope. Currently the discrimination physically challenged persons face is too much; in education, health, employment and even housing, they are too many to mention. But much of these challenges have been addressed in the Act that once domesticated in Edo State, will bring relief to us\u201d.\n\nAlso, the matron of COF and a former Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues in Edo State, Hon.

          "text": "Abubakar Malami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Justice and Attorney General, has explained why President Muhammadu Buhari will not sign the Electoral Amendment Bill.\n\nMalami added that because the bill did not pique Nigerians\u2019 interest, Buhari will not sign it into law.\n\nAccording to the AGF, the proposed bill has a high cost, promotes insecurity, and is discriminatory.\n\nThe country\u2019s Chief Law Officer, speaking on Radio Kano, stated that the signing of the new bill would result in legal challenges.\n\nAccording to Malami: \u201cThis means that you will repeat the general elections 18 times. Today INEC requires N305 billion for the 2023 general elections. Now if the general election, which is not the newly proposed electoral system, will cost this much, how much will it cost to do the same election in the APC? It might cost at least N200 billion because it will involve everyone.\n\n\u201cAlthough the good side of the law is that INEC is required to monitor it.\n\n\u201cTherefore, if it is assumed that every political party will spend N200 billion, how much will then be spent in conducting the same primary election in 18 political parties just to produce a qualified candidate? Let\u2019s assume there are about 60 million politicians in the country, what about the remaining over 160 million Nigerians who have nothing to do with politics? Are you fair to them?\n\n\u201cAll the people want are good projects, good road from Abuja to Kano, portable drinking water, good education, school feeding program and the rest of them. Are you fair to the 160 million Nigerians using their wealth just to conduct primary election to produce a party candidate, despite other demands by the public?\n\n\u201cMy answer to this is that, to spend this N305 billion that will be given to the INEC and the about N200 billion to be given to the political parties is not fair to the remaining 160 million Nigerians who have no business about politics and political appointments. Their business is just a better life in Nigeria. This is the issue of cost implications.\u201d",

          "text": "Rochas Okorocha, the former governor of Imo state and senator representing Imo West Senatorial District, said he would wait for the police to free and release his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, who was detained last Sunday, for the next 24 hours.\n\nOkorocha was captured yesterday by Vanguard in Owerri, while he (Okorocha) reacted to the arrest of Nwosu, at St Peters Anglican Church in Eziama, Nkwerre Local Government Area of Imo state, during an outing service of Nwosu\u2019s late mother.\n\nHe said that 24 hours was enough legally for the police to make public the offence of Nwosu and failure to do that he (Okorocha) would take legal action to demand his release.\n\nAs captured by Vanguard from Okorocha, \u201cI am going to wait for 24 hours to know what Nwosu has done. We want to know his offences. 24 hours is enough for the police to do that which is legal. They should let the world know about his offences and failure to do that I will take legal action to demand his release.\u201d\n\nThis is coming as Nwosu, who was the Imo state 2019 governorship candidate of the Action Alliance, AA, arrested last Sunday, has spent a night in the police custody as the police were yet to officially state his offences or make official if he has been released.\n\nThis is just as his supporters were expecting that their boss could have been granted bail based on personal recognition and his status in society.\n\nIt should be recalled that the arrest of Nwosu, has clashed with the governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodimma and his predecessor, Rochas Okorocha.\n\nBoth have embarked on a verbal war against each other laying accusations and counter-accusations.\n\nAccording to Okorocha, \u201cUgwumba Uche Nwosu, my wife and daughter were at the church outing services, when a group of men armed and in police uniform rushed into the church and started shooting in the course of their activities they pushed down my wife and torn my daughter cloth.\n\n\u201cThere was no invitation or warrant of arrest from the security and the way it happened it gave us the feeling of kidnap. In the process, many were injured. We watched Nwosu dragged into the bus carrying Imo govt number. My people identified them as the security agents from the government house.\n\n\u201cI got the state commissioner of Police who said Nwosu was arrested on the order of the IGP, what got us surprised was how Nwosu was dragged to the bus one still wonders what story the Imo state govt has framed up against Nwosu, and the IGP, I know could not have done that except for a high level of misinformation.\n\n\u201cUzodimma has shown tremendous hate on me and my family why should any sane person arrest one in church outing service of his late mother.\n\n\u201cYou recall last week Uzodimma said he was going to announce the names of those involved in insecurity in the state. Hope Uzodimma is the hating governor of Imo state that has deceived Abuja, IGP to go and arrest Nwosu. We wait for Uzodimma, on the 3rd of January to point out those who are involved in the insecurity.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Imo state government, through the state commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, said: \u201cOkorocha is in panic and trying to weep up sentiment. A man who looted the state dry. He should wait for due process to take place since he now knows it\u2019s the security agencies that arrested Nwosu.\n\n\u201cOkorocha is indicting himself and his beginning to talk incoherently and it will not save him. There is no need to play politics with the arrest.\n\n\u201cThe best advice I want to give him is that he should stop panicking and there is no need govt be involved in the arrest of Nwosu. The next thing Okorocha should do is to wait for the outcome of the police arrest.\u201d",

          "title": "Abuja artisans cry out: AEPB officials extorting, forcing us into crime",
          "text": "Artisans and roadside workers earning their daily incomes in and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have cried out to authorities of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), especially the management of Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) over alleged and incessant extortion by some personnel of the board raiding their business premises.\n\nThe artisans claimed the AEPB officials often extorted money from them for allegedly flouting FCT sanitation laws.\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint, the artisans called government\u2019s attention to activities of the AEPB officials who moved around in their numbers daily in a patrol van.\n\nThe artisans said they (AEPB) would order them to part with some money for using their business premises, failure of which their tools would be impounded and taken to the Area 3 Garki office of the agency where they would be made to pay fines without receipts before release.\n\nSpeaking to one of Blueprint reporters in tears, a roadside vulcanizer at Wuye, Kazeem Oyinlola, said his experience with AEPB has not been palatable.\n\n\u201cI have always been their victim anytime they come here. There was a time they came to Wuye here and carried my machine in my absence. That day, after I resumed work, I had to rush back to Karmo hospital because my wife was on admission there. When I was told that AEPB people came and carried my machine, I quickly returned and went to their office at Area 3. There, they told me to pay N10, 000 or face a mobile court. After much plea, it was reduced to N5, 000. That day, I had nothing on me because I hadn\u2019t worked before I rushed to Karmo. It was our union chairman that assisted me with the amount before my machine was released. To my surprise, there was no receipt. When I asked, they warned me never to ask them for any receipt.\n\n\u201cAs if that was not enough, they have been coming here almost thrice in a week. Anytime they come in their truck, they would beckon on us and demand that we give them some money. If anyone says no, they would come down from their truck and confiscate the tools; so any time they come, even if we don\u2019t have money, we would run round to borrow and give them before they would go. They don\u2019t even care whether we have worked that day or not.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am tired of AEPB. I don\u2019t want to steal; this is the only thing I can do to feed myself, wife and a daughter. They are driving me into crime if this continues. So far, I can say that since this year, I have spent almost N50, 000 to these people. Where do they want us to go? Are we not part of the society again?\u201d he asked in anger.\n\nCorroborating Oyinlola\u2019s position is Mr Victor Nwabanike, who specialises in tyre alignment within the same premises.\n\nHe said: \u201cAEPB has taken my tools away many times especially as the Christmas approaches. Whenever that happens, we would follow their vehicle to somewhere nearby where they would ask us to pay some money after which they would release the tools without any receipt. Even yesterday, they came around and parked my tools again. I quickly mobilised some money for them before they left. That is the challenge we face here. I don\u2019t litter the environment here and I am not close to the road, so I don\u2019t know why they chose to be doing this to us here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nwabanike, \u201cinstead of this money we pay these people without receipt, government should create a layout clearly marked out for rent by artisans whereby the government can generate income instead of this regular extortion without any receipt.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the development, Chairman of Artisans and Roadside Auto Mechanic in Wuye, Mr Adeniyi Owolabi, said the association comprises mechanics, vulcanizers, car wash operators, food vendors, and herbal medicine sellers (agbo).\n\nHe said though mechanics have never been extorted by AEPB personnel, others like vulcanizers, car wash operators, food and herbal medicine sellers have complained about alleged extortion by AEPB.\n\n\u201cThey do come to our area here to carry vulcanizers\u2019 tools and car wash as well as those who do car alignment. They will pack their tools to their office because they couldn\u2019t offer the taskforce anything. Most times, I bail them out myself without any receipt. Here, we are not criminals; we come here to work and help ourselves. In fact, our presence here has prevented criminals from entering the estate. Before now, from this place to the foot of the hill, it was complete bush. However, our presence has prevented criminals from entering the estate.\n\n\u201cLet AEPB stop harassing our members so that they can do legitimate work to help themselves and those they render services to.\u201d\n\nSimilar views were expressed by some artisans in Jahi, Kado Estate, Gwarimpa, Kubwa and a couple of other areas.\n\n\u201cIt is terrible that we could be treated this way by the AEPB people as Nigerians. Are they saying we are not entitled to living in and around Abuja? They should not drive us into crimes. Survival has been very tough for every Nigerian, artisan inclusive. We are using our hands to earn legitimate livelihood, yet we are being persecuted. Let government look into it and save our lives and by extension the nation from further security woes. Nigeria can\u2019t afford another security challenge,\u201d said Sunday Yusuf, an artisan in Kubwa.\n\nSecurity implication\n\nSpeaking on the security implication of this raid on the artisans, a retired police officer and CEO of Crime Guard, Mr Teidi Ameh, said it portends a dangerous signal for the already-tensed security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cLet official policies allow sleeping dogs to lie. Apart from the services those categories of people offer, when a large pool of such people that are already used to handling hard metals are exposed to crimes, residents of cities and estates would find it difficult to stay peacefully. I have personally noticed the misbehaviour of some of those boys in AEPB trucks; unfortunately, some of them also exhibit criminal tendencies such that one wonders how they got that job. But their activities should be moderated so that it doesn\u2019t exacerbate the current security situation.\u201d\n\nAllegations false \u2013 AEPB\n\nBut the management of AEPB has denied the alleged extortion by its personnel, describing it as baseless, mere insinuations and fake news targeted at ruining AEPB\u2019s reputation.\n\n\n\nAEPB Deputy Director Information and Public Relations Mrs Janet Peni made the agency\u2019s position known in an interview with Blueprint. She said officials of the board were concerned with maintaining sanity in the city and would not compromise, noting that linking AEPB to AMAC officials was wrong.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe present AEPB under the watch of Kaka Ali has taken additional steps to consolidate on the successes it had recorded and would not limit the standards.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbuja Environmental Protection Board is different from Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and their activities don\u2019t concern us, we must not forget that AMAC is a local government situated in the Federal Capital City.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are keen on our roles in ensuring sanity in the Federal Capital Territory and we would be happy if those claiming that our men harass come to our office with evidence.\n\n\n\n\u201cAEPB doesn\u2019t compromise; anyone found guilty would face the full wrath of the administration.\u201d",

We have new injuries and it won\u2019t stop. People at the green table, in offices, make these decisions.\n\n\u201cWe are struggling, we\u2019re pressing our players. I have maximum respect for what the players did. We do changes because of injuries. We don\u2019t change for tactical reasons any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impressed with my players but super concerned,\u201d added Tuchel. \u201cMaybe we made a big mistake letting players play after corona and one or two training sessions.\n\n\u201cBut obviously they [the Premier League] made us play and so we play.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated his call for five substitutes to be allowed in the Premier League again to help deal with the pandemic, but he said there was \u201czero chance\u201d of that happening.\n\n\u201cWe are not protecting the players because we are the only league who doesn\u2019t have five changes,\u201d Tuchel said.\n\nThe rule has remained in the rest of Europe\u2019s top leagues since it was introduced in summer 2020.\n\nVilla assistant manager Gary McAllister, who was standing in for boss Steven Gerrard after he tested positive for Covid, said bringing back five substitutes was \u201ca must\u201d.\n\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl said his team will have to \u201cmake a miracle\u201d to face Tottenham on Tuesday, scheduled just over 48 hours after their 3-2 victory over West Ham.\n\n\u201cWe face a very strong side with two days\u2019 rest and no chance for training. We have to have a good hand in picking the right players and hope that we do,\u201d Hasenhuttl said.\n\n\u201cWe have no time to prepare and we have to see who is fit, but this is what we have to do if you want something from the Premier League.

We have Covid times, we have three competitions in which we have high ambitions and want to be as successful as we can be.\n\n\u201cSo far, as far as I know, there has been no offer from any other club and as long as this is the case he will stay.\u201d\n\nRangnick also said he shares Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp\u2019s concerns over signing players who are not vaccinated against coronavirus.\n\nKlopp recently said a player\u2019s vaccinated status would be \u201cinfluential\u201d in the club\u2019s decision to sign them.\n\n\u201cI think it could be a consideration,\u201d Rangnick said.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue the clubs seriously have to think about. If you sign a player knowing from the first day that he has not been vaccinated, you have to be aware he might not be available.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only for 10 days, but this could happen regularly in Covid times.\u201d\n\nUnited had to shut the first-team section of their Carrington facility due to a Covid outbreak and have had two Premier League games postponed in December.\n\nThe Premier League said 84% of players are on their \u201cvaccination journey\u201d according to recent figures, leaving 16% unvaccinated.\n\nThe figures are in line with comparable age groups across society in the UK.\n\nRangnick used the example of Bayern Munich\u2019s Joshua Kimmich as evidence players should get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\nThe Germany international, 26, recently said he regrets not being vaccinated after suffering a lung problem as a result of Covid-19.\n\n\u201c[Kimmich] was extremely hesitant at the beginning and I think in the meantime he has realised it might be a good idea to get vaccinated,\u201d Rangnick added.\n\n\u201cHe caught Covid and still has some problems with his lungs. I think this is an issue where of course everybody can, and should have, his free will. But in football, especially at this level we are playing at, we need to try to convince our players to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt should be in the interest of the players to be vaccinated, but in the end it\u2019s a decision that each club has to take by themselves and find the best possible solution.\u201d",

          "text": "There have been more Covid-related flight cancellations globally as the week starts, capping off a miserable festive period for thousands of people.\n\nMore than 1,400 flights have been scrapped on Monday, with Chinese and US destinations being the worst hit, the FlightAware data tracking website says.\n\nUS airlines say the disruption is due to crews testing positive or isolating.\n\nHong Kong is banning all South Korea\u2019s Korean Air flights for two weeks, after positive cases among some arrivals.\n\nIn all, more than 8,000 flights have been grounded over the long Christmas weekend that began on Friday.\n\nAlthough the number of cancellations is a small percentage of the total, it is higher than normal and comes at a time of year when many are travelling to spend time with family and friends.\n\nIn a separate development, US authorities are monitoring dozens of cruise ships hit by Covid cases while sailing in the country\u2019s waters, with several of them reportedly denied port in the Caribbean, AFP news agency reports.\n\nRecorded Covid cases are rising sharply around the world, largely driven by the Omicron variant.\n\nDespite early findings that Omicron is milder than other coronavirus variants, scientists are concerned by the sheer number of infections being recorded.\n\nThe majority of the flights cancelled on Monday are those by Chinese companies, according to FlightAware. They include China Eastern, which cancelled 368 flights, and Air China, with 141 cancellations.\n\nAirports in Beijing and Shanghai appear to be the worst affected, with nearly 300 cancellations combined. The Chinese authorities have not commented on the issue.\n\nThe airport in the northern Chinese city of Xi\u2019an is also on the list.
