          "title": "Where Nigeria went wrong \u2014 ASIODU (2)",
          "text": "\u2022Why Buhari, others must take pay cut\n\n\u2022Disintegration \u2018ll worsen our problems\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nYesterday, we published the first part of an engaging interview with Elder statesman, Chief Philip Asiodu. Today, we serve you part of the chat where he spoke on why President Muhammadu Buhari and all elected public officials must take pay cut, how disintegration will worsen Nigeria\u2019s problems and how to make all the states of the country viable.\n\nYou said you have hope\u2026\n\nIt is a question of leadership. The elders (Burdened Elders) were consulting before COVID-19 stopped our meetings, to find 12 or so younger people from each state who will subscribe to a vision to transform to 1st World status and unite to save the country, not like in 2019 when nine of them were presidential candidates.\n\nThey should be united behind one, not more than two. They have the demography numbers even in the voters register. They should be united for 2023 election and agree to four or five-year plans to transform Nigeria to 1st World status and global significance.\n\nLooking back, seeing our resources, and how we started we should be among the First World countries by now.\n\nIt is still possible if we get a leadership of younger people that agrees that there must be a Vision; 2040 or 2050 divided into 4 or 5 year Plans. The plan has to be respected, and followed, and they should utilize remaining institutional memory as much as possible.\n\nMy definition of younger people is 25 to 67 years. When we were planning what\n\nwould have become the Fifth National Development Plan in 1975, the people (India) who helped us set up our Planning Commission were completing their 11th Five-year Plan. We had abandoned our Fourth Plan in 1975 and stopped planning.\n\nIn those days, we used to consult widely among the ministries and different states. Look at the Fourth Development Plan, 1970-75, and see the various projects in various states and in all sectors with detailed descriptions, costs, locations, etc.\n\nIn the Industrial Sector, the first priority was modernised agriculture and Agro-allied industries, valued added development of petroleum, gas, and solid minerals, then textiles, iron and steel products, etc. Ministries used to produce Annual Reports\n\nevery year on targets and achievements.\n\nThere has been no report since 1975 about what the ministries are doing. So, how do you monitor? There is no substitute for planning whether you are in the public or private sector.\n\nHalted development\n\nI was the Chairman of the committee that approved Festac. The built up Festac today is one quarter of what we approved. It went up to Blackwater Lagoon, and we had planned places for workers and others, and corridors of transportation to take them to Ikeja Industrial Estate. It was Alhaji Lateef Jakande who brought them to Dolphin Estate. How were you to move to Ikeja Industrial Estate from Dolphin then?\n\nI was Chairman of the Committee that persuaded late Gen. Yar\u2019Adua when he was Minister of Transport, and the government to let the RTP of Paris which after surveying cities of Africa, said Lagos and Cairo were ready, and started planning mass transit for Lagos and Cairo the same day.\n\nBefore then, Konisberger Report of the UN had as far back as in 1964 told us to build monorail mass transit in Lagos from Ikeja to Ebutte-Ero.\n\nThey could see where Nigeria was going. However, General Buhari came to power in 1984 and cancelled the Lagos Metro begun by Jakande in 1983.\n\nThen, in 1991 or 1992, the Military Government of General Babangida sent a delegation to the commissioning of the Cairo Mass transit. We cancelled our own but sent a delegation to the commissioning of Cairo mass transit.\n\nWe lost our deposit of 80 million US dollars and were fined 600 million US dollars by International Arbitration Board because RTP said they had mobilised to site and had started work and sought compensation.\n\nBy the time we settled with Paris Club, it must have become about 3 billion dollars because it was part of the Paris Club debt.\n\nYou can imagine the damage the military had done. Did they do it alone? No. They did it with the support of civilians.\n\nSo much would have happened if we continued our trajectory of development and so much would have been saved.\n\nAll states are viable agriculturally\n\nWith education, planning and good leadership, there is no state that cannot be productive in terms of agricultural resources. Okpara, Awolowo, Sardauna developed the Regions in the First Republic with agricultural produce. We abandoned agriculture, fiscal federalism, plans, planning and prudent management of resources.\n\nWe must go back to priority investment in high quality education, infrastructure development especially transportation and communications, and non-discriminatory zero-tolerance fight against corruption.\n\nOn anti-corruption, there are two things that can still be done by the present Government before they go if they would agree. Like we have in advanced democracies, they should limit the amount of money anybody can contribute to a party in a year, and limit the amount of money a party can spend on elections and party activities.\n\nIf we can get these two done, then the question of submitting yourself to a godfather or selling your properties to raise money for election will stop. If you borrowed money or spent heavily to contest election, your first task after election is to recoup and this fuels corruption. It also distorts the cost of government procurement and projects.\n\nCutting cost of governance\n\nThen, we have to cut salaries of elected officials, which are too attractive and much beyond our GDP so that we won\u2019t have would-be robbers as leaders.\n\nThese are critical issues to be addressed and not just restructuring. Whether you restructure or not, if the attitude of those going into government is to be on the Forbe\u2019s list of Rich People, even if you turn my street into a state , we will get nowhere.\n\nMisunderstanding restructuring\n\nWhen you ask those who want to do restructuring, some are talking about devolution and restoration of regional governments based on the zones. How many governors are ready to do that? There is no point pursuing what you know is farfetched. Some are talking about revising revenue to force restructuring.\n\nHowever, if we are to pursue agro-allied industrialisation, in five years each state will have hundreds of thousands of people paying taxes from income. Once the taxes are not used to pay armies of assistants, special assistants, etc, and phoney civil servants, and going on reckless foreign trips the money would be enough to develop our states.\n\nDisintegration will worsen our crises\n\nIt is not surprising to hear otherwise level headed people, given the current challenges, talk as if the breaking up of Nigeria into several parts would be a solution since to them Nigeria is too difficult to administer. I have no doubt that the solution to our problem does not lie in disintegration. It is not possible to divide Nigeria neatly into a given number of successor countries. A collapse of the Nigerian State will most likely result in an unpredictable number of mini-states controlled by warlords. Imagine leaving Lagos and encountering a Customs Post in Ikorodu, then Ijebu Ode, then Ofuse, then Benin City, etc. or travelling Northwards, in Sagamu, then Ibadan, then Ilorin, then Minna and so forth. It will be horrendous to have Nigeria as a failed State.\n\nThe fault will be that of the so-called elites. There will be no economic progress and civilization will be halted and life will be very insecure. We would find ourselves in a situation of general anarchy and violence. It is a prospect which should shock us to exploring solutions to our current problems.\n\nWhat the ordinary man desires is shelter, food, educational facilities to ensure his children\u2019s advancement in life and of course adequate and improving availability of power, health and transportation infrastructure. He is really not interested in the power struggles among politicians.\n\nGood patriotic visionary leadership and good governance which result in rapid economic and social progress and improving standard of living and quality of life for the great majority of the people are what will lead to national cohesion and stability.\n\nHow remarkable the success of Malaysia in uniting the Malays and Chinese and smaller communities of Indians and others in a multi-religious, multi-ethnic state. Again, China with her 1.4 billion people unites many diverse ethnic and linguistic groups. We also have the Indian example.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "They should be united for 2023 election and agree to four or five-year plans to transform Nigeria to 1st World status and global significance.\nThe plan has to be respected, and followed, and they should utilize remaining institutional memory as much as possible.\nWhen we were planning whatwould have become the Fifth National Development Plan in 1975, the people (India) who helped us set up our Planning Commission were completing their 11th Five-year Plan.\nLook at the Fourth Development Plan, 1970-75, and see the various projects in various states and in all sectors with detailed descriptions, costs, locations, etc.\nIt is not possible to divide Nigeria neatly into a given number of successor countries.",

We want to sympathise with the families of those who lost their lives and houses were burnt. It is so unfortunate one of the military guys that was killed was an indigene of Imo State.\n\n\u201cAccording to the security report, the 80 per cent of the planning that led to the attack of the Owerri Correctional Center took place in the Oguta area. The suspect according to the security report was an escapee of the Owerri correctional centre during the time of jailbreak.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good to know this, it was the villagers who invited the military because of the security threat from this suspect that was killed and on seeing the military he engaged the military with his gun while they were trying to arrest him and in the process, he was killed.\n\n\u201cIt was his men that now went and attacked the military and took two of the military officers to a particular place and collected their arms and ammunitions, collected their uniforms and beat them to death,\u201d Emelumba said.\n\nLifeless body of young man discovered in Enugu\n\nVanguard gathered that the deceased was allegedly murdered by unknown gunmen.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Public Relations Officer, PRO, of the Enugu State Police Command, Daniel Ndukwe, the command has commenced investigation to fish out the perpetrators.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThere was a reported case of murder of a young man identified as Stephen Ajah, along Ozalla/Agbani Road in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State, by yet-to-be identified armed men.\n\n\u201cThe lifeless body of the said young man was rushed to the hospital by Police operatives, where he was confirmed dead and the corpse deposited in the mortuary for preservation and autopsy.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, investigation to fish out the perpetrators has commenced. Further development will be communicated.\u201d\n\nSuspected hoodlums cause panic in Umuahia\n\nTension took over the city when reports filtered in that suspected hoodlums were enforcing the sit-at- home order, from the Uzuakoli road area.\n\nThere was tension as shop owners hurriedly closed their shops and motorists deserted the roads. Banks also shut their gates for fear of attacks.\n\nSome shop owners at the Isi Gate area who spoke to Vanguard said some people started running and they had to close their shops and fled.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what happened but some people came running that unknown gunmen were coming to Isi Gate from the Uzuakoli road area, enforcing the sit- at -home. They started running and we closed our shops and ran after them. After some minutes, we discovered that it was a rumour.\u201d\n\nHowever, calm soon returned to the city as there were no gunmen on sight. Traders returned to their shops while motorists, some of who had abandoned their vehicles also returned. Most of the banks only opened their pedestrian gates.\n\nNjaba BIM office raided by Naval ratings\n\nAccording to a press statement signed by Uwazuruike\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Elder Chris Mocha, \u201cthe Biafra flag and signpost were destroyed while cash and other valuable items were carted away\u201d.\n\nWhile confirming that no casualty was reported and no arrests were made because members were not in a meeting during the afternoon raid, Uwazuruike however lamented that \u201cthe overzealous naval ratings broke the doors and ransacked the office\u201d.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe heavily armed Naval officers, who arrived the area in two Toyota Hilux vans, were drafted from the Naval Base at Naze, near Owerri.\n\n\u201cThey had on arrival, forced the doors open, destroyed the toilet facilities, ransacked the rooms and parlour and carted away vital documents and made away with some valuables, including the sum of N11,000 kept in an envelope being contributions by BIM members.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear at press time, the motive behind the raid on BIM office but a resident who pleaded anonymity told the group\u2019s leadership that \u201cbefore they left the premises, the Naval men threatened to burn the nearby houses in the area if the landlord fails to produce the suspected IPOB leader\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Cajethan Ekwonye and Emmanuel C Nwokeji, Orlu Zonal Leader and Regional Adminstrator for Njaba, respectively, have denied any link to the members of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, in a statement issued to journalists yesterday, and duly countersigned by the Senior Special Assistant, SSA, on Media and Publicity to BIM Leader, Elder Chris Mocha.\n\nThey confirmed that one of their members, Mr. Calistus Udeogaranya, who was arrested by soldiers since August at his residence along Oguta Road, Mgbidi, in Oru west local government area of Imo State has been remanded in the Correctional Center, Owerri.\n\nThey insisted that \u201cMr. Calistus Udeogaranya was an innocent member of BIM, a peaceful organization that does not harm or constitute a security risk to the society and demanded that his case file be transfered from the Magistrate Court to a High Court that has jurisdiction to entertain his matter.\u201d\n\nImo lawmaker calls for ceasefire\n\nMeantime, the Lawmaker representing Oru West State Constituency in Imo State, Dominic Ezerioha has called for a ceasefire regarding the bloody clash between the military and some youths of Izombe community in Oguta Local Government Area of the state, that claimed lives, burnt houses last Friday.\n\nThe lawmaker made this appeal in a statement he issued to newsmen in Owerri, while condemning the incident.\n\nEzerioha said the killing of military men and the killing of indigenous people of Izombe were all crimes against humanity.\n\nBut Vanguard gathered the cause of the clash between a group of youth and the military was linked to two different areas that the military men were attacked by oil smugglers and the other one was that the military officers were invited by some villagers due to a breach of security by one of the villagers whose name was given as Obele and eventually the suspect engaged the military.\n\nHowever, the Imo lawmaker said : \u201cAs a member from the Ohaji/Egbema, Oguta & Oru West Federal Reserve Constituency, we, the people of Oru West condemn in its entirety, the act of brutality, killings, burning of houses and all other acts that diminished our respect for humanity from both parties.\n\n\u201cThe killing of military men and the killing of Izombe indigenes are both crimes against humanity under our local and international laws. I appeal to my dear Izombe youths to help the situation by returning what belongs to the military if any. With tears in my eyes, I honestly urge our youths, people of Izombe, the entire Oguta LGA and our gallant military personnel to ceasefire while the government finds a lasting solution to the burning issues.\n\n\u201cOn the above score, may I again appeal to the families of Izombe people and that of the Nigeria military personnel that lost their lives during this uncontrolled incident and also to the Nigeria Army authority to apply peaceful human techniques for peace while awaiting the modalities of findings and lasting solutions from the government.\n\n\u201cHowever, peaceful existence is one of the most important attributes to an existing community in the world. We want peace in Izombe land.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile the people of Oru-West State Constituency sympathise with the families of those that their homes were affected and lost the lives of their beloved in this unacceptable saga. May their souls rest in peace,\u201d Ezerioha said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Nigerian Senate on Tuesday adopted electronic transmission of election results, a position that was contained in the Conference Committee report submitted to the chamber.\n\nThe electronic transmission of election results which is a proviso in clause 53 of the Electoral amendment act places on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) the right to transmit results without subjecting their discretion to any other organ as was firstly captured that generated controversy.\n\nAdoption wasn\u2019t, however, without heated debate which was brought under control by the presiding Senate President.\n\nBefore the adoption in the Committee of the whole, Senator Adamu Aliero and former governor of Kebbi State in his submission urged Senators to support the amendment in order to strengthen democracy.\n\nHe said: This is a move that will deepen our democracy and a move that will make the electorate to vote according to their conscience. This will put paid to criminals having their way as people of questionable character can no longer be voted.\n\nSenator Smart Adeyemi representing Kogi West opposed the amendment on clause 87 which deals with direct primaries of political parties. He advocated strongly for some political parties who lack the capacity to organise direct primaries. He said it should be left for party executives to conduct indirect primaries.\n\nHowever, Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele representing Ekiti Central Senatorial districts said every card-carrying member of a political party should be allowed to vote for their aspirants.\n\nAccording to him, the mode of party primary which is determined by all party members would be more democratic than indirect where a few party executives vote for aspirants.\n\n\u201cI support this motion and like to mention specifically that in clause 87 that every card-carrying member of any political party should be able to vote and it is a way of giving power back to the people.\n\n\u201cThis is not about any political party, every political party will enjoy this, therefore, let every party member have the opportunity to vote who they wanted.\u201d\n\nSenator Abdulfatai Buhari representing Oyo North corroborated in his submission, saying those opposed to direct primaries were afraid, wondering that if a contestant was as popular as he thinks, then he or she needed not to be afraid.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s practice democracy in accordance with the global best practices. I see no reason why anybody should be afraid of direct primaries as it goes to solve problems of aspirants.\n\nSenator Shuaibu Lau representing Taraba North Senatorial district called for caution in not tieing political parties to a form of conducting primaries. He said the mode of conducting primaries should be left for parties to decide.\n\nHe maintained: \u201cI agree with amendment of clause 87 which has to do with political party primaries.\n\nWe must, therefore, not tie parties to one way traffic of conducting primaries and not because there are beliefs that governors are hijacking parties and not free parties to democratically elect their leaders.\n\nWhen the chamber resorted to the committee of the whole, the electronic means of transmitting election results was passed, while political parties are to determine how their primaries are conducted.\n\nElectoral Amendment Act: Chaos in Senate over electronic transmission of result clause",

The only odium and rival of God in that palace are the deities or idols. There cannot be two kings in a palace.\n\n\u201cIdols must not be in a king\u2019s palaces. Go and tell the kings. You married a wife and she brought another man to the house, how would it be? That is what the kings in Yorubaland are doing to God. Yet, they are looking for God\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cOur fathers who were monarchs who worshipped deities were wrong. I take a bold step to apologise for their mistakes. The damage deity worshipping by monarchs has caused us is monumental. I will lead the path to right the past mistakes in the Yoruba traditional system. We can celebrate our exceptional fathers, we must not worship them unless we want our children to worship us too.\n\n\u201cIdol worshipping is a strange religion to kingship. This is not about Christianity or Islam. It is a pure dictate of the Creator after creation. Kings as representatives of God prime responsibility of promoting His oneness from worshipping His rivals\u201d, further stressing that only monarchs carry the same name with God, but the same monarchs are promoting His rivals.\n\n\u201cMy royalty is synonymous with the one brought by the founding father of Yoruba crown (Oduduwa). Only God is the king. Oduduwa fought deity and won Obatala. The greatest of God\u2019s name is \u2018King\u2019. No one else bears that name with him except monarchs. As such, we are just earthly representatives.\u201d\n\nHe further said that kings are expected to respect the likeness of God and steer clear off His don\u2019ts, which will cause direct access to him and unquestionable authority, noting that due to the promotion of His rivals (deities) by some kings, they are spiritually cut off by resigning themselves to static gods.\n\nOluwo explained that there is a need to illuminate all the monarchs in Yorubaland on their superiority over deities.",

          "text": "Seplat Energy Plc, Nigeria\u2019s foremost indigenous energy company, has disclosed its readiness to champion the quest to improve Africa\u2019s energy access by repurposing its operations with a focus on cleaner energy.\n\nThis came from its decision to make sure that Seplat is committed to carbon neutrality just as the Federal Government said it would partner with Seplat Energy to achieve its energy transition plan \u2013 Universal Access to Energy by 2030; Zero Carbon Emission by 2050; and Industrialization to Alleviate Poverty and Drive Economic Growth.\n\nVice-president Yemi Osinbajo, stated this at the 2nd Seplat Energy Summit in Abuja, where the company transitioned from an oil & gas company to an energy company, with renewables and cleaner energy as the priority.\n\nOsinbajo described the transition as laudable, just as the company, with others, is poised to assist the country meet its net-zero emissions plans by 2050, through the COP26 Energy Transition Council process.\n\nRepresented by the Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, Osinbajo said Nigeria\u2019s energy transition would not be limited to incremental steps but transformational steps.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a broader set of policies that must align with energy security, which must foster a smooth energy transition across various levels of energy demands. And gas will continue to play a critical role in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition which will create lots of opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s energy value chain.\n\n\u201cOver the next decade, every energy segment in Nigeria will be affected by this shift in energy supply and demands\u2019\u2019, he stated.\n\nSeplat Energy Plc Chairman, Ambrose Orjiako, said to achieve the cleaner energy provision goal, they plan with associates to replace the wood people use in homes with the use of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), which is cleaner energy.\n\nThe transitioning to an energy company aligns with global trends in energy transition where there is proactive planning for a world where fossil fuels will start to decline in the global energy mix and aligns with the company\u2019s renewed focus on the entire energy value chain with an emphasis on cleaner and more sustainable forms of energy to power Nigeria.\n\nOrjiako said the company believes that gas is the transition fuel, and \u2018\u2019Seplat today delivers 50 per cent of gas needs in the country. We are very aligned with the Federal Government\u2019s initiative in this regard and we can only see this increasing. Replacing diesel generators with cleaner renewable energy will solve Nigeria\u2019s power deficit\u2019\u2019, he asserted He stated that one of the ways the company is focused on making sure the environment is well protected, aside from launching its \u2018Tree for Life\u2019 project to plant trees that would create jobs and improve the environment from the first quarter of 2022, is its commitment towards ending gas flaring in its operations by 2024, six years ahead of government targets.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of State , Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said the ministry endorsed Seplat Energy as the flagship company to drive Nigeria\u2019s energy transition, while he calls for multiple pathways to energy transition to ensure that no country is left in the process of achieving net-zero emission by 2050.\n\nSylva noted that it\u2019s important to ensure massive efforts towards increasing energy efficiency and productivity by facilitating changes in consumption patterns and lifestyle choices which will expand renewable energy for power supply and directions within and across the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that renewable energy offers favourable prospects for localised entities because of the complexities of technology transfer, and the intensity of the slow, and medium-scale for segments,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nOne of the keynote speakers, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and energy commentator, Daniel Yergin, who spoke on the need for the global shift from fossil fuel to other energy forms, calls for more diversity in the energy mix to improve energy access. He said: \u201cThe more diversity you have in your energy mix, the more energy security you have.\u201d\n\nYergin took the audience on an enthralling ride on the base of his book, \u2018\u2018New Map -Energy, Climate Change and the Clash of Nations\u2019\u2019, as well as enlightened them on the various issues of geopolitics and energy in the era of rising political turbulence fueled by the call for transitioning and why some countries are skeptical to transition.\n\nMs. Damilola Ogunbiyi, the CEO & Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, in her presentation on \u2018\u201dBalancing Sustainability Revolution with Energy Poverty- Lessons from around the World\u201d, said African countries must realise the opportunities inherent in transitioning to cleaner energy to improve energy access for the continent\u2019s growth.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, said gas resources would help Nigeria to close the gap in the transition to clean energy.\n\nThe summit had in attendance ministers, governors, members of the National Assembly, royal fathers of Seplat Energy\u2019s host communities, leaders of public and private institutions, investors, and heads of shareholders groups. Seplat leveraged the energy summit to unveil its new logo.\n\nRoger Brown, Seplat Energy CEO, said the name change reflects the company\u2019s belief that the greatest opportunity ahead is to supply the right mix of energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and rapidly growing population.\n\nThe summit examined how to tackle Africa\u2019s electricity deficit against the background of the challenge of climate change and stakeholders at the summit said Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, should play a crucial role in leading the continent\u2019s energy transition as improving access to energy is essential to the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAt the first panel session during the summit, Mike Sangster, the CEO of TotalEnergies Nigeria, raised concern about the capital cost of renewable energy which, he claimed, is higher than the capital cost of traditional energy although the recurrent cost of renewable energy is cheaper.\n\nSangster said: \u201cFinancing is one of the major issues that need to be addressed\u2019\u2019, as he noted that most of Nigeria\u2019s renewable energy projects need power purchase agreements that are bankable. \u201cAfrica needs more energy which must be clean and net-zero fossils, not zero fossils,\u201d Sangster said.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX), Oscar Onyema, at the panel session, said the country needs $400 billion to power 25 million homes within 30 years through renewable energy, an aspect of attaining zero carbon emission by 2050, and this funding can happen through the capital market.\n\nOn access to funding, he said N750 billion was raised for investments in 2020 through bonds, and this year, it is estimated to reach N1 trillion.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The President stated this at the opening of a two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat organised to assess progress made towards the achievement of the nine key priorities of his administration.\n\nThe president will end his tenure on May 29, 2023. A statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, quoted him as assuring that all major transport projects under the PIDF would be completed before he leaves office.\n\n\u201cOn transportation, we are growing the stock and quality of our road, rail, air and water transport infrastructure.

These include the 11.9km Second Niger Bridge, 120 km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, 375 km Abuja \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Zaria \u2013 Kano Expressway and the East West Road. Most of these projects are expected to be completed within this 2nd term of our Administration,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president said his administration had made tremendous progress on railway projects, saying upgrading of the railway network had been extended with the recent completion of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan line.\n\n\u201cThe Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail line has finally been completed and commissioned after 30 years of its conception. Work is expected to commence very soon on the Port-Harcourt Maiduguri line and Calabar \u2013 Lagos Coastal Line to connect the Southern and Eastern States of our country. Progress is also being made on the upgrading of our airports, with the state-of-the-art facilities in line with world class safety standards.\u201d\n\nThe president expressed delight that over the past two years, ministers have rendered reports to the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on their activities related to the achievement of their ministerial mandates.\n\n\u201cSome of the notable achievements include the establishment of InfraCo Plc in 2020, as a world class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, to be managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager. The Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund was also established in 2020 with more than $1billion in funding.

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\nSeplat, Nigeria\u2019s foremost indigenous oil & gas company has disclosed its readiness to champion the quest to improve Africa\u2019s energy access by repurposing its operations with a focus on cleaner energy.\n\nThe indigenous oil concern said this flowed from the decision to make sure that the country was committed to carbon neutrality upon the realisation that something must be done by everyone concerning decarbonisation.\n\nThis emerged even as the government has pledged to partner the company to achieve its energy transition plan, comprising the universal access to energy by 2030; zero carbon emission by 2050; and industrialisation to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth,\n\nThe Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who was at the second Seplat Energy Summit, held at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, recently, where the company transitioned to an energy company with renewables and cleaner energy the priority, described the move as laudable.\n\nHe stated that the company had put the right foot forward, adding that the company, along with others would assist the country to meet its net-zero emissions plans by 2050 through the COP26 Energy Transition Council (ETC) process.\n\nRepresented by the Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, Osinbajo said Nigeria\u2019s energy transition cannot be limited to incremental steps but transformational ones.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a broader set of policies that must align with energy security, which must foster a smooth energy transition across various levels of energy demands, and gas will continue to play a critical role in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition which will create lots of opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s energy value chain.\n\n\u201cOver the next decade, every energy segment in Nigeria will be affected by this shift in energy supply and demand, \u2019\u2019he stated.\n\nSeplat Energy Plc\u2019s Chairman, Ambrose Orjiako, said to achieve the cleaner energy provision goal, the company plans, along with its associates, to replace all of the wood people use in homes with the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) which is a cleaner source of energy.\n\nThe transitioning to an energy company, the Seplat chairman said, aligns with global trends in energy transition where there is proactive planning for a world where fossil fuels will start to decline in the global energy mix .\n\nHe further stated that it was in agreement with the company\u2019s renewed focus on the entire energy value chain with an emphasis on cleaner and more sustainable forms of energy to power Nigeria.\n\nOrjiako pointed out that the company believes that gas remains the transition fuel, noting that: \u2018\u2019Seplat today delivers 50 per cent of gas needs in the country\u201d and \u201cis very aligned with the federal government\u2019s initiative in this regard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can only see this increasing. Replacing diesel generators with cleaner renewable energy will solve Nigeria\u2019s power deficit,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe stated that one of the ways the company was focused on making sure the environment is well protected, aside launching its \u2018Tree for Life\u2019 project to plant trees that would create jobs and improve the environment from the first quarter of 2022, was its determined commitment towards ending gas flaring in all of its operations by 2024, six years ahead of government target.\n\nThe Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, in his comments, said the ministry endorsed Seplat Energy as the flagship company to drive Nigeria\u2019s energy transition.\n\nHe called for multiple pathways to energy transition to ensure that no country is left in the process of achieving net-zero emission by 2050.\n\nSylva noted that it was important to ensure massive efforts towards increasing energy efficiency and productivity by facilitating changes in consumption patterns and lifestyle choices which will expand renewable energy for power supply and directions within and across the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that renewable energy offers favourable prospects for localised entities, because of the complexities of technology transfer, and the intensity of the slow, and medium-scale for segments,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nOne of the keynote speakers, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, and energy commentator, Daniel Yergin, who spoke on the need for the global shift from fossil fuel to other energy forms, called for more diversity in the energy mix to improve energy access. \u2018\u2019 The more diversity you have in your energy mix, the more energy security you have,\u201d he stressed.\n\nYergin took the audience on an enthralling ride on the base of his book, \u2018\u2019New Map -Energy, Climate Change and the Clash of Nations\u201d, and enlightened them on the various issues of geopolitics and energy in the era of rising political turbulence fuelled by the call for transitioning and why some countries are sceptical of the process.\n\nChief Executive Officer and Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, Ms. Damilola Ogunbiyi, in her presentation on \u2018\u201dBalancing Sustainability Revolution with Energy Poverty- Lessons from around the World\u201d, said African countries must realise the opportunities inherent in transitioning to cleaner energy to improve its access for the continent\u2019s growth.\n\nIn his intervention, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, said gas resources would help Nigeria to close the gap in the transition to clean energy.\n\nThe summit which saw Seplat unveil its new logo, had in attendance ministers, governors, members of the National Assembly, royal fathers of Seplat Energy\u2019s host communities, leaders of public and private institutions, investors, and heads of shareholder groups.\n\nRoger Brown, Seplat Energy\u2019s CEO said the name change reflected the company\u2019s belief that the greatest opportunity ahead was to supply the right mix of energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and rapidly growing population.\n\nThe summit also examined how to tackle Africa\u2019s electricity deficit against the background of the challenge of climate change with stakeholders at the summit agreeing that Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, must play a crucial role in leading the continent\u2019s energy transition as improving access to energy is essential to the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAt the first panel session during the summit, Mike Sangster, the CEO of TotalEnergies Nigeria, raised concern about the capital cost of renewable energy which he claimed is much higher than the capital cost of traditional energy, although the recurrent cost of renewable energy is cheaper.\n\nSangster said: \u201cFinancing is one of the major issues that need to be addressed\u2019\u2019, noting that most of Nigeria\u2019s renewable energy projects needed power purchase agreements that are bankable. \u201cAfrica needs more energy which must be clean and net-zero fossils, not zero fossils,\u201d Sangster said.\n\nGroup Managing Director of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX), Oscar Onyema, at the panel session, said the country needs $400 billion to power 25 million homes within 30 years through renewable energy, an aspect of attaining zero carbon emission by 2050, adding that the funding can happen through the capital market.\n\nOn access to funding, he said N750 billion was raised for investments in 2020 through bonds, and this year, it is estimated to reach N1 trillion, as he urged private firms to embrace green bonds, noting that it is a global funding means towards capital for the energy transition period.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s Head of Investment Banking for the Middle East and Africa, Miguel Azevedo, said the gospel of renewable energy will force the development and creation of a democratised system for Nigeria\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\u201cIt will allow for a change in the economic and business model of Nigeria\u2019s energy sector,\u201d Azevedo said.\n\nThe panel moderator and a former Vice President of the World Bank as well as Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Arunma Oteh, who is a Non-executive Director at Seplat, said energy transition remains a challenge for everyone and enjoined all to key into Seplat\u2019s drive for clean energy.\n\nShe said there are global funding means including a N40 trillion energy access fund globally for countries driving climate change to leverage on.\n\nAlso speaking at the panel, the Executive Secretary of Nigerian Content Development Management Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote said attaining zero carbon emissions by 2050 requires capital investment, commitment, and capacity building.\n\nHowever, to attain this in 30 years, Wabote said it would mean that 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s electricity would have to come from renewable energy sources.\n\nHe noted that for oil to dominate coal for power generation, it took about 160 years in the past, adding that to attain a shift from oil to renewables in the next 30 years remains a huge task.\n\nSeplat said investors are also buying into the prospects of the company as evidenced in the continued increase in the shares of the company with about 80 per cent positive returns this year, saying this could rise as Nigeria\u2019s transition priorities present significant opportunities for the company to leverage.\n\n\u201cThese prospects range from the development of gas-to-power initiatives, development of LPG markets to alleviate the use of biomass, and development of renewable energy to serve large areas of the country not currently served by the national grid,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Analysts urge caution, say local production, exports way out of FX crisis\n\n\u2022Adesina: $15bn annual investment required to bridge infrastructure gap\n\n\u2026POLITICAL NOTES\n\nThe retreat provided a platform for both Osinbajo and Adesina to showcase themselves, leaving many wondering if it was a quasi-presidential debate. Is Osinbajo running? Is Adesina running too? There are indications that some PDP leaders may be wooing Adesina as their southern presidential candidate. THISDAY will keep you posted\u2026\n\nJames Emejo and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nIn a major break with President Muhammadu Buahri who has consistently opposed the devaluation of the naira, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday openly advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to adjust the naira exchange rate \u201cto be as reflective of the market as possible to boost supply.\u201d\n\nPast efforts to persuade the president to allow the adjustment of the exchange rate had met a brick wall.\n\nBut in quick reaction, analysts cautioned that the suggestion by the vice president could have a damaging effect on the economy. They advised the federal government to improve local production of goods and exports in order to solve the current foreign exchange (FX) crunch.\n\nThe experts, who spoke with THISDAY, argued that the effective exchange rate, even by International Monetary Fund (IMF) standard, was between N435 and N440, stressing that the over valuation was less than five per cent.\n\nThis is just as the President of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, yesterday stated that Nigeria requires $15 billion annual investments on infrastructure to bridge the huge infrastructure gap in the country.\n\nThey both spoke on the first day of a two-day Mid-term Ministerial Performance Review retreat, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOsinbajo said the naira exchange rate was artificially low. He lamented that this was discouraging foreign capital inflow to the country.\n\nThe vice president called on the CBN to review its strategy on forex and ensure that the naira value reflected the market reality, rather than the \u201cartificially low\u201d rate that was deterring investors from bringing foreign exchange into the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAs for the exchange rate, I think we need to move our rates to be as reflective of the market as possible. This, in my own respectful view, is the only way to improve supply.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get new dollars into the system, where the exchange rate is artificially low. And everyone knows by how much our reserves can grow. I\u2019m convinced that the demand management strategy currently being adopted by the CBN needs a rethink, and that is my view.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the naira is changing at N411 to $1 at the official side of the market, while the same goes for about N565 at the parallel market.\n\nAccording to the vice president, \u201cThere must be synergy between the fiscal and the monetary authority. We must be able to deal with the synergy; we must handle the synergy between the monetary authority, the CBN, and the fiscal side.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it appears that there is competition\u2026 If you look at some of the interventions, you will find that those interventions are interventions that should be managed by ministries.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should handle MSMEs interventions, and we should know what the CBN is doing. In other words, if the CBN is intervening in the MSME sector, it should be with the full cooperation and consent of the Ministry of Industry.\n\n\u201cSometimes you will get people who are benefiting more than once because we simply have no line of sight on what is going on, on one side.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there should be one clear economic plan, not two, saying, \u201cWe cannot have a CBN-led economic plan and a government-led plan. We would end up duplicating, and even there may be beneficiaries of grants benefiting multiple times.\u201d\n\nHowever, speaking in separate interviews with THISDAY, analysts said the current exchange rate was a direct result of the country\u2019s inability to boost local production and increase exports to, among other things, strengthen the local currency.\n\nThe analysts disagreed with Osinbajo\u2019s call for further devaluation of the local currency, warning that the dangers of such move far outweigh the benefits. They said the implications of devaluing the naira could be \u201cquite scary.\u201d\n\nNigeria currently operates a managed float exchange regime, where the CBN can intervene in the market whenever it deems appropriate.\n\nChairman, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja Branch, Professor Uche Uwaleke, said the first casualty of another devaluation would be the 2022 appropriation bill.\n\nUwaleke said, \u201cIt means the 2022 budget, which is predicated on N410.15 per dollar, is dead on arrival. The vice president, obviously, means well. But this statement is capable of triggering panic buying and speculation in the forex market (official and parallel) and further complicating things for the CBN.\u201d\n\nHe also said the argument that devaluation would incentivise local investors was questionable, as other variables, particularly, insecurity also acted as disincentive to capital inflow presently.\n\nHowever, Uwaleke said devaluation would force down the volume of imports and reduce the pressure in the forex market temporarily.\n\n\u201cBut have we thought of the impact it would have on pump price of fuel and the multiplier effects?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe added, \u201cHow about the knock-on with regard to inflation and interest rates, especially, at a time when inflation rate remains elevated?\n\n\u201cIs high inflation rate not inimical to investments, whether local or foreign? The argument that naira devaluation will incentivise foreign investors remains to be seen, as other factors, such as insecurity, equally play a part.\u201d\n\nUwaleke stated further, \u201cTo be sure, the naira has suffered several devaluations in recent past. It has neither solved the fundamental problem of helping to diversify the export base nor curbed unbridled imports. Doing so yet again will not change anything. Rather, it\u2019s a recipe for high poverty and unemployment levels.\n\n\u201cAgain, suggesting that the CBN should discontinue its forex demand management strategy to the effect that certain items are excluded from accessing the official window has grave implications for exchange rate and the economy. If anything, it negates the import substitution drive of the present administration.\u201d\n\nHowever, Uwaleke said the good news was that the CBN had sufficient external reserves to meet genuine demands for forex at the investors and exporters window.\n\nIn his contribution, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said there were several ways of managing the exchange rate crisis, including enhancing local production capacity, which the CBN had been committed to achieving.\n\nEkechukwu stated, \u201cThe situation with our current exchange rate does not have one solution, but a myriad of them, nonetheless, they are interlinked\n\n\u201cEnhancing the local production capacity, which creates availability of the products and opportunities to export, must be our focus.\n\n\u201cWe need to do everything we can to stop importation of petroleum products, by encouraging as many private refineries as possible to come on board.\u201d\n\nEkechukwu added, \u201cInsecurity has indirect adverse effect on our exchange rate in many ways. These are the things to address, in order to contain the soaring exchange rate in the short run.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director/Chief Executive, SD&D Capital Management Limited, Mr. Idakolo Gbolade, said the country needed to boost local output and strengthen its export capacity in order to resolve the exchange rate disparity.\n\nGbolade explained, \u201cThe major challenge with FX rate has been that Nigeria has been exporting less goods and services than it imports over the years.\n\n\u201cThis problem has persisted with various administration and the intervention policy of the CBN is just to ensure that international trade improves within the confines of our reserves.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cDevaluation of the naira now, though a good initiative, could hamper efforts to increase production and international trade.\u201d\n\nBut the Managing Director of the Financial Directive Company Limited, Mr. Bismark Rewane, argued that the solution to the present challenge the forex market was, \u201cto increase supply at an efficient price.\u201d\n\nRewane, who is a member of President Buhari\u2019s Economic Advisory Council, described the suggestion by the vice president as a healthy debate.\n\nHe added: \u201cTechnically, what you are looking for is convergence of rates towards a fair market value. One thing must be clear, an overvalued exchange rate is not a good thing for a country. Therefore, it is important that you get the exchange rate to a fair value that is acceptable to the market, manufacturers and everybody.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is a perception by the market that the currency is overvalued because the difference between the official and the parallel market rate is so wide that there is a motivation for speculation, which is not good for the economy.\n\n\u201cAnd the answer to that is to increase supply at an efficient price. That efficient price is a converged rate because if you move one rate, the other one should naturally appreciate to a fair value. So, the most important thing is that an overvalued exchange rate does more harm to the economy.\n\n\u201cAs long as a currency is overvalued, people would begin to bet against that currency. So, what you are seeing today is a bet against the currency that either now or later, the currency would adjust. So, this is a healthy debate, but an overvalued exchange rate is not good for any economy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further at the retreat, Osinbajo stated that despite the challenges of funding and other issues, the implementation of the N2.3 trillion Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) had made significant impact across different sectors. He said it had also helped the country to effectively tackle the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, by creating jobs and safeguarding existing ones, while also putting the economy on the path of sustainable growth.\n\nOsinbajo stated, \u201cThe ESP tried to mitigate the shock of COVID-19, but also took the opportunity to try to tackle longstanding structural challenges, while repositioning the economy for the future.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo explained that following the global pandemic, \u201cThere were sharp declines in some key sectors: transportation sector declined by 49 per cent, hospitality sector fell 40 per cent, the education sector fell 24 per cent, real estate declined by 22 per cent, trade declined by 17 per cent, and construction declined by 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cBut since the ESP implementation began, which was credited as a major reason why Nigeria exited recession faster than predicted, data showed that these sectors have rebounded to positive growth:\n\n\u201cTransportation to 77 per cent, hospitality to two per cent, education to one per cent, real estate to four per cent, trade to 23 per cent and construction to four per cent.\u201d\n\nThe vice president further said, \u201cIn response (to the pandemic), the president took two actions. The first was to set up a small inter-ministerial committee headed by the Minister of Finance to quickly examine the implications of and the immediate mitigation steps that would be taken for the economic shocks we were experiencing. The second step, which Mr. President took, was to ask that we draw up a full Economic Sustainability Plan to provide at least a 12-month response to the fallout of the pandemic. And Mr. President asked me to chair the committee to draw up the plan and later to implement it.\u201d\n\nAdesina: $15bn Annual Investment Required to Bridge Infrastructure Gap\n\nMeanwhile, in his paper, titled \u201cNigeria\u2019s Economic Resurgence: Learning from the African Experience,\u201d Adesina identified infrastructure as critical for unlocking the full potential of the country\u2019s economy. He called for priority attention to financial innovations, saying government alone cannot afford the huge financial cost.\n\nThe former Nigerian Minister of Agriculture proposed that the private sector should be given incentives in form of tax credits to encourage investment in infrastructure.\n\nAdesina said, \u201cTo be sustainable and more efficient, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) should be accelerated to finance major infrastructure across Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s institutional investors, especially the pension funds, should invest in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cGovernments can also implement \u2018Infrastructure Asset Recycling models,\u2019 where existing infrastructure assets on government books can be turned over to the private sector, freeing up financing for governments to invest in new infrastructure needs.\u201d\n\nHe said sustainable financing approaches, such as PPPs and infrastructure asset recycling, would allow Nigeria to attract significant private sector investment into infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking on trade, the AfDB president stated that the Africa Continental Free Trade Area presented a major opportunity for Nigeria given that consumer and business expenditures in Africa are projected to rise to $6.7 trillion by 2030.\n\nHe said significant support should be directed toward boosting the country\u2019s industrial manufacturing capacities, adding that Nigeria should also move rapidly to the top of selected value chains, such as automobiles, computers and electronics, textile and garments, and food manufacturing, transport, and logistics.\n\nThe former minister, however, admitted that much of the gains would depend on the ports in the country, where, according to the sector operators, the cost of exporting 100 tons of cargo in Nigeria is $35,000, compared to $4,000 in Ghana.\n\nAdesina stated, \u201cToday, the leading ports for West Africa are in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin Republic. All these countries have modernised their port management systems, leaving Nigeria far behind. Nigeria can learn from Morocco\u2019s world-class Tangier-Med port. The port is unique in that it is an industrial port complex, and a platform that has over 1,100 companies.\n\n\u201cThey collectively exported over \u20ac8 billion worth of goods in 2020. Companies located at the Tangier-Med port have allowed Morocco to move up the global value chains, including automobiles, automotive parts, aeronautics, agriculture and food manufacturing, textiles, and logistics. Annually, over 460,000 cars are manufactured in the zone for exports. And more interesting is that the bulk of the human resources to do these are Moroccans.\n\n\u201cI took a walk at the Tangier-Med Port. I actually thought they were on vacation, as I did not see people \u2013 just machines, haulers, automated systems moving containers in what looked like a well-synchronised maze, with incredible efficiency.\n\n\u201cThere were no kilometres of trucks waiting to get to the port. Your Excellency, we should not be decongesting the ports in Nigeria, we should be transforming the ports. This must start with cleaning up administrative bottlenecks, most of which are unnecessary with multiple government agencies at the ports, high transaction costs or even plain extortions from illegal taxes, which do not go into the coffers of the government.\n\n\u201cHere is the lesson: Nigeria should rapidly modernise and transform its ports. Ports are not there for revenue generation. They are for facilitating business and exports, and stimulating industrial manufacturing, and competitiveness of local businesses and exports.\u201d\n\nHe also urged the federal government to relaunch the \u2018Growth Enhancement Scheme\u2019 and the e-wallet system by putting millions of farmers at the heart of agriculture.\n\nAccording to him, there would be a dramatic turn-around in national food production if this is accorded immediate attention.\n\nUsing Sudan as a case study, he said AfDB helped the country to finance the revolution of wheat with heat tolerant varieties, by producing 65,000 metric tons of seed, which is equivalent to 660 Airbus 380 aircraft parked on a landing strip.\n\nAdesina Sudan moved from 25 per cent self-sufficiency to 54 per cent in just two seasons, and it expected to become a net exporter of wheat within three years.\n\nHe said, \u201dWe also supported Ethiopia to cultivate the heat tolerant varieties on over 184,000 hectares. Interestingly, these same heat tolerant varieties were introduced to Nigeria when I was Minister of Agriculture and we worked hard to give them to farmers in the Lake Chad Basin.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency Mr. President, You may wish to know that during the insecurity in the area, my staff at the time, led by Dr. Oluwasina Olabanji, the then Executive Director of the Lake Chad Research Institute, and his team, stayed in the fields, protected the seeds being multiplied, and risked their lives.\n\n\u201cWhen insecurity became much more serious, they moved the varieties to Kadawa valley in Kano. Dr. Olabanji deserves a national award. I was on the farms in Kano with several Seriki Nomas or farmer heads.\n\n\u201cThey could not believe that wheat could be as tall as they were! These varieties yield five tons per hectare compared to average yield of 1.5 tons per hectare \u2013 a 400 per cent increase! Nigeria should take advantage of the work of the Bank on this and scale up cultivation of heat tolerant wheat across northern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also said arising from COVID-19, Nigeria\u2019s economy recorded a negative growth rate of 1.8 per cent in 2020, while the African continent posted a negative growth rate of 2.1 per cent growth rate, its lowest in two decades.\n\nAdesina said AfDB, which launched a $10 billion Crisis Response Facility to support countries and provided $289 million in budget support to Nigeria, projected the country\u2019s economic growth rate to rebound to 2.4 per cent this year and reach 2.9 per cent by 2022.\n\nHe said the recovery would depend on access to vaccines and tackling debt issues as Africa had only two per cent of its population vaccinated, compared to 54 per cent in the United States and 75 per cent in Europe.\n\nAdesina assured that the AfDB would invest $3 billion in support of local pharmaceutical industries in Africa, including in Nigeria, while urging the federal government to decisively tackle its debt challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe issue is not about debt-to-GDP ratio, as Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is still moderate.\n\n\u201cThe big issue is how to service the debt and what that means for resources for domestic investments needed to spur faster economic growth. The debt service to revenue ratio of Nigeria is high at 73 per cent.\n\n\u201cThings will improve as oil prices recover, but the situation has revealed the vulnerability of Nigeria\u2019s economy. To have economic resurgence, we need to fix the structure of the economy and address some fundamentals.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s challenge is revenue concentration, as the oil sector accounts for 75.4 per cent of export revenue and 50 per cent of all government revenue.

          "text": "\u2022Directs Defence Ministry to take initiative\n\n\u2022Set to deemphasise over-dependence on foreign supplies\n\n\u2022Assures of completion of key projects like second Niger bridge before leaving office\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, Monday, stressed the readiness of the federal government to de-emphasise dependence on foreign supply of military weapons to fight security challenges facing the nation by commencing local productions.\n\nTo this end, he has instructed the Ministry of Defense to create a modest military industrial complex for the local production of weapons to meet some of the requirements of the country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nThe President made this disclosure in his opening remarks at a two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat, organised to assess progress made towards the achievement of the nine key priorities of his Administration.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the industrial complex would address Nigeria\u2019s over-dependence on other countries for military equipment and logistics.\n\nThe project, he explained, was being implemented under the Defense Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON), a military department responsible for arms manufacture.\n\nHis words: \u201cTo address our over-dependence on other countries for military equipment and logistics, I have instructed the Defence Ministry to create a modest military industrial complex for the local production of weapons to meet some of the requirements of the country\u2019s armed forces. This is being implemented under the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON), a military department responsible for arms manufacture\u201d.\n\nOn other steps being taken by his government to strengthen national security, President Buhari said it was gratifying to note that Nigeria has received six A-29 Super Tucano propeller-driven aircraft, which were currently being used for training, surveillance and attack by the military.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that only recently, we received six A-29 Super Tucano aircrafts as part of our efforts to boost the nation\u2019s campaign against insecurity. The propeller-driven aircrafts are being used for training, surveillance and attack by the Military.\n\n\u201cAs part of the efforts towards strengthening our national security, we have increased investments in arms, weapons and other necessary equipment; expanded the National Command and Control Centre to nineteen states of the federation; and established a Nigerian Police Trust Fund, which will significantly improve funding for the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u201cWe have also approved the sum of N13.3 billion for the take-off of the Community Policing initiative across the country, as part of measures adopted to consolidate efforts aimed at enhancing security nationwide,\u201d he added.\n\nHe highlighted some of the federal government\u2019s notable achievements in the last two years by in the areas of infrastructure, transportation, economy, electricity supply and the petroleum industry, among others.\n\nThe President also assured Nigerians that the 11.9km Second Niger Bridge, 120 km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and other key projects under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) would be completed within the second term of this administration.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn transportation, we are growing the stock and quality of our road, rail, air and water transport infrastructure. The PIDF projects are also advancing remarkably. These include the 11.9km Second Niger Bridge, 120 km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, 375 km Abuja \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Zaria \u2013 Kano Expressway and the East West Road. Most of these projects are expected to be completed within this 2nd term of our Administration.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that his administration had made tremendous progress on railway projects in the country, noting that upgrading of the railway network was being extended with the recent completion of the Lagos\u2013Ibadan line.\n\n\u201cThe Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail line has finally been completed and commissioned after 30 years of its conception. Work is expected to commence very soon on the Port-Harcourt Maiduguri line and Calabar \u2013 Lagos Coastal Line to connect the Southern and Eastern States of our Country. Progress is also being made on the upgrading of our Airports, with the state-of-the-art facilities in line with world class safety standards,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight that over the past two years, Ministers have rendered reports to the Federal Executive Council on their activities related to the achievement of their Ministerial Mandates.\n\n\u201cSome of the notable achievements include the establishment of InfraCo Plc in 2020, as a world class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, to be managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund was also established in 2020 with more than USD 1Billion in funding. In addition, we have launched the Nigeria Innovation Fund by the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). This is aimed at addressing investment opportunities in the domestic technology sector: data networking, datacenters, software, Agri-tech, Bio-tech, and more\u201d.\n\nOn the economy, the President said the nation witnessed three consecutive quarters of growth, after negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe GDP grew from 0.8% in 2017 to 2.2% in 2019, but declined in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the downward trend in global economic activities triggered by the COVID-19 Pandemic. As at Second Quarter 2021, GDP growth rate was at 5.01%, the highest since the inception of this Administration.\n\nCommenting on the power sector, President Buhari noted that the implementation of a \u2018Willing Buyer-Willing Seller\u2019 Policy has opened up opportunities for increased delivery of electricity to underserved homes and industries.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the execution of critical projects through the Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme, will result in achieving the national goal of improved power supply by 2025.\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Act signed into law on 16th August 2021, the President reiterated his directive to the Implementation Committee to complete all processes for the successful operationalisation of the Act within 12 months.\n\nOn efforts to empower the youth and other vulnerable groups by enhancing investments in the Social Intervention Programmes, the President said he has approved the expansion of the National Social Register (NSP), which is the official database for the implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme by one million additional households.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe have established the N75 billion Nigerian Youth Investment Fund created to boost the Nigerian economy through leverage and access to finance for youths.\n\n\u201cThe Fund should serve as a catalyst to unleash the potential of the youth and to enable them to build businesses that will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. These accomplishments are a testament to the fact that all hands are on deck in establishing a solid foundation for even greater successes in future\u201d.\n\nHe warned all Ministers and Permanent Secretaries to take seriously all issues relating to the implementation of their mandates towards the attainment of the laudable objectives of the government.\n\nPresident Buhari used the opening ceremony to unveil the Presidential Priorities Performance Management System and Dashboard, explaining that the initiative, which has been in effect since January this year, had provided him the opportunity to track projects in real-time with live data.\n\nHis words: \u201cIn our continuing drive to ensure accountability, we have incorporated a Performance Management Framework into the functions of the Central Delivery Coordination Unit for ease of tracking of the Ministerial Deliverables along the lines of the nine priority areas of this administration.\n\n\u201cThis initiative has provided me the opportunity to track the performance of all ministries and by extension my administration. This process has been in effect since January 2021 and today, it gives me great pleasure to unveil the Performance Management System and Dashboard to track projects in real-time with live data and early warning system to proactively resolve bottlenecks\u201d.\n\nIn view of the importance of this year\u2019s retreat, President Buhari announced that he would sit through all the sessions to listen to the cumulative assessment of this administration\u2019s performance over the last 2 years.\n\nEqually, the President would join in discussions on the best approach and strategies to implement planned policies, programmes and projects that could significantly diversify the economy away from its dependence on oil revenue, while sustaining the current economic growth trajectory.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Insists Nigeria better off united, optimistic nation will overcome challenges\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, said at the weekend in London that President Muhammadu Buhari was the only politician in Nigeria at this time with the charisma and credibility to rally the whole country behind the patriotic push to rise above its current challenges.\n\nOsinbajo stressed the need for Nigeria to remain an indivisible country, assuring that its challenges would soon be overcome.\n\nThe vice president spoke during an interactive session with top officials of the Nigerian High Commission in London.\n\nHe declared, \u201cIf you look at all of us sitting here, we represent all the geopolitical zones. This is the Nigeria that will succeed; anything else doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nDescribing Buhari\u2019s popularity and credibility as a crucial factor in galvanizing the entire system to resolve the challenges, Osinbajo said, \u201cThe president is possibly the most popular Nigerian politician that we ever had in generations. He is possibly the only person, who can go into a place or somewhere without bossing people to gather and they will come and listen to him speak.\n\n\u201cWe need that level of credibility to be able to solve problems in our country. And I think because of his level of credibility, despite everything, he is still the only one that can call everyone, and even people, who do not necessarily agree with him know that he is a man of his words.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo urged Nigerians at home and in the diaspora to promote the message of one country, noting, \u201cAnybody, who looks at how Nigeria operates will recognise that we are better off in this system, and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cYoruba are not better off on their own. Igbos are not better off on their own. The North is not better off on its own. We are better off as one nation, that is why we are strong and that is why we can face the world.\u201d\n\nFurther stressing the need for unity, he stated, \u201cIf you read of the economics of smaller nations, they are looking for how they can become stronger by aligning with other nations. How does a country with all the potential and everything that we have, think that the best way is to break up?\n\n\u201cWe are at a point in time in our history, where we have security challenges; we have economic challenges, and if you talk about security, there are so many dimensions to it. If you look carefully, all of these could happen to any government and I think we are in the very best position to solve the problems that face us today.\n\n\u201cSecurity challenges that we have didn\u2019t show up in one day but it is the government, the people, the men and women that will handle them.We happen to be that government, and I am very convinced that we are entirely capable of handling these challenges. I think we are in the best possible position to solve these problems.\u201d\n\nOsinbjo enjoined staff of the High Commission to remain good ambassadors of the country and endeavour to promote justice and fairness in their activities, even as they make more efforts to promote government\u2019s programmes and policies.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must promote one country. But, of course, everybody talks about justice, fairness and balance, and that is what we must try to do on a continuous basis.\n\n\u201cLet us not be discouraged, let us be very confident, because our country will come out of all these problems and emerge stronger. So, I urge every person, who represents our country, to ensure that we represent the country well and be able to speak up at the right forum about the country and what we are doing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Officials of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development have been accused of failing to distribute $100,000 (N41.1million) allowances donated by three banks to Nigeria\u2019s women basketball team for their Tokyo 2020 Olympic participation.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a member of the senior women basketball team, D\u2019Tigress, revealed that their allowances, bonuses, training grant worth $4,900 had also not been paid.\n\nShe added that none of the D\u2019Tigress team members would show up in camp in preparation for the February 2022 FIBA World Cup if the Nigerian government failed to pay them.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe last time we checked, some of our allowances, bonuses and training grants have not been paid. All our accounts numbers have been submitted but still no remittance. Donations made by banks for players, officials, volunteer stipends etc. dating all the way back to 2018 but I will let the managers address the vendor/contractor\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThey forget we all have a relationship and do communicate; $500 each 2018 FIBA World Cup for players and officials; $1,000 each for finishing final 8 in FIBA World Cup; $1,000 each bonus for winning AfroBasket in Senegal for 2019 players and officials.\n\n\u201c$300 - $400 each Mozambique Olympic Qualifier allowance balance, were supposed to be paid $100 per day; $2,000 each training grant balance from Tokyo Olympics, players only. The $100,000 donated by three Nigerian banks to all the players and officials that made D\u2019Tigress Olympics qualification possible final roster. The men also got $100,000 assigned to them, the total was $200,000.\n\n\u201cMiscellaneous expenses by players and officials; the full breakdown has been submitted to the outgoing Basket Ball President and the honourable minister, Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the association leadership, the Presidency, the Ministry and NBBF administration old and new, if these monies are not paid before the next qualifier of the next tournament in February 2022, FIBA World Cup, the entire D\u2019Tigress team will not show up in camp. We are all saying this as one unit and one voice.\u201d\n\nOn the poor outing of the team at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic, she said, \u201cWhoever watched the Olympics games and knows Nigerian Basketball could see that something was wrong. We didn\u2019t play our best because we weren\u2019t treated or given the best during one of the greatest stages and moments of an Athletes career.\n\n\u201cYes, we had some injuries, could have executed better but there were a lot of distractions around us like; Not knowing who we have available on the team.

          "text": "Officials of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development have been accused of failing to distribute $100,000 (N41.1million) allowances donated by three banks to Nigeria\u2019s women basketball team for their Tokyo 2020 Olympic participation.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a member of the senior women basketball team, D\u2019Tigress, revealed that their allowances, bonuses, training grant worth $4,900 had also not been paid.\n\nShe added that none of the D\u2019Tigress team members would show up in camp in preparation for the February 2022 FIBA World Cup if the Nigerian government failed to pay them.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe last time we checked, some of our allowances, bonuses and training grants have not been paid. All our accounts numbers have been submitted but still no remittance. Donations made by banks for players, officials, volunteer stipends etc. dating all the way back to 2018 but I will let the managers address the vendor/contractor\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThey forget we all have a relationship and do communicate; $500 each 2018 FIBA World Cup for players and officials; $1,000 each for finishing final 8 in FIBA World Cup; $1,000 each bonus for winning AfroBasket in Senegal for 2019 players and officials.\n\n\u201c$300 - $400 each Mozambique Olympic Qualifier allowance balance, were supposed to be paid $100 per day; $2,000 each training grant balance from Tokyo Olympics, players only. The $100,000 donated by three Nigerian banks to all the players and officials that made D\u2019Tigress Olympics qualification possible final roster. The men also got $100,000 assigned to them, the total was $200,000.\n\n\u201cMiscellaneous expenses by players and officials; the full breakdown has been submitted to the outgoing Basket Ball President and the honourable minister, Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the association leadership, the Presidency, the Ministry and NBBF administration old and new, if these monies are not paid before the next qualifier of the next tournament in February 2022, FIBA World Cup, the entire D\u2019Tigress team will not show up in camp. We are all saying this as one unit and one voice.\u201d\n\nOn the poor outing of the team at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic, she said, \u201cWhoever watched the Olympics games and knows Nigerian Basketball could see that something was wrong. We didn\u2019t play our best because we weren\u2019t treated or given the best during one of the greatest stages and moments of an Athletes career.\n\n\u201cYes, we had some injuries, could have executed better but there were a lot of distractions around us like; Not knowing who we have available on the team. Not having enough practice time with each other to build cohesiveness.\n\n\u201cOur head coach did not prioritize adequate preparation nor trust his staff enough to delegate significant responsibility.

          "text": "Some of the applicants for the 2020 8th Regular course of the Nigeria Police Academy have cried out over the injustice in the force in the process of selection of recruits.\n\nA number of candidates who spoke with SaharaReporters said they were forced to select the institution as their first choice while neglecting other higher institutions of learning thereby missing out on other opportunities.\n\nFile Photo\n\nAccording to the applicants, they were asked to resume without the list being released as is the usual practice of the Nigerian Police Academy.\n\nOne of them told SaharaReporters, \u201cThe Nigeria Police Academy kept her applicants waiting for admission since 2020 and in June 2021, they called applicants for screening which made some applicants miss the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.\n\n\u201cThey called about 4,000 people for screening and after wasting our time for one year, they made us miss opportunities of getting admission into other universities; they admitted just 600 people out of 4000.\n\n\u201cThe worst of it all is that they admitted people and they resumed without releasing any final list and also refused to follow the principle of federal character (selecting an equal amount of people from each state).\u201d\n\nAnother applicant stated, \u201cAs a requirement for admission into the Nigerian Police Academy, the academy made it clear that the UTME had to be taken by each aspirant and must have chosen NPA as their first choice of institution and score not less than 180 to be qualified for the entrance exams to the Nigerian Police Academy (NPA) / POLAC.\n\n\u201cCandidates seeking admission into the NPA after being successful in the JAMB UTME test must also apply via the academy portal (polac.edu.ng) paying the sum of N3,500 to purchase the online application form otherwise, the candidate will not be qualified. So many aspirants passed and made it to the Entrance Examination while others didn't, as usual.\n\n\u201cThe entrance examination took place after a very long time due to the outbreak of COVID-19, and after several postponements which made many aspirants shun other institutions, they should've applied, making some of them missing opportunities because of the belief that the NPA will admit many like that of Regular Course 7.\n\n\u201cCandidates took the exams and roughly 4,000 candidates were shortlisted, though not all candidates would be admitted; but this gave them high hope that many would be admitted. Unfortunately for them, a few were admitted and the academy still didn't release an official list on the website.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the remaining may still be having fake hopes because POLAC left them without a form of notification on the academy website. Moreover, the forms sold out by the NPA were over 10,000 and what was their reason for not limiting the form sales when they'll not admit up to a thousand?\u201d\n\nStill another candidate said, \u201cApart from that, NPA stated clearly the requirements an aspirant must meet before being admitted but some were absent in the screening exercise, some didn't make the cutoff mark and yet they get admitted because money was paid to the admission boards or they have someone they know who can secure an admission for them.\n\n\u201cAfter the screening exercise, which was postponed many times, later took place June/ July 2021, normally, the police academy usually posts on their website the list of the successful and admitted candidates a month after the screening exercise, but the RC8 candidates waited for roughly two months for the shortlist.\n\n\u201cLater, by rumours the candidates got to know that they could check admission via Jamb Caps. Meanwhile, the aspirants are still wondering why Jamb Caps? And there's still no official announcement/update on the academy website.\n\n\u201dAfter almost a month of the informal and unusual admission through the Jamb Caps of about 640 names, the whole admitted names were erased and not so long after the erasure of the Caps, the academy announced the resumption date for the unofficial Caps list and yet refused to publish the list officially on the website as what the aspirants consider official is always anything that appears on the website.\n\n\u201cAspirants should get answers to the following questions: 1.Why was the list not published through the usual channel? 2. If they knew that they weren\u2019t going to admit as many students as they did in RC7, they shouldn\u2019t have put on 4000 plus students for an interview where they would be selecting only 600. Why?\n\n\u201c3. And why wasn\u2019t there any form of information regarding the list they left us unattended to and the next thing we can see is resumption dates and now they\u2019ve resumed and still no official statement has been made on their website.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it so sad that corruption exists where corruption fighters are made.\u201d\n\nA candidate also lamented, \u201cThe applicants of the 8th regular course of the Nigeria Police Academy have been treated very unfairly. After series of postponements of the entrance exams and then the screening, a lot of inconveniences caused as many of us had to rebook our flights down to Kano (paying more money). Many had to travel by road despite the heavy insecurity, they took the risk.\n\n\u201cOver 3500 applicants were shortlisted for the screening. Unfortunately for batch 1, many of us missed our UTME as it clashed with the screening. They also refused to release a list of successful candidates like in previous years. They only released a resumption date on the portal. So the few who got admission via JAMB caps resumed.\n\n\u201cIt's even more painful because they didn't pick from each states equally as regards to the principle of federal character. I want it to be brought to the notice of the police service commission as well as the ministry of police affairs.\n\n\u201cThere's nothing on their portal concerning the admission except the resumption dates. Every aspirant knows not everyone would be admitted but they disrespected us and made our efforts futile, caused us pain, wasted our time and made the screening clash with this year UTME exams.\u201d\n\nOne of the aggrieved students continued, \u201cThere is injustice at police academy the applicants are not happy about it, the academy has refused to release an official list to show those admitted, rather they did it underground and during the admission process they admitted people that didn't even write the exams some of those admitted didn't even come for screening and when we went for screening we were asked to feed ourselves after paying transport fee from far and it is never done that way.\n\n\u201cThis admission is 2020 admission, not 2021 and many of us missed this year UTME because we were in the screening and the police haven't addressed the issue, we are dying in silence; this has affected many of us both in studies and mental health; some states had about 300 shortlisted but 26 were selected. We deserve to know what's happening at least.\"",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s oil production increased marginally in September to an average of 1.25 million barrels per day from 1.24 million the previous month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest data from the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) on the 2021 crude oil and condensate production report has shown.\n\nAccording to the report, the increase represented 0.8 percent from the August production figure \u2014 but still among the lowest since January 2021.\n\nThe production output is in contrast with the Reuters survey that oil output rose by 170,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy implication, the development would continue to affect the nation\u2019s crude exports and foreign earnings.\n\nOn Monday, vice-president Yemi Osinbajo said the country\u2019s low oil production affected earnings and revenue for the government as projected in the 2021 budget.\n\nSpeaking at the midterm retreat of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second tenure, Osinbajo said the various shutdowns in some of the wells contributed to low production and impacted revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRevenue, of course, improved despite oil production issues. Although much lower than projected revenue in the budget due to problems in oil production,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\n\u201cWe are producing less than our OPEC quota.\n\n\u201cShutdowns or shut-in in some of the wells, and the various problems of getting them back up have generally tended to reduce our oil revenue as you see in the GDP report.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreed to maintain its gradual monthly oil production increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Nigeria has been performing below the OPEC quota \u2014 from an average of 1.36 million barrels per day in January 2021 to 1.25 million b/d in September.\n\nAccording to the S&P Global Platts survey, Nigeria\u2019s low oil production was caused by damages along key crude grades.\n\nThe Forcados is in its third-month force majeure while Nembe Creek Trunk Line severely impaired exports of Bonny Light.\n\nIn August, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) declared force majeure on Forcados crude oil \u2014 one of Nigeria\u2019s main crude oil terminals, exporting an average of 240,000 barrels of crude oil daily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from DPR showed that crude oil production at Forcados terminal is recovering, rising from 2 million barrels in August to 4.7 million in September.\n\nOn the flip side, Bonny Light slumped from 5.1 million barrels in August to 3.3 million in September. The two terminals are doing below 6 million barrels as of January 2021.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brent crude oil futures, global oil benchmark, rose 0.17 percent to $83.82 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures increased 0.08 percent to $80.60 a barrel.",

          "title": "China\u2019s growing influence is transforming African tech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Orlander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOrlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Orlander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Orlander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI got a strange call that my dad slumped some years back. It was strange because my dad was the most interesting person ever. Master storyteller, healthy, ambitious, and optimistic. How did someone like that suddenly slump?\u201d\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson recounts what was the beginning of a heart-wrenching and unforgettable event in her life. It also became a major propellant for the startup she would found a few years later. But, let\u2019s dwell here a bit.\n\n\u201cThat day he slumped was the start of several long nights spent comforting and aiding my once-upon an agile father and hoping that this won\u2019t be the end. In 2018, he passed away. It was the saddest thing. The doctor would later tell us that he had diabetes and hypertension gone undiagnosed for so long. This was something a simple routine health test could have caught, I thought.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson, Healthtracka Founder Source: Supplied\n\nThe axiom \u201cprevention is better than cure\u201d is one that some say has lost its importance due to constant use. However, it still holds. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in the detection, curbing, and prevention of life-threatening health challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA publication on Promoting Cancer Early Diagnosis by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that just as early diagnosis creates a marked difference in the outcome of a victim\u2019s experience with cancer \u2014 making room for the provision of care at the earliest stage possible \u2014 the same holds for all diseases. In the long run, it saves costs and lives.\n\nBut how does one access early diagnosis in low-income countries like Nigeria, where inhabitants are exposed to hospitals with an insufficient number of doctors, long wait times, inadequate care, extremely short visits with medical personnel, and poor communication?\n\nQuestions like these ran through the mind of Dare-Johnson as she nursed the idea for Healthtracka, a healthtech startup decentralising laboratory testing in Africa by providing at-home tests and digital results.\n\nFrom her degree in Biochemistry from the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, to an internship at University College Hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Nigeria, and her father\u2019s death due to an undetected bodily ailment, Dare-Johnson had both theoretical and experiential knowledge of the importance of lab tests.\n\nBut it was not until 2020 that she threw herself entirely into working on the idea, with the COVID-19 pandemic being the final trigger.\n\n\u201cAt the point of my father\u2019s death, I knew I needed to do something about this non/late diagnosis of health issues in Africa. Most people still wait for an emergency before going in for any health tests. For some, it feels like a lot of stress to take a pause in their lives to go seek health testing. In 2020, during the pandemic, I jumped on the trigger to get up and fix these testing problems with the power of technology.\u201d\n\nThe idea felt even more feasible as she continued to brainstorm. With over a decade of work as a marketing executive in technology-based, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), eCommerce, and medical diagnostics companies, she knew it was something that she could handle. As for the technical angle, a call had to be made first.\n\nFounding Healthtracka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Amusan, Co-founder\n\nThat call was to Victor Amusan, UX Designer and Dare-Johnson\u2019s friend. It was in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, at a time most people wondered what the viral spread of the virus would mean for many Nigerians. And here was his friend, with an idea for a lab testing product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArmed with a degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Technology (FUTA), Akure, Southwest Nigeria and hungry for the next technical adventure, he and Dare-Johnson began work on Healthtracka.\n\nIn May 2021, after doing their due diligence, they launched a product that allows users to book laboratory tests. The phlebotomist comes to their homes or office to collect samples, the samples are then transported to any of the partner labs for analysis. Healthtracka users get the results in their mails, 24-48hours after sample collection. The tests available include full-body health checkups, cancer screening, and STD tests.\n\nThe startup operates an asset-light model. They partner with well-known private pathology laboratories that spearhead diagnostic testing in Nigeria. Their partner labs include vCare Diagnostics, Lancet Laboratories, and AFRIGLOBAL Medicare.\n\n\u201cOur primary mission at Healthtracka is to make health testing accessible to Africans. We launched in Lagos, Nigeria, and so far, we have seen the viability of this product. With word-of-mouth and customer reviews being a major marketing tool for us. And our primary source of revenue is commissions.\u201d\n\nA visit to the startup\u2019s website showed that the average pricing for a test is \u20a615,000 ($36.52). I wondered aloud how affordable this is for the average Nigerian, and Dare-Johnson says it\u2019s the lowest they arrived at after market research.\n\n\u201cI believe a person\u2019s health is of maximum priority. After our market research, taking into consideration the equipment it costs to carry out these tests, plus logistics, that\u2019s the lowest we could come to. All babies grow, right? We\u2019re still at our early stage, and what\u2019s top priority now is gaining traction; as we evolve with time, maybe we can afford to beat down pricing.\u201d\n\nThe startup\u2019s offering is similar to APEX Medical Labs in Malawi and MDaaS Global in Nigeria, which operate an eDiagnostic service. But, Dare-Johnson says that Healthtracka\u2019s offering is unique in many ways.\n\n\u201cOur approach is different as we offer on-demand, at-home testing online. Our phlebotomists are highly trained sample collectors and able to reach people wherever they are. The lab is coming to people\u2019s doorstep with Healthtracka. Currently, we haven\u2019t identified any direct competitors but collaborators, and we are focused on leveraging the existing infrastructure in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nRunning as an African female founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeoluwa Dare-Johnson\n\nFor most female founders in the tech space, getting funding is difficult compared to their male counterparts. In 2020, a Briter Bridges report revealed that African startups raised at least $1.3 billion in disclosed funding and female tech entrepreneurs raised only 20.1% \u2014 $261.3m \u2014 of the total investment recorded.\n\nBeyond the shores of Africa, this imbalance persists. Female founders have a harder time securing funding, even in the US, where it is believed that social progress exists. Some women-focused VC firms have launched to fill these gaps for female founders and underrepresented groups.\n\nIn 2020, FirstCheck Africa, a female-led, female-focused angel fund and investor community, launched as a medium to help African women quickly access funding. Dare-Johnson shares that they are one of her key investors and early backers.\n\n\u201cWe are venture-backed by amazing angel investors such as FirstCheck Africa as well as investments from family and friends. They launched around the time we were working on the idea, and I had my eyes fixed on them, knowing it was an encouragement and support I\u2019d need ahead of our launch.\u201d\n\nShe also shares that another challenge they\u2019ve faced is getting people to believe that at home health tests can be carried out.\n\n\u201cPeople found it hard to believe that lab tests can be done at home, especially in Nigeria, but because we were lucky to find our early adopters who basically jumped on the offer to test at the comfort of their homes, word and reviews began to spread like wildfire. And just recently we carried out our 1000th test.\u201d\n\nGoing forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthtracka team\n\nEvery startup founder wants their company to grow, eventually becoming a household name among locals, and Dare-Johnson is not exempt. For her, the most exciting part of the journey has been witnessing the massive potential of the business and being a part of the solution to the challenges in Africa\u2019s health sector.\n\n\u201cThe health tech industry in Africa is ripe for disruption and radical innovation. The problems are numerous; the onus lies on us to find these solutions that can scale with technology. It is really inspiring to see amazing health tech companies owning the spaces and fixing their slice of the problems.\u201d\n\nPlans for the future include growing, increasing user-base strength, and expanding across Africa. As part of this, the startup recently opened a branch in the Southwestern Nigerian city of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to reach Africans in every corner they are, not only Nigerians but the entire population in Africa. Africans abroad inclusive as well who still need to keep tabs on their family\u2019s health care. Healthtracka wants to bring the lab to your doorstep wherever you are.\u201d\n\nHealthcare is an essential part of life, and startups creating access in various ways are in demand. It would not be out of place to expect that with time, the healthtech sector will see more players digitising solutions to the problems Africa faces with the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there!\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nMono\u2019s Series A\n\nDigital gender gap\n\nAirtel Money\u2019s spend now and pay later service\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: In the Techpoint Digest for yesterday, October 10, 2021, we stated that \u201conly 10% of West African startups with a female co-founder have raised $1 million.\u201d which was somewhat misleading.\n\nA more accurate statement would be, \u201conly 10% of West African startups with a female co-founder raised over $1 million between 2010 and 2019\u201d, as it clearly states the timeframe for funding activities in Women-led startups. You can check out this piece for more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono announces $15m Series A to speed up growth in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMono Team\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, October 11, 2021, African fintech startup, Mono, announced a $15m Series A. This round follows a $2 million seed raised in May.\n\nAmerican investment firm Tiger Global led this round, with participation from SBI Investment, Target Global and General Catalyst, all first-time investors in Mono. Returning investors include Ingressive Capital, Entree Capital, Golden Palm Investment Corporation (GPIC), Lateral Capital, and Acuity VC.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Mono? Mono is a fintech API that serves as a source for financial data. They aggregate data like income, account statements, real-time balance, customer spending patterns, and historical transactions into a single API for financial firms and third-party developers.\n\nHold on a bit: A month after the startup launched, it raised a $500k pre-seed in September 2020, then a $2m seed in May 2021. This amounts to $17.5 million in funding disclosed so far. If funds raised in investment rounds connotes traction, then Mono seems to be growing. Although, in most cases, traction reflects more in user-base growth and revenue.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Mono\u2019s CEO Abdulhamid Hassan, former Product Manager at Paystack , shared that not only has Mono partnered with 270 businesses and developers in processing over 200 million financial data transactions, they have also seen a 45x year-on-year growth in connecting bank accounts and a 10x revenue increase since their pre-seed in May.\n\nCoupled with a recent expansion to Ghana and a planned foray into Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt, Hassan says that most of Mono\u2019s moves are primarily based on customers\u2019 requests, as they have built a reputation amongst customers. With this funding, they\u2019re looking to develop solutions for non-tech and traditional industries and establish a footprint in five African countries by next year.\n\nThis article provides some much-needed context on Mono and the growing sub-sector it\u2019s playing in: Why API-led fintech startups are becoming a big deal in Nigeria\n\nCountries lose $1 trillion from the digital gender gap in over a decade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in tech. Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://www.instagram.com/guzeartworld_photography/\u201d target=\u201d_ blank\u201d rel=\u201dnoopener noreferrer\u201d>Guzeartworld Photography</a>\n\nSurprise, surprise? Issues like gender imbalance in education, unequal pay, and the exclusion of women in economic activities and innovative processes seem to be over-flogged discussions, and by now, you\u2019d expect a rapid change in policies to address these gaps. Sadly that is not the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye-bye money: On Monday, October 11, 2021, the World Wide Web Foundation and Alliance for Affordable Internet(A4AI) released a report on the Economic Consequences of the Digital Gender Gap, and it was found that lower-middle-income countries have lost an estimated $1 trillion in GDP due to digital gender gap in over a decade.\n\nWhat is the digital gender gap? It is the aspect of the digital divide \u2014 the division of people into the connected and unconnected and disparity in access to technology \u2014 that exists as a result of gender differences. The report shows that globally, women are disproportionately excluded from the Internet, with 52% of men likely to be online than women.\n\nBut why does it exist? This gap exists for both intentional and unintended reasons, which include inequalities in education and digital skills, social norms that discourage women and girls from being online, privacy, safety, and security.\n\nFrom the 32 countries surveyed, one-third of women were connected to the Internet, translating into a $24 billion loss in tax revenue annually. To dig up these figures, the report reviewed 70% of the collective GDPs of these countries and paired it with existing data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). You can find the full report here.\n\nGoing forward: In a constantly evolving world, the need for digital inclusion is crucial, and we cannot build solid walls for the future if one part is left out. Early introduction and access to technology and digital innovation will make a world of difference.\n\nTanzanian Airtel Money users get extra spending power\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel Money users in Tanzania can now spend and pay later\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? On Monday, October 11, 2021, mobile money provider, Airtel Money, announced that via a partnership with I&M Bank, Tanzania, it had launched Kamilisha, a digital lending service that allows users to access overdrafts. Based on terms and conditions, of course.\n\nWith Kamilisha, customers with no funds in their wallet can buy airtime and data bundles, carry out person-to-person (P2P) transfers, make water and electricity bill payments to Dar es Salaam\u2019s Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA), and The Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO), and pay back later.\n\nHow it works: To access this service, users can dial the code *150*60#, select 0, click on fund my wallet, and activate Kamilisha for transactions by pressing 1. The technology behind this service is powered by YABX, an African-focused fintech startup that offers credit facilities.\n\nFun fact.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe underrepresentation of women in the tech space continues to be a prevalent phenomenon in most parts of the world. A 2020 study by AnitaB.Org shows that of all hires made by tech companies in the US, 29.4% were women, while 69.9% were men.\n\nCloser to home, Techpoint Africa\u2019s West African Startup Decade Report 2020 corroborates the story in the US. It estimates that between 2010 and 2019, only 10% of West African startups with a female co-founder raised over $1 million.\n\nIn Africa, the girl child\u2019s access to education is still quite low. According to UNESCO 52 million girls are out of school.\n\nWhile these might seem like just numbers, it encompasses the story of many women who perceive the tech space as one reserved just for men. In Yanmo Omorogbe\u2019s \u2014 Co-Founder, Bamboo \u2014 opinion, seeing more women do things in tech might encourage more women to come in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs male-dominated as the tech space is, however, some women are making their mark, serving as a source of encouragement for more women to dive in.\n\nTo celebrate this year\u2019s International Day for the Girl Child, Techpoint Africa spoke to four tech women about their work, life and how they\u2019re navigating a male-dominated ecosystem.\n\nMuthoni Masinde, Founder ITIKI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Muthoni Masinde, Founder, ITIKI\n\nThe idea behind Prof Muthoni Masinde\u2019s startup is rooted in the history of the Kenyan village where she grew up. Masinde transformed ancient knowledge into a technology that has been of immense help to her people.\n\nHer startup, ITIKI, was built from the understanding of nature that her people have gathered through many generations. They could predict, almost accurately, what the weather would be by observing the demeanour of their cattle and the unique croaks of a toad that said the rain was coming.\n\nShe combined this indigenous knowledge with tech to birth ITIKI. The startup created a drought prediction solution for small-scale farmers and has moved beyond predicting droughts to locust attacks.\n\nStarting in a Kenyan village\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProf. Muthoni Masinde, CEO of ITIKI. Source: Supplied\n\nMasinde\u2019s journey from peasant farmer in a remote Kenyan village to globally recognised academic and founder of a transformative agritech startup is an inspiring one.\n\nAlthough she describes her childhood as normal, she admits that looking back now, it was very hard. \u201cWhen you go to the city, and you look back, you realise those people are doing really difficult work.\u201d\n\nAt that time, education was a luxury for a female child growing up in Masinde\u2019s village. But luckily for her, she had a father that believed strongly in educating every child, regardless of gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe would tell beautiful stories of very tall buildings in Nairobi. Personally, he\u2019ll tell me, \u2018my daughter can become a doctor,\u2019\u201d Masinde said with an expression that was perhaps the same one she had while her father told her those stories back then.\n\nShe combined having an understanding father with hard work to make a name for herself. While her peers were getting married, Masinde says she doubled down on school, and it paid off.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t without its challenges.\n\n\u201cThere was no electricity, so we never really studied at home. In the village setting, girls get more chores than boys, so we\u2019ll be busy until bedtime. Sweeping, cooking, or depending on the season, you either help with weeding or harvesting. Extremely busy life, but I think we enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nMaking it through school\n\nMasinde says she owes some of her academic success to being gifted. With few comprehension problems, she excelled at her favourite subjects like maths, physics, and chemistry.\n\nShe recalls a moment that inspired her greatly. \u201cI remember when my mom escorted me to school, carrying those big iron boxes. She told me, \u2018my daughter, the best gift you can give to us is working hard.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd that stuck with Masinde through high school and university, even to founding her startup.\n\nBuilding ITIKI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall-scale farmers using ITIKI solution. Source: Supplied\n\nPursuing a career in tech as a woman can be tricky. While Masinde admits things were easy for her, there were a few times she felt marginalised as a female, especially at the hands of male farmers while trying to explain her technology.\n\n\u201cThe more educated people are, the less likely they\u2019re going to look down on people. Every time we went to speak to the farmers, addressing men as old as your dad, they don\u2019t listen because they are not used to women being the ones up there.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, culture plays a role in why tech and other major sectors have fewer women. From a tender age, girls are fed with information that makes them believe some dreams are only meant for a specific gender.\n\nA situation that leaves women at a disadvantage. She says women also need to be given equal chances as men, as most structures that are currently in place only favour men.\n\nTo women, Masinde says that for every tech opportunity that comes along, \u201cgo for it!\u201d\n\nYanmo Omorogbe, Co-Founder and COO, Bamboo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYanmo Omorogbe, Co-Founder and COO, Bamboo\n\nGrowing up in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria, Osayanmo Omorogbe never had the intention of being an entrepreneur, let alone building a startup. And although she describes the journey towards building fintech startup, Bamboo, as a series of lucky stumbles, she was well equipped to make the best of them.\n\nFrom school days to finding tech\n\nAn ardent fan of the American soap opera Days of Our Lives, she always spared time from schooling activities to watch her favourite show.\n\nShe was fond of school and is still close to some of her best friends from Grange Schools, Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAlthough she runs a fintech firm currently, she never had any interest in tech during her formative years.\n\n\u201cI was a Nigerian child that liked math and chemistry. I wanted to be a chemical engineer and work in Shell or something.\u201d\n\nHer \u201clucky stumbles\u201d into tech and finance began when she studied Chemical Engineering and discovered she didn\u2019t like it.\n\nThis led to an interest in finance and working with a private equity firm in Lagos. She learned more about finance and investing and even became a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) holder \u2014 a professional designation considered the gold standard for financial analysts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith her knowledge of finance and investing, she tried to get shares in companies like Apple and Google. But she couldn\u2019t. This difficulty birthed Bamboo; a means for Nigerians to invest in foreign stocks from the comfort of their phones.\n\nOmorogbe grew up knowing she could pursue any career. Having a mother who was a law professor and a grandmother who was one of West Africa\u2019s first female doctors, she needed no further reassurance that she was capable of anything.\n\n\u201cThere just wasn\u2019t any room for me to assume that women couldn\u2019t do whatever they wanted. \u201d\n\nIn contrast with this belief, she encountered people who felt some of her aspirations or career choices were reserved for men.\n\n\u201cI remember when I first said I wanted to study engineering, some random person was like, \u2018aren\u2019t engineers boys?\u2019 And I remember telling my dad, and it made absolutely no sense to him.\u201d\n\nAs the Co-Founder and COO of Bamboo, she faced this once again.\n\nNavigating the tech space\n\n\u201cI was talking to a would-be investor, and he was asking things along the lines of, \u2018Am I getting married soon? Am I thinking about having children soon? Because he won\u2019t invest in any business with a newlywed lady.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told someone I\u2019m running a fintech, and they were shocked that I\u2019m not into fashion.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s surrounded by women that continue to inspire her, from her sister, who\u2019s also her best friend, to her friends and family.\n\nFor those unlucky in finding a tight circle of fearless women who defy societal constructs, Omorogbe believes society has to make the tech space more comfortable for women.\n\n\u201cAs a society, we need to make it easier for women to become founders, to enter tech, to start learning to code, or know what other opportunities are available.\n\n\u201cSpaces need to be safer for women. Women are over mentored and underfunded. They don\u2019t need another seminar; give them a check.\u201d\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, YouTube and YouTube Music (sub-Saharan Africa)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, YouTube and YouTube Music\n\nAddy Awofisayo\u2019s role as YouTube\u2019s Head of Music for sub-Saharan Africa is a perfect fit for her. Growing up, she had a flair for the arts, loving nothing better than storytelling.\n\nFrom finance to tech\n\nI could tell she was good at it by how she narrated the story behind the name Addy. It was coined by someone she met while at the University of Virginia, Virginia, US, from her original name, Adeola.\n\nHowever, despite her love for all things creative, she pursued a career in finance because \u201cthe smart people were doing accounting and finance, and I thought let me do accounting and finance,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\nShe thrived in finance nonetheless, taking up jobs at renowned organisations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and Goldman Sachs. But, \u201cI hated it. I was like, \u2018this is not for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAwofisayo wasn\u2019t enjoying the finance life, but all the smart people were doing, and she wanted to be part of the \u201csmart\u201d people.\n\n\u201cI realised I didn\u2019t want to do investment banking, and I didn\u2019t want to do public accounting. So if I still want to do this accounting and finance career, what do I do?\u201d\n\nHer question was answered by a fellow alumnus who was the CFO of the Windows division at Microsoft. He introduced her to building a career in finance in tech companies, and she welcomed the idea.\n\n\u201cI applied and got into the finance rotation program at Microsoft.\u201d And her tech career began.\n\nBut growing up, Awofisayo didn\u2019t like tech. \u201cIn high school, I thought all the science students were geeks and nerds. I always thought, to be in tech, you needed to be a science person, be good in computer science, and that just wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nAlthough she found it odd combining finance and tech, she thought it was worth a try.\n\n\u201cOnce I started at Microsoft, I truly enjoyed it. It was very different from my Goldman Sachs and my public accounting experience that was very corporate.\u201d\n\nShe immediately fell in love with the tech culture. \u201cWhen I went for my interview at Microsoft, I wore a suit, and the person that was interviewing me had on jeans and a t-shirt. And I was like, am I at the right place?\u201d\n\nIt was then Awofisayo realised she had a knack for the tech life.\n\nAlthough the space was male-dominated, Awofisayo never felt intimidated. Like Omorogbe, she grew up knowing she could do whatever she wanted.\n\n\u201cMy mom is one of the strongest women I know, she spent a lot of her years championing her career, so I had that as a role model to let me know I could do whatever it was I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAnd she did. After combining tech with finance, she pivoted to tech and creativity, something she has always had a passion for. She has worked with some of Africa\u2019s biggest music artists and creatives, and she\u2019s even more excited about the upcoming ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo presenting silver play award to afrobeat artiste D\u2019banj. Source: Pulse.ng\n\n\u201cThe African music space is blowing up. Whether it\u2019s from songs like Essence or Nwatiti, it\u2019s not even your Wizkids and Burnas and Davids anymore. It\u2019s Temz, Ckay, Omah Lay. It\u2019s the next voice and the next generation that\u2019ll really take African music to the next level.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo (left) andNaira Marley. Source: This Day\n\nAnd to women planning on venturing into the tech space, Awofisayo says, \u201cBe curious, chase that curiosity, seek out people, and don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\n\nIre Aderinokun, Co-Founder and COO, Helicarrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIre Aderinokun, Co-Founder Helicarrier (Buycoins)\n\nHelicarrier (formally Buycoins) Co-Founder, Ire Aderinokun, was always drawn to tech growing up. She usually played with her parents\u2019 phones and really enjoyed gaming, attributes she says fostered her love for tech.\n\nThe road to tech\n\nSurprisingly, she didn\u2019t study a tech-related course in school.\n\n\u201cI was doing it as a hobby as a teenager. It was kind of on and off, and I didn\u2019t really know about computer science as a degree, so I ended up studying psychology for my undergraduate, and I did law for my masters.\u201d\n\nShe felt the boat to learning tech formerly had sailed, so she started learning independently and gave herself a year to see if she could forge a career out of learning coding on her own.\n\nStarting as a freelancer, she took on gigs but quickly found it frustrating, so the job hunt began.\n\nShe worked for a small web design company before moving to Big Cabal Media, where she met one of her co-founders \u2014 Timi Ajiboye \u2014 and they started building Helicarrier accidentally.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a backend developer. I\u2019m a front-end developer. So it just made sense to do a bunch of stuff together.\u201d\n\nHelicarrier started as one of their side projects. \u201cFor me, I wasn\u2019t necessarily thinking of it like, this was going to be our company. It was just like this is a really interesting project to work on.\u201d\n\nThey put months of work into the project and eventually launched it as a company. But it still seemed like a side project until Y Combinator came calling, and they realised things were getting real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were all just working out of Timi\u2019s house. I\u2019ll just stroll in whenever. But when we had to actually fly to the US to do the interview with YC, that\u2019s the point we knew; this is something we\u2019re taking seriously.\u201d\n\nCreating tech opportunities for women\n\nAlthough she didn\u2019t face pushbacks as a woman in tech, she\u2019s actively creating opportunities for women to get into tech.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, I got a bit tired of being the only woman wherever I went. It didn\u2019t really make sense cause I know there were plenty of women who are very interested in tech and are very capable, but we don\u2019t have access to some things.\u201d\n\nAderinokun is creating that access with her scholarship program that gives women free access to Udemy courses that\u2019ll help them advance their career in tech.\n\n\u201cI have the money to give scholarships and fund some people, so why not just try and do it. And it has grown over the years, and I hope it\u2019ll continue to grow.\u201d\n\nThrough the scholarship, she has seen females enter the tech space. One of the beneficiaries currently works with Aderiokun to run the programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Monday met with relevant stakeholders to review the government\u2019s strategies at improving security and stemming herders-farmers crisis in the state.\n\nThe governor, at a stakeholders\u2019 town hall meeting on a proposed Anti-Open Grazing Law for Edo State, said the delay in the signing of the law is to ensure the crafting of an implementable law that will put an end to the growing insecurity and economic challenges in the state.\n\nStakeholders at the event were drawn from different walks of life, including traditional rulers, youth groups, religious bodies and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), among others.\n\nAccording to Obaseki, \u201cWe are one of the few states that are yet to sign the anti-open grazing law, and the reason is simple; it doesn\u2019t make sense to put out a law you cannot enforce.\n\n\u201cThe best way of enforcing a law is to bring everybody together to be part of that law. We have a crisis in our country, it is deeply rooted; there are different causes. Let us go to the root of the causes and resolve it from there.\n\n\u201cPeople have said that we have lived a hundred years together in harmony before now. Why are we having these problems today?\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cIf we don\u2019t go to the reason, then we will be scratching the surface. Let us start by understanding why we are having this challenge. The anti-grazing law, in my view, is to deal with some perceptions. I want to tell you that this is not an issue between Christians and Muslims; it is not an issue between North and South, and it is not an issue between Edo and Fulani people.\n\n\u201cAs long as we have decided that we will eat meat and drink milk, we will have to sit down and rearrange the business, engaging the people who are producing these foods on how they must organize themselves.\u201d\n\nObaseki further urged, \u201cLet us not play politics with this issue; let us deal with it honestly and openly. There are security implications because some people have now joined and are using these herders to perpetuate insecurity.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that if we don\u2019t separate them so that we can know those people who are using cattle herding to perpetrate crime and insecurity in our state, we will be missing the point.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are doing their legitimate business of herding cattle and producing meat, and there are criminals who want to destabilise our country and state.\u201d\n\nRepresentative of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Edo State Chapter, Rev. Oriakhi Davies, said cattle rearing is a private business and anybody interested in the business should acquire land for such business.\n\nDavies suggested ranching as an alternative for open grazing.\n\nChairman, Cattle Dealers Association, Edo State, Alhaji Saad Ahmed, said about forty-five percent of cows consumed in Benin comes directly from the North.\n\nHe appealed to the governor to treat everybody equally, irrespective of their religion and beliefs, saying that God has blessed Edo and his people have been living in the state without any trouble.\n\n...",

          "text": "Out of the more than 206,000 mobile malware attacks blocked by Kaspersky solutions for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa (META) region in just six months measured between January and June 2021, over 30,000 of these attacks combined originated from Nigeria (14,071), Kenya (10,697), and South Africa (5,499).\n\nSignificantly, for African countries monitored, Nigeria only trails Egypt (19,466) by the number of attacks blocked, pointing to how prevalent mobile threats have become in this highly connected country. In fact, Kaspersky\u2019s latest research shows that when looking at the top ten countries by share of users attacked by mobile malware Nigeria places eighth (at 11.76 per cent). Even though Kenya and South Africa might not feature as prominently, the mobile malware threat is still a concern, along with the shift to more targeted based attacks these countries are seeing.\n\nThe top three most prevalent malware behaviours that Kaspersky has seen in Kenya and Nigeria are Trojans, Trojan-Downloaders; and Trojan-Droppers. In South Africa, these are Trojans, Trojan-Proxy; and Trojan-Downloaders.\n\nA Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software which attackers can use to try and gain access to user systems. As the name suggests, Trojan-Downloaders download and install new versions of malicious programmes, including Trojans and Adware on victim computers. Meanwhile, Trojan-Droppers usually save a range of files containing malicious programmes to the victim\u2019s drive. Once installed, a Trojan-Proxy allows an attacker to use the infected device as a proxy to connect to the Internet.\n\n\u201cMobile malware remains a significant threat for corporate and personal users across Africa. These attacks are usually very diverse with hackers leveraging a range of methodologies and technologies to compromise victim\u2019s devices. Trojan-Downloaders and Trojan-Droppers are especially dangerous given their potential to contain significantly damaging payloads,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa.\n\nIn addition to installing cybersecurity solutions on their mobile devices, like Kaspersky Total Security, here are a few additional ways users can enhance their security:\n\nCreate a strong password. By putting a strong password on their smartphone, the device can become unusable if it is lost or stolen and the password attempt fails a certain number of times. Do not trust SMS. Mobile malware uses text messages, so users should never respond to requests for credit card details or other private information. Check your browser for the lock symbol. The lock icon in the address bar indicates that the sight is secure when entering personal data.\n\n\n\nInstall apps from reputable sources.

We must recognise the strong linkages between security, investment, growth, and development,\u201d said Mr Adesina. \u201cThat is why the African Development Bank is working on developing Security-Indexed Investment Bonds to help African countries and Regional Economic Communities to mobilise resources to tackle these challenges.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the AfDB boss stressed the importance of the modernisation and transformation of ports in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPorts are not there for revenue generation. They are for facilitating business and exports, and stimulating industrial manufacturing, and competitiveness of local businesses and exports,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe should not be decongesting the ports in Nigeria; we should be transforming the ports. This must start with cleaning up administrative bottlenecks, most of which are unnecessary with multiple government agencies at the ports, high transaction costs or even plain extortions from illegal taxes, which do not go into the coffers of the government.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the trade, investment, and competitiveness through the Africa Continental Free Trade Area was a major opportunity for Nigeria, which would depend on its ports.\n\n\u201cNigeria should also move rapidly to the top of selected value chains, such as automobiles, computers and electronics, textile and garments, and food manufacturing, transport, and logistics,\u201d said Mr Adesina",

          "text": "A human right organisation, Save the Children International, has said that child marriage kills over 60 girls daily.\n\nThe organisation quoting a report said it had been estimated that 44 per cent of girls in Nigeria get married before their 18th birthday, one of the highest rate of child marriage globally.\n\nThe organisation said these in a statement issued on Monday night and signed by its Chief Executive, Inger Ashing, in commemoration of the 2021 International Day of the Girl Child.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cRates are not likely to decrease today as Nigerian girls are living in one of the most difficult times.\n\n\u201cAs a result of armed conflict, humanitarian crisis, kidnapping, natural disaster, displacement, COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession, the lives of millions of girls are threatened to be pushed into the basket of deprivation, including reduced access to education, nutrition, lack of protection and lack of access to basic social services, the State of Nigerian Girls Report showed.\n\n\u201cMore than an estimated 22,000 girls die per year from pregnancy and childbirth resulting from child marriage, new analysis from Save the Children released on International Day of the Girl reveals.\n\n\u201cWith the highest rate of child marriage in the world, West and Central Africa accounts for nearly half (9,600) of all estimated child marriage-related deaths globally, or 26 deaths a day.\n\n\u201cThe regional teenage maternal mortality rate is four times higher than anywhere else in the world.\n\n\u201cSouth Asia sees 2,000 child marriage-related deaths every year (or six every day), followed by East Asia and the Pacific with 650 deaths (or two every day), and Latin American and the Caribbean, with 560 annual deaths (or nearly two a day).\n\n\u201cAlthough nearly 80 million child marriages globally have been prevented in the last 25 years, progress had stalled even before the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which has only worsened inequalities that drive child marriage.\n\n\u201cWith school closures, health services under strain or closed, and more families being pushed into poverty, women and girls face an increased risk of violence during lengthy lockdowns.

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State is involved in a conflict over Bisi Fayemi, Governor Kayode Fayemi\u2019s wife, imposing a candidate for the 2022 governorship race.\n\nMrs Fayemi, according to several party members who spoke to SaharaReporters, was supporting the Secretary to the State Government, Biodun Oyebanji, despite the Governor\u2019s wishes.\n\nThey advised the First Lady not to impose Oyebanji on the party, saying her husband was willing to embrace equality by selecting someone from the Ekiti-South Senatorial District for the governorship ticket.\n\n\u201cThe First Lady may end up losing her respect should she work against attempt by APC to zone the governorship ticket to Ekiti South. All party leaders including the Governor are gradually empathising and embracing zoning with the exception of Mrs Fayemi, who still believed that APC has no zoning in its constitution,\u201d an APC member told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should counsel her to have a retrospect of how her husband became the governorship candidate of the Action Congress in 2007; Fayemi clinching the ticket then was accomplished on the strength of zoning and the next political dispensation won\u2019t be an exemption for the present agitations for zoning and what was obtainable then are similar.\u201d\n\nAnother party member, Victor Omogbemile said, \u201cWe learnt from good authority that Governor Kayode Fayemi, the Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo and Senator Dayo Adeyeye had silently agreed that the South should produce the next governor.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership at the national under Governor Mai Mala Buni, is aware of the fact that the next governor in Ekiti should emerge via zoning modality. Having a reminiscence of what transpired in 2007, the people of the North made agitations on the basis that the two democratically elected governors before then, Otunba Niyi Adebayo and Ayodele Fayose were from the Central and they believed that other zones should be given the opportunity.\n\n\u201cOur conclusion is that, it stabs logic on its head for Mrs Fayemi to now be resisting the same system that brought the respect she enjoys.\u201d\n\nOmogbemile who is the convener of Ekiti Youths for Equity alleged that Mrs Fayemi poking her nose into issues of politics had made some party members to believe she was only trying to pay back Oyebanji for being a good boy whose office was being used as a conduit pipe to siphon monies running into millions since 2018.\n\n\u201cMrs Fayemi must dispel this rumour by allowing the party to pick whoever they deem suitable for the ticket, particularly allowing a candidate from the South to emerge for her to keep her respect and honour,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Doctors said I won\u2019t live beyond 35, but here I am healthy at 70 \u2013 Dokpesi",
          "text": "Dr. Raymond Anthony Aleogho Dokpesi is a Nigerian media entrepreneur and Founder/Chairman Emeritus Ray Power/ Daar Communications. Ahead of his 70-year anniversary October 25, the trained marine engineer shares the touching story of his life with ABDULRAHMAN A. ABDULRAUF and a few other journalists recently in Abuja. The media owner who couldn\u2019t speak in the early years of his life was already \u2018sentenced\u2019 to death by doctors who declared he won\u2019t make it beyond 35 years.\n\nYour lowest and highest moments\n\nI thank you so much for this interaction which is preparatory to my 70th birthday in the next couple of days. But responding to your question on what has been my lowest and highest moments in my life, my lowest moment in recent time has been my prison arrest, trial and the alleged looting of treasury by this administration that led to my attention in the EFCC and at Kuje Prison. I think that has been the most remarkable and the most painful time in recent time.\n\nFor the high moment, my best moment, the moment of my joy was December 15, 1993 when Ray Power came on air. But in between , there had been quite some low and high moments, but the highest was during the commencement of test transmission of Ray Power.\n\nYou were given a chance to survive for only three years, but here you are at 70. How would you describe this?\n\nWell, let me say 35 was the benchmark that was given. The very early years I was very sickly. As I was growing up, I do recall very vividly sitting down always by the side of my father in Ibadan. Every evening, he would put his relaxing chair, his friends would come to pay him visits. Then, I was very handicapped because I could not talk from the very beginning of my life and very many people assumed because I could not talk or I could not hear or understand what it was. So, I would normally just watch, look and see things as they happened.\n\nI vividly recall when one of my father\u2019s very close friends, came to intervene about my schooling and he out rightly condemned any effort to invest in me. \u2018Look at him, he is very sickly. Secondly, he said \u2018do you see any child of a northerner succeed, apart from the goro (kolanut) they eat , they are never do- well. I was handicapped, and that was toughest moment of my life. At that time, I felt highly discriminated against, I felt I was likely to be denied the opportunity to live.\n\nMy mother was very helpless at that time, and here I was feeling very sick, not being able to communicate freely. And my mother too was an illiterate. So, here I was, I couldn\u2019t talk and even when I attempted to write anything, she could not read what I was writing. I think it was a lot of God\u2019s intervention after going through the University College Hospital Ibadan, treatment, diagnosis, operation that I started gradually better and talking.\n\nAnd by the time I was getting to about 12, 13, I was terribly sick. My mother, my father were taking me from hospitals, native doctors , herbalists, looking to churches, praying and looking for opportunity to survive. And here I was, the doctors, because they couldn\u2019t identify anything. I had to leave seminary for Loyaola College Ibadan. This case was very bad, it\u2019s better he goes back to his parents, he either survives there or dies , but let him not die here.\n\nSo, I went back to Benin, and in Benin too, my parents struggled and struggled, I could see their pains, I could see the struggle of my mother and the determination of my father at that time, I almost started believing it was best for me to die. I saw the pains they were going through, I saw the amount of love and struggle they were putting in to make sure that I was able to survive. And as God would do it, they later took me to Agenegbode, I think that was 1965/66 when my father had almost given up hope I was going to survive. We went through the bank of River Niger which was full at that time. We went into a small village, having travelled almost two and a half hours on the River, they called the village Osuneme. I was not given any injection. The people just came up to say I had been poisoned and people that committed the atrocity were there present.\n\nSo, \u2018here is water, if you are sure you are not the one responsible for the state of the health of this boy, and say God, you have seen me.\u2019 And one after the other, my father\u2019s eldest sister, my father\u2019s first wife, the lineage coincidentally were involved. I went into feat again where I was rolling and I vomited out. It was the same water that they were given that was given t me. So I took that same water and vomited quite extensively, different types of items from my abdomen, and that became the beginning of my revival until I got to Poland again in 1969.\n\nWhen I got to Poland, after doing the medical examinations that we\u2019ll get into university. They said I was not going to leave beyond the age of 35. So, I collected the results and forwarded to my father who kept on telling me I should have faith and confidence. One, it\u2019s God that created me and God has a defined mission for me, and that he was very sure and optimistic that if I went through all those challenges in my early life and I was able to survive and live up to this time, it\u2019s certain that I would live older than his father, acknowledged to be the oldest person in Agengbode, having died at the age of 120 in their estimation. Whether that is correct, I wouldn\u2019t know. But I do know he died in 1957, I was still a small kid. He swore I was going to live longer than him( his father) and added the fact that not the doctor nor anybody is my father, he is my father and is comforted that I will live long, and that I should just take care of myself.\n\nSo, as 35 was approaching , I was healthy but something had been planted into my system that you may be right or wrong, maybe it\u2019s going to be 35 years. From age 30-35, I enjoyed my life maximally, I had no holds barred. I said look, if I do not go beyond this bar, when I get back and God asks me \u2018how was it\u2019 I will say the last five years were very good. But behold, here I am seventy years old and I am strong and healthy. I thank Almighty God and all Nigerians that have given me support. I am healthy.\n\n..So you are a covenant child?\n\nCall me anything you want to call me. But let me say here that my eldest sister, Mrs Julian Angbagu, in the course of my battle with life, decided to make a pledge to God that if this boy survives all these, we will dedicate him to the service of Almighty God. That\u2019s why I got to the seminary, because she wanted to show appreciation and gratitude to God.\n\nBut my mother, having produced 13 children and I, the only surviving son at that time, in the middle, until we are now seven because some of them died. I am the only surviving child among all the seven of us. I am directly in the middle, so I am tied by the cord of those ahead of me and those before me. Say, covenant child, yes I am.\n\nWhat was running through your mind at that age 35 your life was expected to end?\n\nI counted it as a day when I was to see the end of my life. But I was very happy and joyous that I crossed the hurdle of this imaginary 35 years I was afraid of. I was Chief of Staff at a PhD. I was a multimillionaire, I was fulfilled, I was happy in life. So,I said, all these things happening were not happening for no reasons. Possibly, that 35 years was why God so ordered my life as smooth sailing as it was up to that 35 years. But the next 35 years, were even more joyous. I enjoyed my birthday and had all my friends, King Sunny Ade played and everybody celebrated. It was nice.\n\nCould that be the reason you are a polygamist?\n\nNo, that\u2019s not the reason. I am Catholic and I definitely will tell you that one of the greatest errors of my life is polygamy. But it was not something that I desired or something I wanted, but it\u2019s a situation that developed and I just had no alternative. A lot of people look at it and say oh, \u2018maybe it was wealth that distorted his behavior.\u2019 But the truth of the matter is that there were internal family challenges that led to this . I was married to a Polish woman, I wanted to remain with the Polish woman. But she left Nigeria for reason that she was the only child of her parent also, she had to stay with them. I had to stay here and that there is no leave in marriage. I shuttled down to Poland over 16 times requesting her to come back to Nigeria and stay. But she needed to, as the only child of her parents, be by them. But my mother was very anxious to have children of my own, that I don\u2019t have to enter place to go and visit. That explains the instability that later affected my life.\n\nAssessing our marine industry and nation\u2019s economy\n\nLet me say that I came back to Nigeria in 1976 December and started work effectively in 1977. I worked first under Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife at the Federal Ministry of Transport. He would attest to the fact that I was full of enthusiasm, full of patriotism, full hopes that Nigeria would become that prosperous and flowing with honey. When I came on a visit to Nigeria in 1975, Nigeria was either at same level of development with Poland, Sigapore and Taiwan and with the ports I visited in the course of my maritime training, it was also a beauty coming to Lagos Ports. True, we had congestion in 1975, true the country was undergoing rapid development-physical and industrial development at that time. But unfortunately, the Gowon era developed first national development plan, second national development plan and third national development plan. They were visions of wise men who wanted and meant well for the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But after that, everything derailed!\n\nThere was no basis of measuring the standard of people that took over the leadership of Nigeria. I will tell you for sure that I was keeping files of civil servants and ministers between 1951 and 75 that got burnt in my house. If you see the brilliance , patriotism and commitment, you will want to serve this country for life. But unfortunately, the federal character laws that came in brought in a lot of inexperienced people, mediocre were brought in and excellence sacrificed. It was sentiment.\n\nAt the Federal Ministry of Transport, I can tell you for free of charge that the Nigeria Ports Authority wanted to build an ocean terminal in Lagos towards Badagry and the other end. For political reasons, it was decided that we should on. For political reasons, we decided to build a port in Warri. Chief Obafemi Awolowo promised a port in Warri to satisfy the Itshekiris, Alhaji Sheu Shagari came in 1979 and said we should build a port in Sapele because of Urhobos. There was no economic reason. The ocean terminal that was to be built was looking at the type of vessels that would be in operation at about this time, which were all over the world. There was transition that time from general cargo movement to containerized cargo. Therefore, we were expecting development and enhancement in that direction.\n\nRivers state made it possible for President Sheu Shagari to win the 1979 election-the last votes that came in from the current Rivers and Bayelsa. So, in other to appreciate them, he shelved the idea of ocean terminal. Today, republic of Benin Port, Ivory Coast Port, all of them are now in better position because they are directly at the depth end . The basis of our decision making became emotional. I even hear a naval base is being built in Kano or Kaduna. Does that indicate there is unity in the country? That \u2018s how a lot of decisions made nonsense of our vision. The vision that was expected, we lost it.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear basis. Just that I feel that I need to create something for my people. Nobody is examining it properly. There are mineral resources in all parts of this country, so let us develop these mineral resources to a level that is economically viable. Nobody! That is what we are suffering.\n\nWay out\n\nIt boils down to both leadership and followership. I believe we have to restructure Nigeria effectively. You like it, you hate the word restructure, I believe it is the first thing we need to do to move ahead. So, you look for a leader who believes in restructuring and reorganising Nigeria, in moving Nigeria from oil-based economy to a diversification-based economy. We need somebody that believes that creating jobs does not mean taking people who have finished schools, whether qualified or unqualified, into the civil service. It is production that can bring about the development of the economy. There must be industries. The same people who closed down Ajaokuta rolling Mill are running around borrowing money today to build railway lines. Shagari saw this problem way back in 1979 and embarked on the development of Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Mill, development of Delta Steel Rolling , development of Katsina Steel Rolling Mill. In practical terms, Ajaokuta remained the only rolling mill which was supposed to remain the backbone of our industrial development.\n\nAnd Ajaokuta, by the time it was supposed to start production, was when the 1983 coup took place. Alhaji Mamman Makele was described as being corrupt and a thief, he ran for his dear life, he ran to the UK, he died in the UK, having succeeded not being crated back to Nigeria. In poverty, Mr Paul Unongo who was minister of state, suffered trauma,went through frustration, interrogation and so on. The easy clich\u00e9 to destroy anybody in Nigeria is that he is corrupt.\n\nFor that reason, Ajaokuta that remained $500million to complete it and start production, all the steel required for our rail lines, standard gauge and so on which had been planned was supposed to cost the entire country, to connect every village in the Federal Republic of Nigeria was supposed to cost N30billion. And Shagari at the Federal Executive Council meeting said we should fund it from the treasury , we should not go borrowing. We finished Ajaokuta, at that time we were using wood, but it could have also being metal on the ground to put the rail on.\n\nWe would have generated employment, created opportunities for Nigerians . No country will come to develop Nigeria. Nigerians must develop Nigeria, Nigerians must be given the opportunity to partake and participate in formulating policies. We have trained people but we don\u2019t believe in ourselves, we don\u2019t respect ourselves as people.\n\nYou were chief of staff in Gongola state as an indigene of Bendel state . Why is it not possible today?\n\nBad leadership, completely bad leadership! When these issues come in, people run away from reality. It is not the Fulani man that is bad. Sheu Shagari was a Fulani man who served Nigeria, in my opinion, very meritoriously, very conscientiously. We have had military heads of state that are northerners . But they were visionary, they were ready to accommodate others, they put together the best brains that were available for development and they gave them opportunities. So, milestones were achieved.\n\nI remember my uncle, Chief John Imoru who was a mayor in Port Harcourt, from Agenegbode . Even in Lagos and Enugu, there were northerners who contested and Yorubas who contested and won. People were living freely in Kano, I believe. Bayo Bodunrin(an AIT staff member ) was one of them. When we were growing up, it was unity , it didn\u2019t matter. The whole idea was that it is a country that was going to be flowing with milk and honey. But all of a sudden, when you have religious extremists, people who exploit the very thin lines of unity, then you find yourselves here. That is why I strongly believe there are still Nigerians who believe in one united Nigeria. There are still Nigerians who appreciate the value of what Nigeria is supposed to be, and those Nigerians must come out, most of these younger generation people that I am seeing. People that are clamoring for disintegration of the country and so on, I sympathise with them , I am sorry for them. But I feel very strongly that they are in that position because of the injustice that is going on in the country, because of different laws operating for different parts of the country.\n\nA lot of the states are not economically viable, they can\u2019t sustain themselves. For how long can we sustain these unsustainable states? They need to merge together, and people say no, how will this state go? But you can\u2019t fund it! You can\u2019t sustain it! In very simple terms, the job that used to be done in the northern region, are being done now by 19 permanent secretaries\u2019 ministry of education both inefficiently and ineffectively. The jobs that used to be done by just one person in the eastern region( including Rivers and Cross Rivers), is being done by 7 persons with different approaches. It has not helped our development. So, we must sit down and say if we want to move ahead, we must reduce our administrative and consumption cost, we must give attention to development. Today, over 70-80% of the monies we have n our budgets are for recurrent expenditure for payments of salaries and all that is required. So, for development, we have less than 30 percent.\n\nSo, if we are going to move forward, we must reverse it, we must produce , we must be involved in industrialization, in development in satisfying our needs, and so on. And that way you can create jobs. It\u2019s not by bringing them to the ministries and say, \u2018you are given a letter as administrative officer.\u2019 What does he have? He doesn\u2019t even have a table? When we finished school, work was looking for us and not us looking for work. They will come to you and say , \u2018Shell is coming to recruit tomorrow, do you want to go to Shell? Do you want to go the ministry?\u201d but today, you get Ph.D, you come back and the sole of your shoes will peel.\n\nAs a member PDP Board of Trustees, what is your view on your party\u2019s decision on zoning, particularly the presidency?\n\nIn 1998, when the People\u2019s Democratic Party was being established, after the G-34 had confronted the military, elder statesmen who believed in one Nigeria and who went through the trauma of military rule. The constitution of the PDP states very clearly that there shall be rotation and zoning of offices, both for the party and political office. And I have remained very consistent in my argument since 1998.\n\nAt the G-34 meeting, Alhaji Lawan Keita had moved that Alex Ekwueme should become the president. But Alex Ekwueme said it is a group, not a political party, that when it transforms into a political party, you can canvass whether I can be president or not.\n\nWhen the party came into being, it was agreed by all, including all the northerners that because of the injustice done to the South West, the Southwest should be given the opportunity to run. It was in Jos, AIT transmitted it live. That was the first live transmission into the United States of America, that President Bill Clinton, and I am saying it very publicly, called President Obasanjo, PDP candidate at that time, to congratulate him on the floor. And Obasanjo was surprised and asked Clinton how he got to know, and Clinton told him he was watching him on a Nigerian station, \u2018AIT, you call it?\u2018\n\nSo, because of the necessity, agreement had been reached that there will be zoning and rotation. But where do we start from? We said, let us start from the south, and we pushed the zoning to the south west. Don\u2019t forget that in 1995 draft constitution which Abacha conducted, in the reports and records, they had entrenched this idea of zoning and rotation where it was envisaged that the 6 geo-political zones will have a turn of 5 years each, so that in 30 years, we will end up on zoning and would have been one united country. From there, we can start exploiting merit.\n\nAfter deciding on the 4-year rotation, when Obasanjo came in, there was an expanded party caucus where it was canvassed that the military had done a lot of damage, and the PDP programmes could not be fully implemented within those 3 years, and would be desirable to extend it to as the constitution has provided for them to do eight years. Again, all the founding fathers, including Alex Ekwueme, Ogbemudia and all the PDP big wigs were present at the meeting. And again, it was the northern delegates who said we have no objection, we shall exercise patience. We will allow Obasanjo to have another 4 years, but with a proviso that if you do 8 years, we too will do 8 years. Let it be understood, and that is the foundation and everybody said \u201cyeah\u201d Ogbemudia gave vote of thanks, appreciated northern for their understanding. So, Obasanjo did up to 2007(8 years.).\n\nBy that agreement, power was supposed to have rotated back to the north. But I was a member of the S/South Assembly, I led the delegation to say the S/South had not had any opportunity, that the S/South should be given. I travelled round, I did not carry gun, I did not shout, I did not fight. All I did was that I engaged the Nigerian public. We travelled everywhere to lobby for a South-south president. By the time we got to the Convention, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo said \u2018look Dr Peter Odili, you have done very well, if we go into the conventions, you are going to win overwhelmingly, but we have had an understanding with the north, please let the north be the president.\n\nThat is how Umaru Yar\u2019Adua came in. Yar\u2019Adua, unfortunately did not live long to see his 8 years. He did only two and half years because in actual fact, I can tell you for free of charge that by November 2009, Alhaji Umaru Yar\u2019Adua was not available and therefore the vice president was the one overseeing things. The argument that he didn\u2019t have executive power, he didn\u2019t have constitutional power, let\u2019s leave that aside. He was the defacto head until Yar\u2019Adua died May 6, 2010. That was supposed to be the first term.\n\nI agitated at that time that for us not to break the principle already established, let us have the north complete the remaining term of four years, so that we can be done with the northern presidency, so that we can come back to the South. Mr. President as he was at that time, if you want to run, prepare yourself and you can even be vice president to any of the northerners that you want to choose if you feel you want to be relevant. If you feel you want to leave because you are president (because he was sworn in as president 2006), you can go on vacation and go and prepare yourself to run at the end of the tenure when you come back. \u2018But some people in the S/South said \u2018no, it\u2019s not possible. You cannot be so close to power and relinquish it.\u2019 Crisis set in. So, Jonathan did another 4 years. By 2015, the PDP had done 16 years in power, if you like, 14 years of the south, two years of the north. That is the situation up till today.\n\nNow, you say, you believe in justice, fairness and equity. The north has done 2 years, the South has done 14 years. Is that balance? The APC came into being in 2014, they don\u2019t have history. Now, in 2015, when we fielded in PDP, Jonathan, the north had started clamouring and agitating that it\u2019s their turn. You have spent 14 years, so allow us to complete our 4 years and we said no we have eaten smateese, we were very smart, and that is what plunged the country into this crisis. That is why we are in problem.\n\nSo, I am Peoples Democratic Party, I am guided by the constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party which in its preamble said for unity, for stability, for the growth of this country, we must rotate such that every part of the country will not be neglected. The APC, on its own, came in and also said they were adopting zoning and rotation. And in their own situation, they chose to pick a northern candidate knowing full well the agitation of the north. They fielded a northern candidate against the southerner. I believe everyone here knows my position and what my comments were at that time. At the end of the election, I do not agree, I do not believe Jonathan lost any election. But in any case, he didn\u2019t contest it , even when there were ample evidences. He has become a statesman. But that has not solved the problem of Nigeria. It has tripled it. So, APC has its own constitution and its own rules.\n\nIf in my own party I want to win election, I cannot win an election when there is injustice, when there is unfairness, when we are not guided by certain rules and regulations. In the PDP, all I am agitating for is that let us be fair and just. Let us put ourselves in the shoes of ourselves. Let us, as one family, as the party started still remain one. And in doing so, let us choose a candidate from the north. Some people have come to meet me to say, how can we allow them to do 8 years again? I say, sorry, in 2019, we fielded a northern candidate recommended by Ike Ekweremadu report. But again, the PDP was outmaneuvered.\n\nI don\u2019t agree that Atiku lost that election. I don\u2019t, I am not convinced, I am not persuaded. But INEC has said so. I am a citizen of Nigeria, I must live by the rules. I can only sob in myself but can\u2019t do anything about that. But I cannot as a PDP person go and adopt APC conditions and situations. I am criticising APC for failure, I am criticising APC for making Nigeria the capital of poverty in the whole world. Are these PDP policies? They are APC policies. So , I cannot be dragged into APC conditions and situation. So, for me very clearly, I want an undiluted, a properly organised party.\n\nIt is the APC policy of lack of adherence to the federal character principles that has brought us to this level of suspicion in the country. And it is because of that lack of respect for the federal character as provided in the constitution that we have a security council being peopled by a side of the country. I see Nigeria progressing, and the PDP principle of giving every part of the country a sense of belonging needs to be brought back.\n\nAnd the person that can bring back that principle of fairness, justice is from the north. We, the Southerners had the opportunity to be in power and we threw it away, so we can not monopolise everything and that is what gave birth to APC. If only we were fair, we were just, we were rational, we won\u2019t have been in this problem.\n\nOn Tinubu\n\nLet me tell you that His Excellency Governor Ahmed Bola Tinubu, before he became governor at , when in Mobil, whose headquarters is just directly in front of my house, as young men with Chief Akinyelure, Supo Ade Balogun, Ogungbe- all of us we go to Oniyanrin(entertainment location in Lagos), we drink, we eat, I dare say we womanised together. He became governor , God blessed him. But does that remove the fact that we were good friends as young men? Should I say because he belongs to a political party, he is now my enemy? He is the godfather of my second to my last daughter who has masters\u2019 degree. Bola Ahmed Bola Tinubu is the godfather. He is a Muslim but we were so close. So, if there is an interview and they say, your relationship with this person, I will say I don\u2019t know him because of politics? I don\u2019t believe in that. He is a philanthropist, he is kindhearted, he is supportive of ordinary persons. There is no journalist in Lagos whom Bola has not torched his life one way or the other. I praise him and wish him the very best in whatever he put his hands on. It has nothing to do with politics, but the good relationship we have always had.\n\nOn Jonathan and APC \u2018move\u2019\n\nHe has not told me. President Goodluck Jonathan has not mentioned it to anybody , I am sure. Goodluck Jonathan is a statesman. He sacrificed his ambition and fight after 2015 election because he wants a united Nigeria. Don\u2019t forget that the person we have at the helm of affairs when Africa\u2019s matters are mentioned globally today, is Olusegun Obasanjo. He is aging and very soon and may not be able to move around as he is now. President Jonathan is a younger person, he is able to represent Nigeria, promote Nigeria, attract friends and investors to Nigeria. That role falls on his shoulder very well. I encourage him to be in that position and be Nigeria\u2019s image maker and reference point. He is well-suited for that and I wish him the very best.\n\nWhat would you devote your remaining years to?\n\nService to humanity",
          "summary": "The media owner who couldn\u2019t speak in the early years of his life was already \u2018sentenced\u2019 to death by doctors who declared he won\u2019t make it beyond 35 years.\nAt that time, I felt highly discriminated against, I felt I was likely to be denied the opportunity to live.\nThe people just came up to say I had been poisoned and people that committed the atrocity were there present.\nPossibly, that 35 years was why God so ordered my life as smooth sailing as it was up to that 35 years.\nPresident Jonathan is a younger person, he is able to represent Nigeria, promote Nigeria, attract friends and investors to Nigeria.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDespite the challenges of funding and other issues, the implementation of the N2.3 trillion Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) has made significant impact across different sectors.\n\n\n\nIt has also helped the country to effectively tackle the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic through creation of jobs and safeguarding the existing ones, while also putting the economy on the path of sustainable growth, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said.\n\nHe, however, expressed concerns over delays from the structured lending financing source of the ESP, which, according to him, had so far suffered significant delays.\n\n\n\nThese were some of the highlights at the day one of the two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review retreat, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, where the VP Monday afternoon delivered the progress report on the ESP implementation.\n\n\n\nAt the retreat organised to assess progress made towards the achievement of the nine key priorities of the Buhari administration, Osinbajo said: \u201cThe ESP tried to mitigate the shock of COVID-19, but also took the opportunity to try to tackle longstanding structural challenges, while repositioning the economy for the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor instance, Osinbajo explained that following the global pandemic, \u201cthere were sharp declines in some key sectors: Transportation sector declined by 49%, Hospitality sector fell 40%, the Education sector fell 24%, Real Estate declined by 22%, Trade declined by 17% and Construction declined by 40%.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut since the ESP implementation began, which was credited as a major reason why Nigeria exited recession faster than predicted, data showed that these sectors have rebounded to positive growth: Transportation to 77%, Hospitality to 2%, Education to 1%, Real Estate to 4%, Trade to 23%, and Construction to 4%.\u201d\n\nRescue plans\n\nHe further said: \u201cIn response (to the pandemic), the President took two actions. The first was to set up a small inter-ministerial Committee headed by the Minister of Finance to quickly examine the implications of and the immediate mitigation steps that would be taken for the economic shocks we were experiencing. The second step which Mr. President took was to ask that we draw up a full Economic Sustainability Plan to provide at least a 12-month response to the fallout of the pandemic. And Mr. President asked me to chair the Committee to draw up the plan and later to implement it.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were clear \u2013 and this was Mr. President\u2019s position \u2013 that the only way of avoiding an economic disaster that could last for years was for government to essentially put forward a major fiscal stimulus plan; with clear objectives of saving jobs, creating new ones, supporting businesses that may close down, and employees that may not be paid during lockdowns, and, of course, healthcare support to reduce the COVID-19 caseload.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first objective of the ESP was Improved Healthcare and lowering the COVID-19 caseload, the second was Restoring Growth; the third \u2013 job creation and safeguarding existing jobs; the fourth \u2013 Increased Local Production, and part of that was what we called the Guaranteed Offtake Scheme; the fifth was Reducing Social Vulnerabilities; and that essentially was looking at how to improve the quality and effectiveness of the Social Investment Programmes and the scope of the programme,\u201d the VP added.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the implementation of different components of the Plan, including the MSMEs Survival Fund, Social Housing Scheme, and Solar Home System, among others, he said the ESP had recorded significant progress in achieving its objectives,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFor instance, Prof. Osinbajo noted that the ESP MSMEs Survival Fund designed to create jobs and safeguard existing ones, supported 1.1 million Nigerians and businesses nationwide.\n\n\n\nThe Survival Fund has different schemes, namely: the Guaranteed off-take Scheme, Payroll Support Scheme, Artisans & Transport Support Scheme, General MSME Grant Scheme and Formalization Support Scheme.\n\n\n\nExplaining, the VP noted that under the Payroll support, \u201cdirect grants were given for a three-month period to 459,000 beneficiaries across the country, who received a total of N90, 000 and N150, 000 (N30,000 and N50,000 respectively per month) in salaries for the three-month period.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen, 293,000 transport workers and artisans received one-off grants of N30, 000 each. While 82,000 businesses also received one-off grants under the MSME General grant scheme; and about 255,000 enterprises benefited from the CAC free registration of companies under the Formalization Support Scheme.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, under the ESP Agriculture for Food and Jobs Plan, Vice President Osinbajo noted that 6.39 million farmers have been enumerated so far and these farmers were geo-tagged to their land.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cSo far, 3.63 million passed the first stage of validation and another 2.47 million passed the second stage of validation. We\u2019re validating them also for BVNs.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlso, 320 hectares of land has been cleared across 8 states at 40 hectares per state. The States are Kwara, Plateau, Cross River, Edo, Kaduna, Ekiti, Osun, and Ogun. These are States that require land clearing. Of course, many States do not require land clearing, and we simply supported those states directly. \u20a6 471bn is allocated as loans to farmers across 14 Crop Value Chains, Beef Production, Aquaculture and Poultry Farming.\n\n\n\n\u201cA subsidy of N5.1billion was paid to over one million farmers under the Fertilizer Subsidy Programme, which is a critical part of the Food for Jobs programme.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. President approved a programme of giving subsidies to farmers for bags of fertilisers to each farmer depending on the size of the farm. But the strategy here was to give the farmer the amount of the subsidy directly in cash paid to their BVN verified account. Mr. President approved the immediate disbursement of the Fertilizer Subsidy Fund to smallholder, vulnerable farmers in the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe VP also mentioned the ESP Public Works and Aviation component, saying \u201cconstruction work is ongoing on 193 road sections totalling 3,707km of roads; with 26,021 Nigerians employed in rehabilitation/construction of these roads so far. The construction of 345km of rural roads, 205 bore holes and 10 treatment plants to create jobs and develop rural areas in 36 States and the FCT has commenced.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, Osinbajo said the ESP Social Housing Programme had helped to create thousands of jobs and boost the local building materials industry in the country.\n\n\n\nNoting that so far about 1,151.689 hectares of land has been made ready for development, the VP said, \u201cthe target is to build 300,000 houses. This has the capacity to accommodate a further 34,550 homes. The Programme is being funded by a mix of resources, including Financing from the Federal Ministry of Finance, and a loan from the Central Bank under the ESP.\n\n\n\n\u201cBuyers have a window of at least 15 years to pay for their homes. The design is to build two-bedroom homes costing not more than N2 million \u2013 N3.75m for a three-room unit, and N4.25 for a four-room unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the moment, 4,700 homes have been approved in 7 States for financing for commencement in October. 5,400 are scheduled for November 2021.\u201d\n\n\n\nSlow progress\n\nBut the VP observed that \u201cprogress has been much slower than envisaged. There are continuing delays in the disbursement of funds from the CBN. The Debenture agreement for the sum of N200bn with the CBN which represents the bulk of the financing was agreed in April and has been signed by all.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe had the same observations on the delays in the Solar Power Naija, the ESP Solar Electrification Programme, which is also designed to create jobs and develop a local solar industry and provide access to electricity to 5 million households in off-grid, under-served communities through new solar connections. This would bring energy access to 25 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt will include the assembly or manufacturing of components of off-grid solutions to facilitate growth of the local manufacturing industry, while the use of local content will be encouraged. It will create in all 250,000 new jobs in the energy sector.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the 5m Solar Connections target is being delayed because while N140bn was allocated through the CBN to facilitate it, only N7bn of that has been disbursed,\u201d Vice President Osinbajo further stated.\n\n.Explaining some key challenges of the implementation of the programme, the VP listed unwillingness of CBN to disburse funds, and the risk aversion of public and private financial institutions, particularly for power projects.\n\n\n\nAgric plan of the ESP\n\n\n\nProf. Osinbajo further disclosed that \u201conly N14bn of the N471bn as loans to farmers across 14 crop value chains have been disbursed to commercial banks. Even then, that amount is yet to be utilised by farmers due to late release for the 2021 wet farming season.\u201d\n\nTasks CBN\n\nHe also called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to review its strategy on foreign exchange and ensure the Naira value reflects the market reality, rather than what he described as \u201cartificially low,\u201d deterring investors from bringing foreign exchange into the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs for the exchange rate, I think we need to move our rates to be as reflective of the market as possible. This, in my own respectful view, is the only way to improve supply,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get new dollars into the system, where the exchange rate is artificially low. And everyone knows by how much our reserves can grow. I\u2019m convinced that the demand management strategy currently being adopted by the CBN needs a rethink, and that is my view.\n\n\n\n\u201cCurrently, the naira is changing at N411 to $1 at the official side of the market, while the same goes for about N565 at the parallel market.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere must be synergy between the fiscal and the monetary authority. We must be able to deal with the synergy, we must handle the synergy between the monetary authority, the CBN, and the fiscal side.\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes, it appears that there is competition\u2026 If you look at some of the interventions, you will find that those interventions are interventions that should be managed by ministries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should handle MSMEs interventions, and we should know what the CBN is doing. In other words, if the CBN is intervening in the MSME sector, it should be with the full cooperation and consent of the ministry of industry.\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes you will get people who are benefiting more than once because we simply have no line of sight on what is going on, on one side.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stated that there should be one-clear economic plan, not two, saying \u201cwe cannot have a CBN-led economic plan and a government led plan. We would end up duplicating, and even there may be beneficiaries of grants benefiting multiple times.\u201d\n\n\n\nLauds Buhari\n\nOn how Nigeria survived the economic challenge of 2020, Prof. Osinbajo praised President Buhari, saying, he deserves the credit for providing steady leadership through the crisis.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me say on the whole, that we have been able to weather the storm of a very serious economic challenge. I think that is largely due to the steady and stable leadership we received from the President. I think if Mr. President had panicked in that period, we would have had a lot of difficulties, perhaps we would be in a much worse situation.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe deserves the commendation for providing that steady hand when that was required.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn June 2020, in response to the fallout of the pandemic, President Buhari mandated the Vice President as chair of the Economic Sustainability Committee, to coordinate the implementation of the ESP aimed at cushioning the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

          "text": "Poultry Farmers Association of Nigeria, PFAN in Kwara State has raised the alarm that the high cost of eggs production, particularly the raising of chicken, has discouraged a lot of poultry farmers from being in the business.\n\nThe farmers have therefore called on Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq to assist the association by ensuring a reduction in prices of poultry feed with a view to ensuring that the proteinous food is available for every family irrespective of their status in the society.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark World Egg Day and the 20th anniversary of the global event, the state chairman of PFAN, Mr. Ojo Akinwumi Richard lamented that poultry farmers are presently running at loss.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to the federal government to allow the importation of poultry feeds into the country, noting that Nigerian farmers cannot produce enough grains to meet poultry feeds production.\n\nThe chairman, however, assured at this year\u2019s event, tagged: \u201cEat your egg today and every day\u201d that the association would continue to do its best in making eggs available for Nigerians.\n\nDelivering a lecture on the nutrition benefits of eggs to human beings, the guest lecturer, Dr. Eunice Foluke Sola-Ojo advised people from age 0 to 40 years to take three eggs per day while older people should take at least one egg per day because of the nutritional value.\n\nSola-Ojo said: \u201cEgg is highly nutritious with about 13 vitamins, except Vitamin C.

Eggs are good for growing children, and they can afford three eggs per day, while an egg per day is good for an adult.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Director of Livestock, Kwara State Ministry of Agriculture, Mohammed Umar Hammed assured the poultry farmers of the government\u2019s support in making grains available at a cheaper rate by next year\n\nCommenting on the level at which people now deviate from poultry farming following the high cost of feed, the director appealed to members of the association to go back to business, promising that the government would continue to support them.",

          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 general elections, leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has inaugurated a national reconciliation committee to mend fences among different warring gladiators in the party.\n\nThe committee headed by former governor of Nasarawa state and Senator representing Nasarawa West, Abdullahi Adamu, assured that it will perform better than previous National Reconciliation Committees headed by former governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and that of former governor of Osun state, Chief Bisi Akande.\n\nRecall that both Tinubu and Akande were at different times appointed to reconcile various groups and interests after the 2015 general elections and 2019 general elections but the panels were unable to meet the targets.\n\nThe ruling party is believed to have been more divided after the recent ward and local government congresses nationwide.\n\nSpeaking Monday at the national secretariat of the APC after another National Reconciliation Committee was inaugurated, Senator Adamu, who was appointed to lead the new panel promised a great deal.\n\nWhen asked about what his committee can achieve compare to the two previous reconciliation panels, the former governor said: \u201cSomehow, all the members of the National Reconciliation Committee that I have seen are positive. We believe we will be able to accomplish the responsibilities bestowed and the mandate given us today.\n\n\u201cWe will, as maybe appropriate consult with leader Asiwaju Jagaban. We will consult with the first national chairman of our great party, Chief Akande, who was my contemporary as governor of Osun state, and other prominent leaders and stakeholders of the party that will take interest in what we are doing, we will not hesitate to approach and talk to them and see the best way forward in reconciling our ranks.\u201d\n\nThe committee is expected to \u201cconduct appropriate engagement between identified groups in each State where there are disputes with a view to bringing about genuine reconciliation and establishing lasting peace and unity in the party.\n\n\u201cConsult with larty leaders and concerned members as the committee deems necessary with a view to achieving peace therein.\n\n\u201cCritically examine areas of conflict on the just concluded Ward and Local Government Congress and advance solutions in the circumstance.\u201d\n\nWhile inaugurating the committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state, urged the members of the committee to remain resolute and dedicated to execute the assignment with a spirit of teamwork, taking the interest of the party above personal and selfish interests for APC to remain strong, united and Nigeria\u2019s leading political party.\n\nAccording to Buni, the task before the committee is very important and crucial.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to reconcile, harmonize, integrate and unite members of the party. It is also expected to resolve real or seeming differences and to cement all cracks for us to approach the National Convention with a united front.\n\n\u201cYour report on resolution of these discrepancies would indicate our readiness as a united and strong family for the national convention. Your assignment therefore, has great impact and influence on the convention.\u201d",

          "text": "The need to open more access to digital literacy for girls so that they can compete favorably with their male counterparts has been emphasized.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa, a gender-based not-for-profit organization, brought this to the fore Monday on the occasion of the 2021 International Day of the Girl Child.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the event, founder and Executive Director of Empower Her 4 Africa, Mrs. Charlene Makai Yusuf, asserted that there\u2019s no limit to the possibility of what girls can do with technology if given equal access like their male counterparts.\n\nMrs. Yusuf said, \u201cIt is important to bridge the digital gender gap so that our girls can live their full potentials and be part of the unfolding new world order of digital compliance.\n\nAlso speaking, Consultant on girl child rights to Empower Her 4 Africa, Mrs. Abosede Oladayo, decried the poor rate of enrollment of girls in tech-related courses such as Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, STEM.\n\nAs part of activities lined up to commemorate the day, the NGO staged a road walk procession in the city of Abuja to sensitize Nigerians and create awareness on the need to bridge the gender digital divide between boys and girls as well as the importance of digital literacy and skills in tech-related courses for the girl child.\n\nThe group also organized a digital Training session for girls at Govt Junior secondary school Damagasa in Lokogoma Abuja.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa in its usual practice, equally enrolled and paid school fees for ten adopted indigent girls at the school.\n\nRecall that October 11 of every year is designated as the International Day of the Girl Child by the United Nations, UN, to bring to fore issues and challenges faced by the girl child, that hinders her well-being and a better quality of life and how to proffer solutions to them.\n\nThis year\u2019s theme: \u201cDigital Generation. Our Generation.\u201d emphasizes the imperativeness of digital literacy and inclusivity for the Girl Child.\n\nAccording to experts, the Covid-19 pandemic has migrated the world from physical engagement to a virtual platform.\n\nThe pandemic has also transformed the world into a digital village as school learnings, business earnings, and social connecting are now being done via digital platforms.\n\nThis has also transformed the future of work as existing jobs are being modified, and new ones are emerging at the frontiers of our economies, which require knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).\n\nBut over 2.2 billion people below the age of 25 (mostly girls) still do not have access to the internet at home, meaning girls are most likely to be cut off.\n\nAlso, the gender gap for global internet users grew from 11 percent in 2013 to 17 percent in 2019 while in the world\u2019s least developed countries, it hovers around 43 percent.\n\nThe implication of this is that girls are also less likely than boys to use and own devices, and gain access to tech-related skills and jobs.\n\nExperts believe addressing the inequity and exclusion that spans geographies and generations is vital as we seek to usher in a digital revolution for all, and with all.\n\nEmpower Her 4 Africa, therefore, called on government and relevant authorities to increase access to digital education and devices for girls, while also demanding that all schools be equipped with functional state-of-the-art digital laboratories to boost access to digital literacy for girls.",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nChidinma Ojukwu has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Super TV CEO, Usifo Ataga.\n\nThe 22-year-old did so on Tuesday when she and one Adedapo Quadri, who are the key suspects in the murder case were arraigned before Justice Yetunde Adesanya of the Lagos State High Court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square.\n\nBoth suspects pleaded not guilty to eight counts bordering on the offences of murder, forgery and stealing.\n\nChidinma\u2019s sister, Egbuchu Chioma, was also arraigned, as an iPhone 7 belonging to the late Ataga, was said to have been recovered from her.\n\nChioma, however, pleaded not guilty to the 9th count of being in possession of the stolen property.\n\nThey are being prosecuted by the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution, Mrs Olayinka Adeyemi.\n\nA U-turn\n\nWhen Chidinma was arrested on June 24, she had initially admitted to killing Usifo after his lifeless body was found in a pool of blood with multiple stab wounds at a hotel in the Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nBut contrary to her initial statements that she had stabbed Ataga in self-defense, the 22-year-old later in an interview in July, denied having anything to do with his death.\n\nShe explained that while they were lodged together in the short-let apartment, she briefly stepped out to buy some things only to return to his lifeless body.\n\n\u201cAs I was leaving the apartment, he stood up to lock the door. When I came back, I knocked but there was no response. Then I opened the door and realized it wasn\u2019t locked,\u201d Chidinma said.\n\n\u201cThe duvet was on the floor and pillows. The couch was facing the door and the bed was stained with blood and the floor where he was. Music was on, the TV was on. The room was in disarray like someone broke in.\n\n\u201cThen I saw him on the floor, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was afraid. I thought if I raised an alarm I would be arrested because we were the only people in the room\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking in the interview, a cousin of the deceased said the state in which he later found the corpse was very questionable. According to him, the extent of the stab wounds as well as the way Ataga\u2019s hands were tied, was so bad that the act could not have been done by Chidinma alone.\n\nShe, on the other hand, claimed that the only reason she initially took responsibility for the incident was that it was just both of them in the room and she felt that no one would believe her story.\n\n\u201cI never had anything to do with his death. I didn\u2019t involve anybody. I don\u2019t know who must have come into the apartment. Definitely, somebody did but I don\u2019t who the person is. I don\u2019t know what happened when I left to buy food,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Cheikh Fall did not hold back last week when he saw French President Emmanuel Macron during a plenary session of a France-Africa conference.\n\n\u201cI asked Macron to seek forgiveness from Africans, stop empowering African dictators and stop the pseudo paternalistic cooperation,\u201d the Senegalese social entrepreneur told Al Jazeera, recalling the exchange.\n\nFall was one of several young Africans who peppered Macron with unfiltered criticism of France during Friday\u2019s event, seen as part of the French president\u2019s attempt to reshape his country\u2019s relations with former colonies on the continent.\n\nIn a bid to leave the infamous legacy of FrancAfrique \u2013 a decade-old shadowy network of French politicians and African elites aiming to maintain French domination in post-colonial Africa \u2013 behind, Macron invited hundreds of young businesspeople, artists and researchers to the meeting in Montpellier \u2013 but no African heads of state or government leaders.\n\nSince coming to power in 2017, 43-year-old Macron has presented himself as the standard-bearer of a new generation that aims to start a new chapter between Paris and its former colonies after a long and disturbing history that haunts contemporary France to this day.\n\nBut specific instances from that troubled past apparently caught him off guard on the stage as he awkwardly listened to young Africans who assailed Paris\u2019s \u201carrogance\u201d and \u201cpaternalism\u201d in its asymmetric relations with African countries and urged him to offer an apology for colonial-era crimes.\n\nCornered by candid criticism, Macron promised an honest assessment of the colonial past. \u201cWe must recognise this responsibility and bear it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is part of our past and of the relationship.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the conference took place as Macron aims to divert the focus of ties from the colonial past, with France finding itself in a fierce competition of power with growing Chinese, Russian and Turkish involvement in its \u201cbackyard\u201d.\n\nIn this sense, the French president has taken a number of steps including commissioning a report that found that Paris bears \u201coverwhelming responsibilities\u2019\u2019 over the Rwandan genocide and was \u201cblind\u201d to preparations for the 1994 massacres in which about 800,000 people were killed.\n\nHowever, as much as the report marked a rare confession by the French state, it also cleared Paris of complicity in the genocide and carefully placed blame on the then-President Francois Mitterrand instead of the French state itself.\n\nSeparately, Macron embraced another state report on colonial rule in Algeria that recommended the establishment of a \u201cmemories and truth\u201d commission but ruled out an official apology for the crimes committed.\n\nMacron has also agreed to return some of the artefacts stolen from African countries during colonisation; to declassify secret files on the assassination of anti-imperialist Burkina Faso leader Thomas Sankara; and to reform, not end, the CFA franc, a French-backed currency used by former French colonies in West Africa that is seen by many as a symbol of neo-colonialism.\n\nNathaniel Powell, an analyst at Oxford Analytica, said such steps were symbolic and not structural gestures.\n\n\u201cThey are illustrative of Macron\u2019s longer-term soft-power aspirations of overcoming anti-French sentiment while maintaining the centrality of France as a privileged African partner,\u201d Powell told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said there was a clash between these aspirations and the security interests of the French state.\n\n\u201cNone of the steps can alter the \u2018hard\u2019 aspects of the relationship \u2013 support for autocracies, ambivalence about democratic aspirations, a mindset hyper-focused on security interests and a kind of autocratic political stability that benefits those interests. As long as those remain the pillars of France\u2019s African policy, then nothing else matters very much,\u201d Powell said.\n\nIn fact, many former French presidents, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, have attempted to reshape France\u2019s engagement in Africa but ended up leading the military operations on the continent.\n\nProfessor Bruno Charbonneau, at Canada\u2019s Royal Military College Saint-Jean, said this was not a coincidence as he highlighted the historical legacies that define the ties between France and a number of African countries.\n\n\u201cThree structural factors always come into play: One, the French military has an institutional interest in sustaining French military engagement in Africa, or at least sustaining the capacity to intervene; and it also has much influence into the policymaking process and decision-making when it comes to Francophone Africa,\u201d Charbonneau told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cSecond, whatever the context or situation, Francophone African elites expect France to intervene and be part of the discussion, knowing that they can fall back on Paris for help,\u201d he said. \u201cLastly, at the UN Security Council, France is recognised to be the penholder and diplomatic leader for all things related to Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nStill, France has found itself increasingly at loggerheads with a number of its former colonies, facing waves of rising discontentment.\n\nEarlier this month, Macron triggered a fresh crisis with Algeria when, according to the French daily Le Monde, he said the former French colony was ruled by a \u201cpolitical-military system\u201d and that its official history has been \u201ctotally re-written\u201d based on \u201ca discourse of hatred towards France\u201d.\n\nThe Algerian presidency swiftly hit back at Macron\u2019s \u201cinsulting\u201d remarks, while Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra said France needs to \u201cdecolonise\u201d its history and free itself of certain attitudes which are linked to an ideology that normalised \u201cthe crime against humanity which was the colonisation of Algeria, Mali and the colonisation of so many African people\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mali, the reports of possible deployment of mercenaries hired by the controversial Wagner Group in the country has added another layer to already tense ties between Paris and the soldiers behind two military coups since August 2020.\n\nFrance, which has deployed more than 5,000 soldiers across the Sahel region, strongly opposes such a move, worrying the mercenaries would undermine the France-led military operations against armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda.\n\nOn the other hand, Malian leaders present the possible deployment as \u201cPlan B\u201d in the fight against the armed groups, accusing France of \u201cabandoning\u201d Mali following its decision to reduce its troops by about half and close down military bases.\n\nThe rising tensions have also come at a time when anti-French sentiment has become widely popular among Malians who accuse Paris of failing to contain the escalating violence and pursuing a hidden agenda.\n\nMacron\u2019s approach to military takeovers in Mali and Chad has also led many to question France\u2019s priorities in the region. While the French president firmly rejected the two coups in Mali and urged for democratic governance, he quickly endorsed the military power grab in Chad after the death of President Idriss Deby, a vital figure in France\u2019s security apparatus in the region for decades.\n\nFor Ndongo Samba Sylla, a Senegalese development economist, last week\u2019s conference was just a rebranding of France\u2019s neocolonial engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Francafrique is out of breath and it needs a new look. France is inventing its African civil society and co-opting its own African intellectuals in order to give the illusion of change,\u201d Sylla told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWhat credibility can be given to this rebranding exercise when Macron himself doesn\u2019t hesitate to chew up French civil society and to destroy democratic expression in Francophone Africa by endorsing military coups and dynastic successions,\u201d he asked.\n\nNonetheless, Fall is hopeful the event will help forge healthier relations between France and African countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to breathe new life into the relationship. I want the summit to be a new platform to redefine the relations,\u201d Fall said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to define the possible futures of FrancAfrique.\u201d",

          "text": "Mohammad sat in the smaller grocery store where he worked and flipped through the pages of a notebook, filled with a long list of customers indebted to the shop.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are struggling with money and asking us to let them pay later,\u201d the 30-year-old Syrian refugee from Deraa told Al Jazeera, as a growing fuel crunch has led food prices to skyrocket.\n\n\u201cWe have to try to be patient with them. Things have become much worse with the fuel crisis over the summer.\u201d\n\nThe small shop is located in the heart of Beirut\u2019s semi-industrial Karantina neighbourhood, a stone\u2019s throw away from the destroyed port.\n\nMany of the shelves at the shop were packed, but that is because people are simply focusing on household necessities, Mohammad said.\n\n\u201cSo, nobody is buying coffee as you can see,\u201d he said, pointing to dozens of jars on the shelves.\n\n\u201cMost people go for bread, vegetables, and those dairy products in the fridge over there.\u201d\n\nBut even many staple food items were no longer affordable: he has struggled to sell olive oil, as it has soared in price.\n\nMohammad weighs a bag of potatoes. He says customers visit less often and buy less than they once did, because food has become expensive [Kareem Chehayeb/Al Jazeera]\n\nLebanon\u2019s food crisis is not a recent development. The World Food Programme estimated that food prices have gone up by 628 percent in just two years, compounding Lebanon\u2019s economic meltdown, which has plunged three-quarters of its population into poverty and devalued the Lebanese pound by about 90 percent.\n\nHowever, the food crisis has significantly worsened in recent months amid fuel shortages and price rises.\n\nThe Lebanese government has gradually been lifting fuel subsidies since June, and has increased petrol prices four times in under a month in a bid to deal with crippling shortages. At the same time, it has struggled to unroll a cashcard programme to replace the subsidies.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanon has been increasingly hit by extended blackouts as state-provided electricity has dwindled to almost nothing, while diesel fuel prices for private generators have skyrocketed, too \u2013 if fuel can even be found in the first place.\n\n\u201cOur food prices are getting more expensive because we have to pay much more for the private generator provider to account for fuel price hikes,\u201d Mohammad said, shaking his head in disbelief.\n\n\u201cAnd all our produce in those baskets over there have especially become more expensive, because the guy who delivers it to us from the vegetable market has to pay more for gasoline.\u201d\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy ministry announced earlier this week that they had raised the price of bread for a sixth time this year \u2013 partly due to the weakening local currency, but also due to the petrol and fuel crisis as transportation costs have soared.\n\n\u201cFuel and gasoline prices are continuing to increase, so we anticipate that food prices will continue to go up,\u201d World Food Programme spokesperson Rasha Abou Dargham told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn April, the WFP provided food assistance for one in every six people. After the fuel crisis worsened, they now support one in every four people in Lebanon.\n\nMohammad worked for about 10 hours in the shop every day for a modest income, and a small allowance to buy food items from the shop which comes to just less than 900,000 Lebanese pounds ($47).\n\nWith his salary and some help from charities he could just about pay for his rent and some other expenses, so he has had to compromise on the food he eats and he now skips one meal every day.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, he is among the 67 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now skipping meals.\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t eat meat anymore \u2013 that\u2019s out of the question,\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cBut thankfully, I can get by with no more with two meals a day.\u201d\n\nTwo blocks away, Walaa \u2013 who fled to Lebanon from Syria about five years ago \u2013 looked after her daughter and three sons in their cramped two-room ground floor apartment. The kids were out of school, and spent most of their time indoors. Her 12-year-old, the eldest among them, sat quietly watching his siblings. Walaa said he weighs just 17 kilograms.\n\nIt was past noon, and the kids still had not eaten breakfast yet. \u201cWe try to make sure the kids have two meals every day,\u201d she said.\n\nWalaa\u2019s husband prunes trees in downtown Beirut, but has struggled to work as many hours as he used to after he was wounded in the Beirut Port explosion more than a year ago. He suffered from multiple bone fractures and head trauma.\n\nShe has tried to work various day jobs to help, but the family was behind on rent and soaring food prices further squeezed their already straitened budget.\n\n\u201cWe now just buy bread, pasta, rice, and try to get onions, tomatoes, and potatoes whenever possible,\u201d Walaa said. \u201cWe try to get the kids yoghurt and cheese once or twice a month because they really like it.\u201d\n\nThe family had also resorted to drinking tap water, as bottled water has become increasingly expensive, which Walaa said has made the kids sick.\n\nMeats and fruit have become unaffordable for the family, but once a month, they will buy chicken.\u201cIt\u2019s like a celebratory occasion when that happens,\u201d she said with a sigh. And because of that, she believed the kids are fatigued and lethargic.\n\n\u201cThey get tired when we go for short walks.\u201d\n\nImpoverished Syrian refugees have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.\n\nAccording to the UNHCR, an estimated 90 percent of Syrian refugees in Lebanon now live in extreme poverty \u2013 amid a wider figure of 36 percent in the country.\n\n\u201cThat means they cannot afford what we consider the basic food items for survival,\u201d WFP\u2019s Abou Dargham explained. \u201cAnd this does not include meat, nor dairy products.\u201d\n\nThe Lebanese government, now led by billionaire Prime Minister Najib Mikati, hopes to renew negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a recovery programme, and to receive economic aid from the international community.\n\nExperts have said it could take years for the economy to recover, with Lebanon needing to uproot decades of systematic corruption and restructure an inefficient economy.\n\nMeanwhile, aid organisations and charities are struggling to keep up with the surging demand, while the Lebanese government remains cash-strapped. The United Nations recently said that starvation could be a \u201cgrowing reality\u201d for thousands.\n\nAbou Dargham said that this hunger crisis was \u201cunprecedented\u201d, and has also affected hundreds of thousands of Lebanese families that never used to worry about putting food on the table.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tripled our assistance, but the scale-up is gradual,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople who once never had issues with putting food on the table have suddenly plunged into poverty.\u201d",

Tigrayan forces then invaded the neighbouring region of Amhara in July, saying it was a tactic to try to force Amhara forces out of the heavily militarised region.\n\nThe Amhara regional spokesman signalled on Twitter last week an offensive against Tigrayan forces could be imminent, and since Friday there have been heavy air raids reported in several Tigrayan-held areas of Amhara.\n\nSamuel Getachew, an independent journalist, said the government had been preparing for this moment for a while.\n\n\u201cThere was mobilisation going on. In Amhara region, for instance, it was an open secret \u2013 and this is a defining moment that the Ethiopian government has been saying is forthcoming,\u201d Getachew told Al Jazeera from Ethiopia\u2019s Semera. \u201cIt is expected to be bloody.\u201d\n\nAccording to Getachew, the British government asked its citizens to avoid the Tigray region earlier on Monday, which may signal there will be an offensive \u201cin the days to come\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe objective [of the Ethiopian government] is to prevent the TPLF from having a chance to govern Tigray \u2013 they just want to kill or eliminate the essence of the TPLF,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Abiy administration has said eliminating the TPLF will become a priority for the government.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Getachew, the TPLF spokesperson, said the Ethiopian military \u2013 with the support of Amhara special forces \u2013 \u201claunched coordinated offensives on all fronts\u201d. He said there was fighting in the Amhara region\u2019s Wegeltena, Wurgessa and Haro towns.\n\nThe fighting since November 2020 has displaced millions of people and forced hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans into famine \u2013 a situation the United Nations has blamed on a government blockade. The government has denied that it is blocking aid.\n\nThe fighting has made about 5.2 million people in Tigray \u2013 more than 90 percent of the population \u2013 and another 1.7 million people in Afar and Amhara dependent on food aid.\n\nThe new fighting defies calls for peace by the United Nations and others, and the threat of new sanctions from the United States and European Union.\n\n\u201cOur forces have no other option than to defend their people,\u201d the Tigray statement said.",
