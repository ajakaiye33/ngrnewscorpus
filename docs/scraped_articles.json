          "text": "The Senate Public Account Committee is currently investigating the authorities of the National Identity Management Commission over the alleged non-compliance with Public Procurement Act in the award of a N229m contract.\n\nThe SPAC hinged the probe on the query contained in the 2017 report of the Auditor General for the Federation which it is currently scrutinising.\n\nThe Chairman of the Senate panel, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, sustained the query at the sitting of his panel on Tuesday and demanded further information from the agency.\n\nThe query partly read, \u201cAudit observed that capital payment vouchers reference number: NIMC/LS/IGL/1/11/105, dated 25th October 2017 for \u20a6229.7 million showed that NIMC procured 22 units of HP blade servers for Morpho BSS upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe items were supplied. There was no evidence of Ministerial Tender\u2019s Board approval, thus, negating the mandatory Open Competitive bidding. Public advertisement in at least two national dailies, as required by Financial Regulation 2907 (1) and section 251(ii) of the Public Procurement Act was absent.\n\n\u201cThere was an initial payment of \u20a6103.4 million vide payment voucher number NIMC/01/016 CA/18 dated 19/01/18, representing 45% of the contract sum as against the mobilisation fee of 15 per cent. The other subsequent payments were not also backed by an interim performance certificate as required by Section 35(2) of the public procurement Act 2007.\n\n\u201cThis is an indication of weakness in the internal control system at National Identity Management Commission.\n\n\u201cThis could lead to poor value for money and possibility of misapplication and misappropriation of funds.\n\n\u201cManagement\u2019s response: No response was received from management at the time of our report. Recommendation: The Director-General is required to refund the sum of \u20a6229 million.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Director-General of NIMC, Aliyu Abubakar Aziz, said that the contract fell within the threshold of the Commission\u2019s Tenders Board because it is classified under \u2018works\u2019.\n\nHe said that all the servers had been supplied before the initial payment of 45 per cent which represents part payment and not mobilisation due to paucity of funds.\n\nHe further informed the committee that the amount was meant to procure 22 blade servers to accommodate 20 million enrollment records.\n\nHe also said that the contract was a continuation of procurement of Enterprise Servers and Storage Solution and Equipment which was awarded in 2012.\n\nHe added that the Commission had registered 57 million people as of Tuesday while 90 servers were needed to register 100 million Nigerians.\n\nHe said the Commission will on Wednesday submit a N25bn proposal to buy more servers in order to take the whole population.\n\nBut Uroghide said that it is wrong for the Commission to continue the 2012 procurement process in 2017.\n\nThe Chairman said, \u201cWe are supposed to do a status inquiry on your Commission because it looks like all your documents are muddled up.\u201d\n\nThe Committee, therefore, mandated the NIMC management to reappear next week Thursday with more documents to back up their claims.",

          "text": "A 2021 cost-of-living survey by consultancy firm Mercer, has named Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, as the world\u2019s most expensive city for foreign workers.\n\nThe annual survey, in determining its results, evaluated the cost of more than 200 goods and services, including the price of housing, food, and transportation.\n\nIt also considered factors such as currency fluctuation, cost inflation, etc.\n\nThe annual survey claims as its purpose, helping governments and companies across the world with the means of determining how much they should pay foreign workers.\n\n\u201cThis survey provides key insights for employers, employees, governments and city authorities looking to improve their attractiveness to entice foreign talent, businesses and investments,\u201d according to Mercer.\n\nLast year, Ashgabat was ranked second on Mercer\u2019s list of most expensive cities to live in, beaten by Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong and most countries in the top 10 earned their rank on account of them being viable economic hubs, a condition that naturally led to a hike in the price of housing and general cost of living in these cities.\n\nIn Ashgabat\u2019s case, its high ranking is as a result of economic depression and \u201chigh local inflation\u201d as described by Jean-Philippe Sarra of Mercer.\n\nAnother reason for Ashgabat\u2019s economic troubles may be traced to Turkmenistan\u2019s dependence on natural gas exports for revenue, a national cash cow that has since taken a hit due to global low gas prices, leading to hyper-inflation in the Central Asian country.\n\nAshgabat\u2019s move to first place may also be as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which a report by Human Rights Watch said has \u201cdrastically exacerbated Turkmenistan\u2019s pre-existing food crisis\u201d.\n\nSome other cities in the top 10 include Beirut, Zurich, Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore.\n\nBishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, was ranked as the least expensive city for expatriates.",

The World Bank has already approved operations to support vaccine roll out in 36 countries.\n\nBy end June, the World Bank expects to be supporting vaccination efforts in 50 countries, two thirds of which are in Africa. The World Bank also has strong partnerships with regional institutions such as the Africa Center for Disease Control, West African Health Organization, and the African Union Commission to enhance cross-border collaboration on disease surveillance, preparedness and response.\n\nThe World Bank-financed COVID-19 vaccine operations allow countries to purchase vaccines through COVAX, through regional initiatives, and through bilateral procurement from manufacturers.\n\nAs such, the Bank has been working closely with AVATT to see that countries in Africa can use World Bank financing to purchase COVID-19 doses through the AVATT initiative as well.",

Odebunmi, Lai Mohammed said that the action of the government was within the extant laws of the land.\n\nHe added that Twitter was not registered in Nigeria and so does not pay taxes as well.\n\nThe Minister however denied that Twitter was not suspended because it deleted Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho is Twitter? We are talking about a sovereign country. Nigeria will not be ruled by the laws of a multinational, no matter how powerful it is. So, for us, why did we act now? There is no time we took the decision that we will not have the kind of reaction we have now. But it has gone to a stage after a persistent appeal to Twitter, and we saw how policemen were being killed, soldiers and we said enough is enough. We owe no responsibility to Twitter. It\u2019s not registered in Nigeria. It does not employ any Nigerians or pay taxes. There are other platforms available to Nigerians to make money.\n\n\u201cIn the press release, we also said henceforth, all OTT must register first as Nigerian companies and be licensed by the Broadcasting Commission before they can carry out business as social media platforms. We realized that many of the OTT social media platforms operating in Nigeria today are not registered in Nigeria. They make billions of naira out of our country. They pay no taxes. They employed nobody. That\u2019s why we said we are going to suspend Twitter and at the same time all other social media platforms that are not registered in Nigeria must register.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s true that many Nigerians have accused the FG of an attempt to stifle the media and the free speech and we say no at all. There is absolutely no intention on the part of the government to stifle free speech or the media because as you will see, why it is true that section 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41of the constitution actually provide for freedom of speech, but it is actually qualified by Section 45 of the same constitution.\n\n\u201cHon. Members, like I, said the only reason we suspended the operation of Twitter is that it was promoting disunity in Nigeria and it became a national security risk. As you can see the provision of the constitution leaves no one in doubt that the provisions on freedom of expression are not absolute.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the circumstances of section 3 of the national security act which clothes the State Security Service with the powers to preserve the internal security of Nigeria is very instructive that any platforms that threaten the internal security of Nigeria will not be allowed to operate.\n\n\u201cThis is a case where the federal government deemed it necessary that the activities of Twitter in Nigeria were inimical to the stability of the country.\n\n\u201cHon members, may I remind you that during the unfortunate #EndSARS# protest, the same played a very unsacred role by making available its platform to retweet, not just the retweeting the messages of EndSARS protesters, but raising funds for the EndSARS protesters before it was hijacked by hoodlums. And Nigerians have forgotten that this particular EndSARS protests led to the death of 57 civilians, 37 policemen, 6 soldiers, 243 properties destroyed, 200 brand new buses belonging to Lagos State government, 83 warehouses were vandalized and yet Jack Dorsey crowd-funded the activities. That\u2019s I said that the Twitter mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\n\u201cHon. Members, we all know that IPOB is proscribed by the high court of law in Nigeria and yet it is a platform of choice through which IPOB directs its people to kill soldiers, policemen, to burn correctional centers. So both in practice and common law, we had to suspend their operations.\n\n\u201cI will round up by even the position of Companies Allied Act also supports the suspension of Twitters operations in Nigeria because the primary laws governing businesses in Nigeria is the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020. Twitter is not licensed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are within the law to suspend Twitter. Our position is also supported by cyber space security act.\n\n\u201cArticle 19(2&3) of the International convention on civil and political rights of the Cyber crimes prohibitions act empowers the federal government of Nigeria to regulate and promote the security of the Nigerian cyberspace.\n\n\u201cI want to make two clarifications. The first is that we did not ban Twitter. We simply suspended indefinitely the activities of Twitter. The second, we did not suspend the activities of Twitter because they deleted Mr. President\u2019s tweet. No at all. We were very unambiguous on why we suspended Twitter.\n\n\u201cYes, we have taken into consideration Nigerians doing business on Twitter. It is because there is a country called Nigeria that people can do business on any platform. And this is very fundamental. There are other platforms. Facebook, google, WhatsApp for people to use. But in a matter of national security, individual interest will lag behind.\n\n\u201cWe said the doors are not banned. We are ready to speak with twitter. Twitter has written a letter seeking for government dialogue and just today, I issued a statement which I announced the government team that is ready to meet Twitter chaired by my humble self with the Minister of Justice, Communication, Works and Housing, Labour and some agencies of government. We hope that the Commitee will move fast and have dialogue and understanding with Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe OTT must be registered as Nigerian companies after which they will be licensed.\u201d\n\nThe minister however hoped that the face-off will be resolved soon.\n\n\u201cHopefully, if we were able to resolve this matter quickly, they will resume the use of Twitter\u201d, he said.\n\nLai Mohammed also advised Nigerians using VPN to stop for their own personal security.\n\nAccording to him, VPN would expose even their bank account and make it vulnerable.\n\nThe minister added that the government will also suspend any other social media platforms that may misbehave\n\n\u201cIf any plaftorm does it, we will suspend their operations too because there is country called Nigeria that they can do business\u201d, he said.\n\nIn his remarks earlier, a member of the Committee, Hon. Fatihu Mohammed who represents Daura Sandamu Baure federal constituency of Katsina State, while supporting the twitter ban asked Nigerians to jettison social media.\n\nHe said \u201cMy colleagues have spoken the minds of their Constituencies. If I will speak the mind of my Constituency, I will include the President himself inside because out of 360 of us, I am the only one voted by the president. Let\u2019s put Nigeria first and lets call a spade a spade. The media is at war. We can see what is happening in social media. I have worked in NCC for 10 years. I know what the department, cybercrime. We should please, regulate the media. If that tweet was not brought down, the dirty things will happen in Nigeria will be less than what we are seeing now because if the minister did not ban Twitter by the instruction of Mr. President, the kind of insults the sovereignty of Nigeria will have by the users of tweet will be more dangerous than what we are facing now. Let\u2019s tell ourselves the truth. Nigeria first. Sometimes, I am reading tweets, I am disappointed with the youths and the future.\n\n\u201cI went to a unity school, Federal Government College, Kwali. When south east are coming, we lined up shouting that they are coming with their buses. But that thing is missing. Why are we bringing issues, trying to cause confusion where there is no confusion? It\u2019s just interest. For God\u2019s sake, what is social media? Are we eating social media? Let\u2019s go back to the resources and have it, my brothers. Let\u2019s keep this thing outside and face the real problem we are facing in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Chairman of the Committee said the investigation was necessary to know the circumstances of the suspension hence the interface with the Minister.\n\nHe promised further legislative action on the matter.",

          "title": "Buhari, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF clash over appointments",
          "text": "By Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Romanus Okoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has defended his appointments and policies, saying they are fair and inclusive.\n\nHe was apparently reacting to the gale of criticisms against his alleged lopsided appointment which critics say favour one part of the country.\n\nBuhari said there was no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\n\nHe spoke at the All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Conference with the theme: \u201cThe future is a decision.\u201d\n\nThe conference, first of its kind in the history of the APC was attended by youths representatives from across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nHe maintained that the party would keep implementing and executing policies that were not only beneficial but fair to all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo far, all the policies initiatives, projects and even appointments by this administration has been guided by equity and inclusiveness. There is actually no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\u201d\n\nHe explained that what an area lacked in one aspect was compensated for in another.\n\nHowever, the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chijioke Okoli faulted the President Buhari\u2019s claim.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said the administration has been most unfair in terms of appointments and policies.\n\n\u201cThere has never been an administration in this country that is as unfair and alienates certain parts of the country as that of President Buhari. For Buhari to claim he is fair shows he is unaware of the feelings of the Nigerian public. It seems certain English words connote a different meaning to president Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nOhanaeze\u2019s scribe, Alex Chidozie Ogbonna, agued that the lopsidedness is not just in favour of the north but the Fulani extraction, which he said gives great concern to even the northerners.\n\nHe said after his election in 2015, he did not hide his disdain for the South East when he said those who gave him 97 percent would not be treated the same way as those who gave him five per cent.\n\n\u201cAnd true to his pronouncement, his administration has been skewed against the South East that didn\u2019t give him much electoral support in 2015. But even when the zone supported him in 2019, the trend did not change. So, he can\u2019t say his appointments and policies have been fair and inclusive. I disagree with him on that.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said if the president was right in his claims, people would not complain about his administration.He noted that the president has been so nepotistic in all his political appointments so much that every important organisation in Nigeria is headed by a northern Muslim.\n\n\u201cThe president is not just nepotistic in his appointments and policies, he also has an agenda which favours what he wants to protect. I don\u2019t want to say he lied, but the data is there for everybody to see. Nearly all appointments, even in some states where the Fulani population is insignificant like in Nasawara and Taraba, are taken by the Fulani. There is nepotism in Buhari\u2019s government, which has never been experienced in Nigeria before now. So, let him change. Nigerians don\u2019t hate him; it is his policies that Nigerians don\u2019t like. It is his policies that are creating all the problems we are having today. It is his policies that are making people say they are no longer interested in this country.\u201d\n\nOkoli (SAN) equally disagreed with the president, saying if the president said his appointments and policies are fair and inclusive, then he is not just habituating in an alternate universe but has also taken his audience to the theatre of the absurd.\n\n\u201cAnd in such theatre, you are torn between laughing and crying. The disingenuousness is beyond belief. He had earlier acknowledged the lopsided nature of his appointments but justified them on the basis of merit. It is a village idiot that would believe him in his embarrassing appointment of some of the least qualified from a section of the country, which are, in the first place, disadvantaged educationally, in the presence of qualified manpower.\u201d\n\nFor Dr Ezeife, President Buhari\u2019s appointments are motivated by blood relationship while his policies are driven by love and hatred.\n\n\u201cHe hates the South East and to a lesser extent the South-South. He loves Niger Republic even though it is not part of Nigeria. He loves Muslims and hates Christians. It is not possible for him to say his appointments and policies are fair and equitable. I can\u2019t believe he can say such a thing but if indeed he said so, then something is wrong, too wrong for correction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Criminal elements\u2019ll be brought to book\n\n\u2013President\n\nNotwithstanding the criticisms, Buhari has reassured that no effort would be spared in tackling insecurity in the country and bringing its perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, we are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them.\n\n\u201cAs I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly.\n\n\u201cI am happy to see that we are beginning to see the results and we keep improving until the country is rid of such divisive elements,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari implored Nigerians not to be discouraged or relent in the joint task of nation building.\n\nHe stressed that we have no other country but Nigeria, adding that it was the responsibility of everyone to work toward the development and advancement of the country.\n\nHe advised that unpleasant experiences and controversies of the past should be put behind, as we forge a better future for the country.\n\nThis, he added, could be achieved through patience, perseverance, love and empathy for one another irrespective of tribe, language and religion.\n\nBuhari also gave assurance that the APC would remain bound by the tenets of its manifesto and constitution.\n\nHe noted that while the party`s constitution and manifesto might not be perfect, they were put together to ensure that elected and appointed members of the party conducted themselves in the most responsible manner possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has said her faith in younger generation of Nigerian women and youths remained unshakable.\n\nRepresented by her Senior Special Assistant on Women Affairs and Administration, Dr Rukayyatu Gurin, the first lady expressed her unalloyed support and commitment to the party.",

          "text": "By Alex Enumah\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court on Tuesday, ordered the federal government to pay a total sum of over $3.3 billion to both Rivers and Akwa Ibom States, being their share of revenue from crude oil sales.\n\nJustice Taiwo made the order while delivering judgment in the suit jointly instituted by the two states to demand their share from the $62 billion the federal government had claimed it recovered from the sales of crude oil.\n\nThe judge, who held that the case of the plaintiffs was meritorious, ordered the federal government to pay the sum of $1,114,551,610 to Rivers State, while another sum of $2,258,411,586 be paid to Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe amount represents what the two states separately claimed against the federal government as their share from the $62 billion recovered from the oil companies.\n\nWhile the Attorneys General of Rivers and Akwa Ibom States are plaintiffs in the suit, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice was the sole defendant.\n\nIn the judgment, which lasted over an hour, the court held that the federal government by its refusal to defend the case when served with the court processes, admitted the monetary claims of the two states against it.\n\nAccording to him, the mere notice of intention to defend the case without joining issues with the plaintiffs was a fatal error on the part of the federal government and was not enough in any court matter.\n\nBy refusing to debunk, counter claim or controvert the claims of the two states on the oil revenue issue, the judge held that the federal government had admitted all the averments of the two states are true.\n\nJustice Taiwo further held that the suit of the two states was founded on a Supreme Court judgment on how proceeds from sales of crude oil should be shared, adding that the claim of the two states on the recovery of additional $62 billion by the plaintiffs was never controverted by the defendant, in spite of several correspondences hence, the law deems unchallenged claims as true.\n\nJustice Taiwo, in addition, rejected the assertion of the federal government that it cannot pay the money it did receive from crude oil sales, adding that the defendant ought to have filed bonafide defence to explain its position in respect of the $62 billion oil earnings as required by law.\n\n\u201cBy not filing defence to challenge the claims of $62 billion oil earnings of the two plaintiffs, I have no option than to hold that the federal government has no defence to the issue and I have no discretion to give judgment in favour of the plaintiffs.\n\n\u201cI hereby make an order that $1,114,551,610 be paid to Rivers State as its share from the $62 billion oil revenue and another $2,258,411,586 be also paid to Akwa Ibom as its own share from the oil proceeds,\u201d the judge said.\n\nThe two plaintiffs had instituted their joint cade based on a press statement from the office of the AGF and published by THISDAY Newspaper to the effect that another $62 billion was recovered from foreign oil companies as proceeds of crude oil sales.\n\nJustice Taiwo held that although, the AGF office attempted to withdraw the press statement, the issue of the huge revenue generation was not addressed.\n\nThe judge subsequently held that the federal government actually recovered the said $62 billion as contained in the press statement and ordered it to release the shares of the two states to them in compliance with a Supreme Court judgment.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

In the case marked FCT/HR/CR/76/13, Lawan was alleged to have demanded the sum of $3 million for himself from the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Zenon Petroleum and Gas Limited, Otedola. He was alleged to have collected $620,000 out of the amount with a view to removing Otedola\u2019s company\u2019s name from the list of firms indicted by the ad hoc committee for allegedly abusing the fuel subsidy regime in 2012.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Lagos state government says most of the injuries sustained by protesters at the Lekki tollgate were from machete cuts and stampede.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHakeem Muri-Okunola, head of service, stated this on Tuesday, when he appeared before the Lagos judicial panel on police brutality to represent the state government.\n\nMuri-Okunola came to the panel to present a timeline of the activities of the Lagos state government during the #EndSARS protests, including the Lekki tollgate shooting.\n\nThe head of service noted that the state government established an ad-hoc committee, referred to as the incident command centre, during the protests to monitor the security situation in Lagos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said when Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, visited Reddington hospital and General hospital, Marina, on October 21, 2020, it was discovered that 25 patients were receiving treatment in the two hospitals.\n\n\u201cDue to the monitoring activities of the incident command centre, we were informed that there were indeed casualties in some of our hospitals in Lagos. There were more than other places \u2014 based on our feedback and information monitoring \u2014 in Reddington hospital on Admiralty way, and in General hospital, Marina,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGetting to about 10:30pm (on October 20, 2020), the governor then decided that we should go out to see what was going on for ourselves \u2014 a decision that his core security personnel rejected outrightly as unsafe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt about 12:30am, 21st October \u2014 we have crossed to midnight now \u2014 because of the number of people that were reported to have been in Reddington hospital, the governor, against the said security advice, decided to visit and see what was going on at the toll plaza, the Reddington hospital and General hospital, Lagos.\n\n\u201cIn this Reddington hospital, these individuals were injured in that axis.

          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda, with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Apollo, a Kenya-based agritech startup, has received $1 million in debt financing to support small-scale farmers. This was led by Agri-Business Capital (ABC) Fund.\n\nThis is coming after the agritech startup raised $6 million in Series A funding in May 2020, led by Anthemis Exponential Ventures. Other investors that participated in that round were Leaps by Bayer, Flourish Ventures, Sage Hill Capital, and Accion Venture Lab, among others.\n\nThe Agritech startup had raised over $10 million in seed capital, a debt round of over $460,000 in 2018, and $6 million in Series A funding in 2020.\n\nThe Nairobi-based agritech startup was founded in 2015 by Eli Pollak, Chief Executive Officer (CEO); Benjamin Njenga, Chief Customer Officer (CCO); and Earl Suaver, Chief Technological Officer (CTO) to help Kenyan farmers maximise their profits by providing services like financing, farming inputs, advice, and insurance to small-scale farmers.\n\nApollo uses machine learning and automated operations technology to help farmers access these services.\n\nIt also deploys machine learning models to assess if customers are creditworthy. And if they pass this assessment, they receive a voucher code via a text message to redeem their credit.\n\nHowever, Apollo doesn\u2019t give farmers credit in cash. Instead, credit is offered in seeds and fertiliser, which they are expected to repay in cash after harvest.\n\nPollak said that the funding would help Apollo to continue to support small-scale farmers and enable them to access its services. This will lead to a significant increase in their yields and income.\n\nThe agritech startup acquires customers through digital marketing channels, and it onboards them via its app through a network of over 1,200 field agents across Kenya.\n\nDespite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the startup claims to have grown its customer base by three times in the last year. Currently, Apollo says it serves 60,000 farmers.\n\nAlthough most farmers grow maize, the startup plans to launch new crops and products that will prompt them to grow other varieties for profitable and commercial farming. While it\u2019s not clear why Apollo chose debt financing over equity financing like angel investments and strategic partnerships, the former does not give investors an ownership stake. And it\u2019s a less expensive source of capital, especially if the company is growing at a high rate.",

Launched on Monday, June 21, 2021, this feature has only been rolled out in the US, and for now, is only available on iOS.\n\nOnly verified creators or public figures in good standing with Facebook, select Facebook groups, and an initial set of US podcast hosts can host a room, while listeners are unlimited in number, and can be iOS or Android users.\n\nOne wonders how different these features are from Clubhouse\u2019s existing model. Facebook\u2019s audio feature allows listeners to react to content while streaming and support creators by sending stars which can be purchased during a conversation.\n\nAlso, hosts can organise a nonprofit or fundraiser amidst conversations, and listeners can make donations directly.\n\nFor decorum, admins can control whether moderators, group members, or other admins can create a live audio room. Private groups are restricted to only group members, and users can use a \u201craise hand\u201d tool to request to speak.\n\nFacebook is also rolling out a planned podcast support for a set of handpicked celebrity creators in the US. The feature will be made available to regular podcasters this summer.\n\nLast week, we reported that Spotify launched Greenroom, enabling users to convert live-audio conversations to podcasts.\n\nNo surprise, as this would help more Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces users to revisit conversations easily.\n\nWith the latest trend of social media giants tapping into audio live features, I wonder if it\u2019s just a fad or something that\u2019s here to stay.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n3 steps to register your small business with CAC online\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nWhat do debates on Twitter reveal about identity?

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Tuesday, signed a consultancy service agreement with engineering firm, Siraj Nigeria Limited, for Edo regional development and Benin urban master plan.\n\nObaseki, shortly after signing the agreement at the Government House, Benin City, said the plan will ensure a defined template for development and growth in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe signing of consultancy service agreement for Edo Regional Development Plan and Benin Urban Master Plan is indeed another milestone. The last time an exercise like this was conducted was up to a generation ago.\n\n\u201cMajority of the people living in Edo today have lived without a master plan: That largely explains the seeming confusion and disorder you are seeing in our physical space. Since 1918, we have had plans in Benin, so planning is not new to us as a people.\n\n\u201cIn the last 30 years or so, we have stopped planning and so, the event today is very significant to us as it is going to help us reconnect our past with where we are coming from. This exercise is not the one you are coming to plan for us; know that you are going to guide us.\n\n\u201cThis exercise is not the one you are going to give us a set of documents; you are going to guide us as we develop our own plans for the future. You are up to date on the tool that is required in undertaking this kind of exercise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to put in more than 100 professionals in this exercise, so that you have more human resources to do the things you need to do. For us, these plans are very important,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cEdo is growing at a very rapid rate; everybody cannot build a house in the city, which is why the regional plan is very important; we can now plan for other major centers.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of this plan, we have to redefine land use and do it properly, so that we know the areas that we are leaving for agriculture, industries and those for residential, among others.\u201d\n\nReassuring on the realisation of a Museum in Benin to house returned artifacts, Obaseki added: \u201cEdo is the cultural hub of Africa. Thank God for the progress and achievement we have made in the return of some of our artifacts that were taken away from Benin over a 100 years ago. We need to beautify the city to receive these works by building an iconic museum to receive them.\n\n\u201cYou know that the museum has refined many cities in the world and that is the type of aspiration that we have; we are hoping that this exercise will be able to help fix other crisis that we face in terms of infrastructure.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of Siraj, Kamal Azor, said the plan is not just focusing on Benin metropolis alone, but captures rural communities and villages with their peculiar needs.\n\n...",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "The Senate on Tuesday received a supplementary appropriation bill from President Muhammadu Buhari to approve the sum of N895.842,465,917 billion as supplementary budget for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nThe bill was transmitted with a letter dated 15th June, 2021, and addressed to the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nPresident Buhari, in the letter which was read during the commencement of plenary, explained that the amount captured was proposed to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\n\nHe added that part of the supplementary budget would be used to also fund health related expenditures for treatment of additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Program in states; as well as to procure additional equipment captured in this year\u2019s capital expenditure on Defence and Security to tackle prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cLet me seize this opportunity, to express my deep gratitude, for the cooperation and support, of the Leadership and Distinguished Members of the Senate, in our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic and address the various security and other challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cIt has become necessary to prepare the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill considering the urgent need to make provision for procurement and administration of COVlD-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe availability of COVlD-19 vaccines and the procurement terms were still uncertain as at the time of finalising the 2021 budget. Hence, there was no provision in the 2021 Appropriation Act for the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) have now developed a Covid-19 vaccine programme for the country. Under the vaccine programme, 70% of eligible Nigerians are to be vaccinated between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our security and law enforcement agencies urgently need to procure additional equipment and other resources in response to the prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence has carefully scrutinized these procurement needs, which the military authorities claim to represent the minimum requirements to secure our country and address current external and internal security challenges.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, additional funds are required to meet our commitment to treat additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Program in States (NCAPS), as the amount provisioned in the 2021 Appropriation Bill for this purpose was inexplicably cut by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the urgent problem of oxygen availability in the country and avoid the potential loss of lives, provision was made for the procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to provide additional funds for Public Service wage Adjustment to cater for sundry wage-related issues in the health and other sectors, which if not resolved can add to the prevalent sense of instability in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe Supplementary Budget request is for a total sum of N895, 842, 465, 917 (Eight Hundred and Ninety-\u2018Five Billion, Eight Hundred and Forty-Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Five Thousand, Nine Hundred and Seventeen Naira) only.\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund N45.63 billion of the N83.56 billion required for the COVlD-19 vaccine programme by drawing on existing World Bank loans (which would be restructured) as well as Other Grants totalling US$113.22 million.\n\n\u201cThe balance of N37.93 billion required for COVlD-19 vaccines, salaries and other health-related expenditures totalling N41.69 billion and the N48.20 billion recurrent component of defence/security expenditure will be funded by drawing N135 billion from some Special Reserve/Levy Accounts, which will be captured as revenues to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund the balance of N722.40 billion for capital expenditure on defence/security and capital supplementation from new borrowings, in the absence of any supplementary revenue sources.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, needs currently abound in many other sectors. However, we have limited the supplementary budget proposal to just these critical and emergency areas of need due to our severe fiscal constraints.\n\n\u201cAll other needs would be deferred to the 2022 budget, which we plan to present in September of this years.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerians scored a major victory against the Buhari government on Tuesday over the suspension of Twitter and the threat to prosecute the users.\n\nECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja in a landmark ruling in the case filed by SERAP and 176 Nigerians restrained the government of President Muhammadu Buhari and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions on Twitter users and the provider.\n\nThe ruling barred the regime from imposing any sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s), media houses, radio and television broadcast stations, the Plaintiffs and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of this suit.\n\nThe 177 plaintiffs sued the government arguing that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalization of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana SAN, and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\n\u201cThe court has listened very well to the objection by Nigeria. The court has this to say. Any interference with Twitter is viewed as inference with human rights, and that will violate human rights. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\n\u201cThe court also hereby orders that the application be heard expeditiously. The Nigerian government must take immediate steps to implement the order.\u201d\n\nReacting to the ruling, Femi Falana, SAN said: \u201cThe intervention of the ECOWAS Court is a timely relief for millions of Nigerians using Twitter who have been threatened with prosecution under the provision of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to the assurance credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN that violators of the Twitter would not be prosecuted, the Federal Government filed processes in the ECOWAS Court threatening to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter for violating the suspension under the provisions of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is extremely embarrassing that the Federal Government could threaten to jail Nigerians for sedition, which was annulled by the Court of Appeal in 1983, in the case of Arthur Nwankwo vs The State.\u201d\n\nThe suit and the ruling followed the suspension of Twitter on June 5 by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed after the social media giant was banned in the country for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) also ordered TV and radio stations to \u201csuspend the patronage of Twitter immediately\u201d, and told them to delete \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 Twitter.\n\nThe substantive suit has been adjourned till 6 July 2021 for hearing.\n\nSERAP and the concerned Nigerians had in the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 sought \u201cAn order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d",

Igboho, whose real name is Sunday Adeyemo, has sworn to hold the planned \u201cYoruba Nation\u201d gathering in Lagos\u2019 Ojota Park.\n\nIghoho who said he had held similar peaceful rallies in Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Ekiti, said nobody could stop the agitators from storming Lagos. Chairman of APC UK, Dr Phillip Idaewor, in a statement on Tuesday, said there were other ways for the group to channel their agitations rather than engage in a rally that might be hijacked by hoodlums to unleash terror on Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cWe are not opposed to the ideas of making Nigeria work better for the many and not the few. Indeed our party promised restructuring of Nigeria in our manifesto and it is our view that this remains the best course of action to reclaim the narrative from citizens who now feel alienated both from the government and country.\n\n\u201cConsidering the state of insecurity that the government is battling across the country, we feel that the rally is ill-timed. No doubt, people have rights all over the world to peaceful protests but the situation in the country is such that all efforts must be geared to stop any gathering or association that may further worsen the security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cLagos as the commercial nerve centre in Nigeria needs to be protected from the possibility of any planned protests which can be hijacked to cause destruction of businesses and state infrastructure. Lagos is home to Nigerians of all tribes across the country.\n\n\u201cWe urge Yoruba youths and supporters of Ighoho to encourage him to pull back on this mission as it may lead to loss of lives and destruction of property. Our main concern is about our Lagos.\n\n\u201cSo far, Lagos has been peaceful and the peaceful coexistence amongst Nigerians in the state must be preserved no matter what it takes,\u201d he said.\n\nIdaewor urged leaders of thought and Yoruba elders to continue to engage with the leadership of Yoruba youths, including Igboho to ensure that he did not lead innocent youths on any unnecessary project of destruction.\n\n\u201cWe believe in one Nigeria and we must not allow those calling for its breakup to tear us apart irrespective of challenges currently faced by the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that a politically just and equitable Nigerian state would be an asset to Nigerians and the black race.\n\n\u201cThis is the historical beckoning to Nigerians to keep working hard towards a united country.\n\n\u201cAs diaspora Nigerians we know from the experience of mixing with people from around the world, that Africa more than ever before, needs Nigeria to become a strong, stable and prosperous country.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, continue to encourage dialogue between the government and the people to identify and resolve our country\u2019s intractable political problems,\u201d he added.",

The latest average is around 850,000 daily shots.\n\nAdult vaccination rates vary greatly by state. The Northeast has some of the highest uptake, with Vermont leading the charge at 84 percent partially vaccinated and 75 percent fully vaccinated.\n\nThe bottom of the table is dominated by states in the South, with Mississippi covering just 45 percent of adults with one shot and 37 percent with two.\n\nAccording to nationally representative surveys carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation, unvaccinated adults are significantly younger, less educated, more likely to be Republicans, people of color and uninsured.\n\nDespite missing the Independence Day goal, Zients said the administration had \u201csucceeded beyond our highest expectations\u201d in returning the nation to a pre-pandemic normal.\n\n\u201cInstead of just small backyard gatherings, America is getting ready for a truly historic Fourth of July, with large celebrations planned in communities across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added the White House would invite 1,000 people including military and frontline workers to celebrate the holiday at an outdoor party.\n\nFederal indoor mask recommendations were lifted for vaccinated people in May and cases are at their lowest since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe country is registering around 10,000 new daily cases a day \u2014 just three per 100,000 people, with the daily death rate around 270, or 0.1 per 100,000.\n\nStill, epidemiologists are worried about the rise of the Delta variant, which is more transmissible than past strains and badly hit India, Britain and other countries. It now accounts for at least 20 percent of US cases.\n\nCurrent vaccines remain effective against the variant if a person is fully vaccinated, but there are fears that undervaccinated parts of the country could incubate new waves.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "ECOWAS Court Stops Nigeria Government From Sanctioning, Prosecuting Twitter Users",
          "text": "The ECOWAS Court of Justice has \u201crestrained the government of President Muhammadu Buhari and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s), media houses, radio and television broadcast stations, the Plaintiffs and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of this suit.\u201d\n\nThe ruling by the regional court in Abuja followed the suit filed against the government by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians arguing that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalization of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana, and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\nThe court said: \u201cThe court has listened very well to the objection by Nigeria. The court has this to say. Any interference with Twitter is viewed as inference with human rights, and that will violate human rights. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to hear the case. The court also hereby orders that the application be heard expeditiously. The Nigerian government must take immediate steps to implement the order.\u201d\n\nThis development was disclosed today by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Femi Falana said: \u201cThe intervention of the ECOWAS Court is a timely relief for millions of Nigerians using Twitter who have been threatened with prosecution under the provision of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to the assurance credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN that violators of the Twitter would not be prosecuted, the Federal Government filed processes in the ECOWAS Court threatening to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter for violating the suspension under the provisions of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is extremely embarrassing that the Federal Government could threaten to jail Nigerians for sedition, which was annulled by the Court of Appeal in 1983, in the case of Arthur Nwankwo vs The State.\u201d\n\nThe suit and the ruling followed the suspension of Twitter by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed after the social media giant was banned in the country for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet. The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) also ordered TV and radio stations to \u201csuspend the patronage of Twitter immediately\u201d, and told them to delete \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 Twitter.\n\nThe substantive suit has been adjourned to July 6 for hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nIt would be recalled that SERAP and the concerned Nigerians had in the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 sought \u201cAn order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d",
