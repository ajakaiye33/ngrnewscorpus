Gboyega Oyetola of Osun and Alhaja Noimot Salako, Ogun Deputy Governor, have urged Muslims to embrace peaceful coexistence.\n\nThey made the plea on Sunday at the opening ceremony of the Islamic Vacation Course (IVC) held at the Muslim Students Society of Nigeria (MSSN), B-Zone IVC Permanent Site on Ibadan-Lagos Expressway.\n\nREAD ALSO:Christmas: Reps\u2019 minority caucus not happy Nigerians can\u2019t afford basic needs of life\n\nRecall that the Society was established on April 18, 1954 in Lagos.\n\nThe theme for the 111th edition of the IVC entitled \u201cHow Could This Be\u201d was targeted at examining issues affecting Islam and how it could be addressed.\n\nThe Sultan, represented by Alhaji Abdur-Rasaq Oladejo, admonished the students to eschew violence, urging them to be constructive in their presentations and agitations.\n\nAbubakar urged them to be peaceful and good ambassadors of Islam, whether in schools, homes, social events or wherever they find themselves.\n\n\u201cAs we are going into the New Year, we all know the security situation of Nigeria, we should continue to pray for peace.\n\n\u201cWe must pray to overcome insurgency in Nigeria and also for the New Year to be good for all of us Muslims and non-Muslims,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, commended the contributions of MSSN leadership to the country through their dawah activities in schools and national education.\n\nOyetola, also represented by his Special Adviser on Education, Mr Jamiu Olawunmi, admonished participants to use the opportunity in renewing their faiths and reawakening their spiritual life.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you all to always propagate good virtues and also propose to all tolerance as well as peaceful coexistence, regardless of our geopolitical zones, ethnic or religious practice,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting, Mrs Noimot Salako, the Deputy Governor of Ogun, congratulated the MSSN on the 111th IVC programme, urging them to remain committed to the propagation of sound morals.\n\nSalako admonished participants not to adopt divisive attitude or confrontation in achieving their goals, advising them to find a way of forming consensus.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we always cooperate to help ourselves. We must not always see things as conflicts at all times.\n\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters, another election circle is coming. We don\u2019t have to go for elective positions to be relevant in politics.\n\n\u201cLet us all play our parts. Let us lend our voice to candidates. Let us support candidates who will not fail. Let\u2019s support candidates that will help us achieve all that we want,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his lecture, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, the Secretary-General, Nigeria Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), said there was no time to waste in achieving their mandates.\n\nOloyede, represented by Dr AbdulWahab Oyedokun, said that Allah had endowed them with intellect, knowledge, resources and wealth to fix their challenges.\n\nHe urged Muslims to propel the ummah to greater heights as well as prioritise education of youths and moral rebirth.\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen our capacity for managing ideological differences.\n\n\u201cThose of us in government and public service at both the centre and sub-national levels must re-dedicate ourselves to the plights of the masses.\n\n\u201cWe must invest in Islamic schools, be dedicated to reducing poverty and social exclusion of Muslims, among others,\u201d he said.\n\nOloyede said it was imperative to examine the socio-political balance sheet of Nigeria with a view to determining the role expected of Muslims in the continual reconstruction of the society.\n\nHe said that the nation was beset with a number of challenges, traceable to poor social engineering as a result of breakdown of family values.\n\n\u201cWe owe ourselves the primary obligation of self-appraisal. As Allah\u2019s creatures, it is important to make a critical evaluation of our life\u2019s journey; to ask ourselves questions whether we are actually on course,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Retired CP Olayinka Balogun, in his lecture \u201cPrevalence of Insecurity in Nigeria and Its Effect on Human Conduct\u201d said that absence of good governance could perpetrate or cause multidimensional insecurity problems.\n\nHe listed causes of insecurity as weak and incapable government, corruption, politics of hatred, unemployment, general discrimination, impunity as well as breakdown of traditional institutions.\n\nBalogun said that there was need for people to rise and ask those in authority to do the needful.\n\n\u201cWe have worshipped and obeyed the government, let there arise amongst you now to advise, call on, admonish those in authority to fight corruption, lethargy and open audacity.\n\n\u201cThey should teach deterrence, punish impunities and openly admonish; that is how to fight and curb insecurity, food, life, employment, freedom of movement as well as association,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Mr Qaasim Odedeji, the Amir/Coordinator, MSSN B-Zone, cautioned those in authorities, as well as individuals, especially religious bigots not to use their positions to infringe on the fundamental rights of Muslim students.",

          "text": "By Chris Njoku, Owerri, Okodili Ndidi and Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\nMy wife, daughter humiliated, says ex-governor\n\nImo govt: we have no hand in Police operation\n\nThe Imo State Government and the Senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday traded words over the arrest of the 2019 governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) Chief Uche Nwosu.\n\nNwosu, who is also Okorocha\u2019s son-in-law, was arrested at St. Peter\u2019s Anglican Church, Eziama-Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area of the state by policemen in connection with \u201ca case that is under investigation.\u201d\n\nThe manner of his arrest had triggered rumours that he was kidnapped until the Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Michael Abattam, clarified that he was arrested, following an order from above.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was alleged that \u201cgunmen\u201d stormed the church during the outing service of Nwosu\u2019s mother, Jemamah Nwosu, and shot sporadically into the air.\n\nAssociates also alleged that the \u201cgunmen\u201d bundled the politician into the trunk of a waiting vehicle before speeding away..\n\nBut Okorocha, who said his wife, Nnenna, and daughter, Uloma Nwosu, were in the church when the operation took place, said Governor Hope Uzodimma \u201dis 100 per cent responsible\u201d for the arrest of Nwosu.\n\n\u201cHope Uzodimma deceived Abuja for the arrest of Uche Nwosu. Hope Uzodinma is 1,000 per cent responsible for the arrest. It is either Uzodinma is the IGP (Inspector-General of Police) or the governor of Imo State,\u201d he told reporters at his Owerri residence.\n\nThe former governor, who claimed that his son-in-law was \u201cdragged into a bus carrying Imo State Government number,\u201d said he did not know his whereabouts.\n\nHe also accused the operatives of humiliating his wife by pushing her down and his daughter by tearing her clothes.\n\nThe former governor, who described the incident as \u201cthe worst humiliation in my life,\u201d said President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cshould be informed about what is happening in Imo State.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cMy wife was pushed down and my daughter\u2019s clothes were torn into pieces by the policemen who came into the church to arrest Uche Nwosu with no warrant of arrest.\n\n\u201cI want to know the offence my son-in-law has committed that they rough handled him because I\u2019m yet to be informed. I have called the Inspector General of Police. His number was switched off. I have called the Commissioner of Police (Hussaini Rabiu). He said the order came from above.\n\n\u201cUche Nwosu, my wife and daughter were at the church for an outing service, when a group of men in police uniform while the sermon was ongoing, started shooting. In the course of their activities, they pushed down my wife and they tore my daughter\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cNo warrant of arrest. No invitation. We suspected kidnapping at first. Many people were injured while running. Uche Nwosu was dragged into a bus carrying Imo State Government plate number.\n\n\u201cThey were identified as policemen from Imo State Government House by their colleagues attached to Uche for the burial. I got the CP who said that IGP approved his arrest.\n\n\u201cThe shock of such arrest without warrant and humiliating members of my family are unfortunate. Most security operatives in Imo State know nothing about the arrest. I don\u2019t know what they framed up. The IGP could only do this on high-level misinformation from Hope Uzodinma.\n\n\u201cOver one hundred gunshots to arrest Uche Nwosu? What kind of ruthless behavior on innocent citizens of Nigeria?\n\n\u201cHope Uzodimma has shown tremendous heat to me and members of my family. Lawmakers who attended the burial were suspended. I am waiting to hear the offence of Uche Nwosu. Recall that Hope Uzodinma said he is going to name sponsors of insecurity in Imo state on January 3.\n\n\u201cI know he has nothing other than to cook up a story. Last time, he ordered my arrest and one security officer ordered me to enter the pick-up vehicle.\n\n\u201cUzodimma wants to frame me up by all means. Uzodinma has to answer for most of the activities going on. Uzodinma must mention the names of those who are responsible for insecurity in Imo State or he should be held responsible for all the killings in the state.\n\n\u201cUzodimma has framed up something against Uche Nwosu. Buhari should be informed about what is happening in Imo state. Hundreds of citizens are been killed in this state.\n\n\u201cHow come it is only Abuja and Imo State government House that know about the arrest. I want to know the reason for the attack on a church and, why Uche Nwosu should be treated like a criminal.\n\nImo State Government should provide answers immediately. You can\u2019t be governor of the people by intimidation\u201d\n\nImo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy Declan Emelumba said Okorocha\u2019s reaction has proved him guilty as \u201dall he wants to do is to whip up sentiments among Imo citizens.\u201d\n\nHe told reporters at the Government House, that the former governor should have waited for the law to take its course before reacting.\n\nEmelumba said: \u201cIf Uche Nwosu is arrested, what he (Okorocha) should do is to wait and see why he was arrested. But he is talking incoherently and that will not save him. What he should do is wait for the law to take its course.\n\n\u201cAll of you went to Orsu and saw the carnage there. I am not saying he is linked to the incident. You also witnessed his statement during his mother-in-law\u2019s burial where he invited youths to protest. All these are evidence of his inciting actions in the state.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner, who denied government\u2019s involvement in the arrest, said: \u201cThe government has no hand in the arrest of Uche Nwosu, but any attempt by Okorocha to use it to cause panic is evidence of guilt and that cannot save him.\n\n\u201cOkorocha contradicted himself when he said that the commissioner of police told him that the order came from the IGP and at the same time he said that the arrest was ordered by the governor. This shows that he is speaking incoherently and that cannot save him.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has condemned the police for arresting Nwosu inside in a church.\n\nIt urged the Police Service Commission (PSC) to investigate the arrest, which it described as an unprofessional conduct.\n\nHURIWA said: \u201dThe reckless and ruthlessly lawless mannerisms displayed by the Imo State Police Command in the vicinity of the church will make it impossible for citizens to separate terrorists from law enforcers because under democracy, the operatives of the law enforcement agencies are bound by rules of civility and law-based approach to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe method adopted by the police violates the Nigerian Police Act of 2020 in which several provisions mandate the police to treat citizens with dignity and to respect their constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights as enshrined in Chapter 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999 as amended.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this criminal tendency by the Imo State Police Command and this has given credence to the report documented by Amnesty International in which the global human rights body accused the command of the use of extrajudicial executions of innocent citizens as their law enforcement tactics. This sort of unprovoked violence and primitive show of force by the Imo State Police Command is unconstitutional, illegal, despicable, treacherous, and reprehensible.\n\n\u201cThis was why everyone in Nigeria believed that the shooters were kidnappers long before the police issued a tepid press statement claiming to have arrested Uche Nwosu.\u201d",
          "summary": "Most security operatives in Imo State know nothing about the arrest.\n\u201cOver one hundred gunshots to arrest Uche Nwosu?\nRecall that Hope Uzodinma said he is going to name sponsors of insecurity in Imo state on January 3.\nEmelumba said: \u201cIf Uche Nwosu is arrested, what he (Okorocha) should do is to wait and see why he was arrested.\nThis sort of unprovoked violence and primitive show of force by the Imo State Police Command is unconstitutional, illegal, despicable, treacherous, and reprehensible.",

We had to leave whatever we were doing to save the situation.\u201d\n\nBut the Director-General of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Abbas Garuba Idriss said: \u201cWe got the distress call around 9:00 in the morning and immediately we activated all the respondents who had been here on time, especially the security agencies to cordon off the place.\u201d\n\nIdriss, who could not ascertain the cause of the fire, officially debunked the rumour that there was looting during the fire incident.\n\n\u201cThe story of looting that you saw online is false. The people that you saw were the members of staff of NEXT cash and carry trying to move their goods from the inferno. This is normal, people are always eager to push fake news. Nothing has gone out of these premises. It is a big store, a lot of losses have been incurred but we cannot really ascertain what has been lost for now, but I am sure the owners will give details of that later. We will further investigate this incident. No casualty. We cannot say the cause of the fire.\u201d\n\nCommissioner of Police FCT, Sunday Babaji also said the security agencies arrived in good time.\n\nThe Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Bello expressed shock and deep sadness over the fire incident.\n\nA statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye said: \u201cThe Minister, on behalf of the FCT Administration and the entire residents of the FCT, commiserates with the management and members of staff of the supermarket and the FCT business community over the unfortunate incident.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command confirmed the arrest of three people over an alleged attempt to steal during the fire incident that engulfed the Next Cash and Carry Supermarket at Jahi District of the FCT.\n\nThe suspects are Ali Audu aged 18 Years; Yahaya Yunusa, 20 and Sahabi Abubakar, 20.\n\nAccording to a statement by the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, an investigation is currently ongoing to ascertain the cause of the fire.\n\nAdah said so far, no casualty has been recorded.\n\nShe said: \u201cToday Thursday, December 26, 2021, at about 11:15 a.m. there was a report of a fire outbreak at Next Cash and Carry Supermarket at Jahi District of the FCT.\n\n\u201cUpon receipt of the information, a team of Police officers attached to Mabushi Police Divisional Headquarters responded swiftly to the scene where a concerted effort of the Federal Fire Service, FCT Fire Service, Julius Berger Fire Service and members of other security agencies were deployed to manage the situation, minimise damage, extinguish the inferno and ensure the maintenance of law and order.\n\n\u201cWell-meaning members of the surrounding communities came out en masse and helped in evacuating goods and other valuables from the supermarket to a safe location within the area with the supervision of police officers of the command that were on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis is contrary to the news getting the rounds as there is no successful case of looting or carting away of goods from the store. The suspects who made attempts to cart away goods from the store and were promptly arrested include were Ali Audu, 18; Yahaya Yunusa, 20; and Sahabi Abubakar, 20.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police FCT Command, CP Sunday Babaji, psc, also visited the scene alongside the Minister for State, FCT, Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, for an on-the-spot assessment and supervision of activities at the scene.\u201d",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nWhen President Muhammadu Buhari announced the approval of 20 per cent salary increase for officers and men of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) on December 15, there was jubilation and mixed reactions not just among the officers, but also the general public.\n\nThe president had through the Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, told state house correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting that the review exercise which would to take effect from January 2022, was in response to the demands made by EndSARS protesters in 2020, primarily on the improvement of welfare for police officers.\n\nHe said that the take-home pay would be enhanced through the duty tour allowance to six per cent of their new take-home pay and an approval of N1.12 billion for payment of outstanding uninsured benefits for the period of 2013 to 2020.\n\nHowever, while many saw the increase as a morale booster for the police to effectively carry out their duties, others feel the salary rise would not make any difference in the rot that has engulfed the force.\n\nFor the records, the last time the police had a review of salary was during the regime of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and since then nothing has been done as far as salary is concerned.\n\nBefore the increase by President Buhari, a police constable earned about N40,000, meaning that with the increase, a police Constable would be going home with about N50,000.\n\nBut while the increment should have been a thing of joy to the rank and file, many are not happy since the increase was not included in the 2022 budget and, therefore, see it as a scam.\n\nSome police officers who spoke to Sunday Sun have mixed feelings about the increase, saying that the problem in the force was more than salary increase.\n\nSome of the officers who do not want their names mentioned in print for fear of being victimized said that though the salary increase was good, there were more pressing needs in the police especially in the areas of logistics, welfare, and others.\n\nMore than the salary increase, many police officers said that they would prefer that government provide them with good healthcare facility, scholarship for their children, good and affordable accommodation, transport system, among other goodies to make their job comfortable.\n\nAn Inspector of police who spoke to Sunday Sun said: \u201cI heard the president has increased our salary by 20 per cent. Of what use is the increase when it is not included in the 2022 budget? I don\u2019t want to believe in this increase of a thing because if you take a very good look at it, it is not different with our old salary.\n\n\u201cThey said they are increasing salary and yet things in the country keep going from bad to worse. Food stuffs are very expensive to the extent that we can no longer afford three square meals for our families.\n\n\u201cTransport fares have skyrocketed, school fees are no go area not to talk of medicals even in our police hospitals.\u201d\n\nAnother personnel, a sergeant, told Sunday Sun that \u201cwe know it is not good to collect bribe from people, but I tell you sometimes we do that because of pressing circumstances.\n\n\u201cImagine you leaving home without giving your wife money to buy food for the family because you sincerely do not have any money and these are some of the things that push one to go into some kind of illegal acts and duties.\u201d\n\nOn how they have been coping with poor salary structure in the service and how it affects their duties and relationship with EndSARS protest, another policeman who craved for anonymity said: \u201cThe #EndSARS protest was a real eye opener to us as policemen. The protest opened our eyes to see that the people can be very powerful if they come together to achieve a just cause.\n\n\u201cThough we did not like the killings of policemen during the protest, it was very clear to us as police personnel that the people were fighting for our good. They saw the rot, the cheating going on in the service and decided to help us, but unfortunately the whole thing went bad and they started to kill and the killings have not stopped till this moment.\n\n\u201cThe lesson I learnt from the whole saga is that there is a limit you can push a person to the wall and you will see the other side of the person and the protest has taught me to be civil in my dealing with people no matter their status.\u201d\n\nFor Inusa Kura, before the #EndSARS protest, most police officers lobby to be posted to the Southeast to work.\n\nBut since after the protest and the current killings af policemen and burning down of police stations in the zone, nobody wants to serve in that region again.\n\nAccording him, \u201cI will say the EndSARS protest has a good and bad effect on policemen especially because of the killings. Before now, a policeman would lobby his way to get posted to the Southeast region of the country because of what we make there, but since after the process, a policeman would call out to cancel his posting to the Southeast, including consulting his village oracle. All these came about as a result of the EndSARS protest\u201d.\n\nFor a retired commissioner of police (names withheld): \u201cIt is not the salary per se that would determine the good conduct of police officers. They have to go back to the drawing board to see how they can think of a holistic welfare package for them. Talking about post retirement housing projects, scholarship scheme for their children, resuscitation of dry ration for patrol teams. A situation where policemen on legal patrol are made to fuel patrol vehicles is not accepted. Buy petrol for patrol vehicles, remove them from the road blocks so that they don\u2019t start seeing all those hardship that they are facing. These are the only things that can stop the #ENDSARS protest.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe easiest place for you to have confrontation with the police is usually at road blocks, except you look for their trouble and go to their police station and they start harassing you. Apart from that, the main platform where they get involved in all those misconducts is road block. So get all those road blocks off, buy more vehicles for them to patrol the highways so that the level of stress within those period of work would be minimize drastically.\n\n\u201cThere is a tipping point for every human being to get fatigued. People are always smarter when their stress level is low, when they have rested, but by the time they pass that level, they become irritated, they become aggressive and any little thing would just trigger them. So those are the areas where I think the government should concentrate on.\n\n\u201cSalary is okay, but if you make a comparative study for salaries around sub-Saharan Africa, you will find out that Nigeria is the lowest. But those things can also be mitigated by putting in place policies that if they don\u2019t adhere to it, they know they are going to lose out.\n\n\u201cFor instance, scholarship for their children, or if they die, there would be scholarship for their children that they left behind. For instance, how many constables get married to highly educated women like journalists, lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other professionals? How many. They always marry people at their own class, their own level because of their poor salary of N40,000 and it means that if anything happens to them, it becomes another morale danger. Their allowances would not come on time, all those are the issues. But once you put into place sanctions and make it clear that they would not be able to access these welfare packages if they go against the rule, they will sit up and stop their irresponsible act.\n\n\u201cSo they must put in place those things that would act as a sanction against bad conduct. That is the only thing that can deter any man from violating such rules. For instance, if you know that your organization is paying the school fees of your children, why would you violate set down rules like bribe taking and getting dismissed from service. I tell you no sane man would do that if he truly loves his children.\n\n\u201cAnother problem in the police force has to do with the orientation of the men. The orientation of the men is a major problem in the force. Salary is okay, but it does not holistically solve all the problems of the police.\n\n\u201cAgain, you cannot be talking about community policing and still having barracks. The barracks are poorly maintained, they are highly unkempt. The police barracks concept is that of the colonial masters where they keep the men and mobilize them at short notices in case of crisis.\n\n\u201cBut the times have changed. There is no where in the world where they have police barracks. They live with the people, their children attend the same school with the people, they go to the same shopping malls, that\u2019s why that way they are forging on and building that trust and breaking the gap.\n\n\u201cGo and look at our police barracks, they are not habitable for any human being. So let\u2019s see if there will be improvement with the salary increase.\u201d\n\nOn his part, a former Inspector General of police, Solomon Arase, wants the government to take another look at the healthcare delivery system in the police especially for the rank and file and their dependants; scholarship for their children, good housing accommodation, among other packages are things that would end up dousing all these negative attitudes.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe that we should look beyond the salaries, we should look at other areas too. It is well for the police to do all those menial jobs for the political elite, but when the chips are down, nobody cares. Look at the way they kill policemen, behead them and do all manner of things to their dead bodies and nobody has been arrested for those gruesome acts.\n\n\u201cScholarship for their children, good healthcare for the rank and file and their dependants if all these are in place and there are infractions , it means that the person automatically loses access to those facilities. I think these would serve as a good conduct. So good health care services for inspectors and rank and file, and review of the various police reforms from 1999 to date.\u201d\n\nAnother policeman, who simply gave his name as Mohammed when asked about the 20 per cent salary increase, told Sunday Sun that he was not aware of it, but that he heard his colleagues talking about it and doubted if it was true or not.\n\nThe police sergeant, who tried to find out from this reporter if the story was true or one of those social media rumors, said: \u201cI heard that the president increased our salary, but that it is not plenty, but I know it is one of those promises and tricks by politicians to confuse us because another election is coming.\n\n\u201cI say it is a truck because I also heard that they did not put the money inside next year\u2019s budget and that is intentional. They purposely removed it from the budget of next year so that they will put it in 2023 and that is an election year to confuse us to go and risk our lives for them to occupy big, big offices.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that my sister, whether they increase our salary or not, it will not change anything because as we speak you know how much they sell gas now?\u201d\n\nFor Dahiru Danjuma, the hardship faced by him and his colleagues since the present administration came to power is unbelievable. Apart from the hardship, he said the number of policemen that have been killed since this administration came to power has never happened in the history of the police.\n\nTo him, the 20 per cent increase is nothing to write home about and should not be something to use to praise the achievements of the Buhari\u2019s government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I heard that government increased our salary by 20 per cent, I laughed because if you look at it for those of us that our salary is less that N40,000, it means what they added is about N8,000. Is that something to be happy about? And another thing again is that we don\u2019t even know if this their increase is for everybody because since the day that I heard it on television nobody has told us anything because they don\u2019t have anything to tell us before they put themselves in trouble with policemen\u201d.\n\nAlso a police inspector who does not want to be mentioned on print said: \u201cI heard about the salary increase, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s for everybody, maybe it is for inspectors and the rank and file. That is what I want to believe because after the announcement by our police minister, I have not heard anything again and that may be because they did not include it in the budget next year.\n\n\u201cBut the truth of the matter is that increasing our salary by 20 per cent, would cause more problem for us because of the harsh economic conditions in the country. I am from the North and grains are our major food because we use it as the people from the East use garri and it used to very cheap because it was sold for as cheap as N80 per mudu. But today a mudu of corn is selling for as high as N500, so tell me what good would the 20 per cent salary increase do to us if not problems.\u201d\n\nBut for Danlami Bukar, \u201cthe salary increase is a good thing by the Buhari\u2019s government and I want to thank him very well. If other presidents have been increasing the salaries of policemen, the rot that we have in our system today would have been reduced. But I want to beg the president to please include it in next year\u2019s budget so that we can smile like the politicians.\u201d",

God does not discriminate in his blessings. The Bible says that he causes the rain to fall and the sun to shine on the good and the evil alike. He makes sure that He blesses everyone. And on this special occasion, I believe that every Nigerian should receive this great blessing that God has for us,\u201d Osinbajo said, adding, \u201cI believe that we are entering into a season of God\u2019s great blessings of peace and prosperity and all shall be well with our country, in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nSimilarly sounding upbeat in his Christmas message, Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun urged Nigerians to remain prayerful as the current challenges facing the nation would soon be a thing of the past.\n\nGovernor Abiodun made the call at a church service held at the St. James\u2019 Anglican Church, Iperu-Remo, Ikenne Local Government Area yesterday. Noting that the country\u2019s present challenges were surmountable, he said: \u201cGod has kept us alive despite the raging COVID-19 pandemic. We should continue to celebrate and be thankful despite our challenges. It will make us resolve to press forward in the coming year.\n\n\u201cPlease let us be prayerful; all hope is not lost. Yes, the country is going through challenges in the areas of kidnapping, banditry, terrorism and the likes. With God nothing shall be impossible,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nKebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu has felicitated with Christians as they celebrate this year\u2019s Christmas and urged them the period to continue to live in peace with each other irrespective of their religious, political and ethnic differences.\n\nWith Christian faithful marking the birth of Jesus Christ, Kebbi State governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu has called for peaceful coexistence, unity, and patriotism.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mallam Yahyah Sarki, Governor Bagudu said: \u201cWith unity, Nigeria will continue to grow from strength to strength. This means that the country would be at par with its contemporaries. Our diversity and population should be an advantage, more opportunities, and not problems. There is the need for the citizens to also exhibit more love and patriotism in favour of the nation.\u201d\n\nLeading aspirant in the contest for the governorship seat of Cross River State and senator representing Cross River Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Prof Sandy Onor, urged the people of the state to ignore individuals preaching the message of division under the guise of zoning politics. Instead, he advised \u201cthe people to follow the path of love, forgiveness and selflessness as they celebrate this year\u2019s Christmas, saying that love remained the foundation of everything good.\u201d\n\nOnor said there are strong indications that 2022 would be the best in the history of the state, as it would afford members of the various political parties the opportunity to choose the right person to fly their party\u2019s flag for the 2023 election.\n\nHe said: \u201cGod has been very faithful to us as a people during the outgoing year, despite the oddities some of us may have faced. I see a new day ahead of us as Cross Riverians. Events of the past and the failure of the present government in our state to put smiles on your faces may have dampened your spirit. But I implore you to forgive the system and the people at the helm of affairs and show love at all times, especially at this time of Christmas. Next year will be very critical for us a people. It is that year when you will have the opportunity, as member of a political party, to choose who the entire state will support, to take Cross River from the woods.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

We cannot, therefore, afford to sacrifice competence, character, integrity and genuine love for our state on the altar of zoning brouhaha and ethnic jingoism.\u201d\n\nAbia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu while felicitating the people of the state and other Nigerians, urged them to celebrate the season with full understanding of its significance in the life of the average Christian.\n\n\u201cThe birth of Christ is about the most important event in Christianity, since it was the beginning of the redemption of mankind,\u201d the governor said, and assured the people of the state that his administration had taken critical steps to ensure that they were able to take part in the celebrations through the release of about N3.5bn to deal with the issue of salaries of some ailing parastatals and pensioners.\n\nIn her message, immediate past senator who represented Abia Central, Senator Nkechi Nwaogu prayed that the year would end on a cheerful note while thanking God for His kindness, protection, and guidance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has charged Nigerians to remain resilient. The leader of the caucus, Kingsley Chinda, in a statement, yesterday to mark the Christmas said in spite of the economic and security challenges in the country, the citizens must remain hopeful for a better Nigeria.\n\nHis words: \u201cClearly, Christmas comes with bliss, fanfare and happy moments. But what bliss, fanfare and happy moments can we truly say Nigerians are having in the face of glaring hunger, economic hardship, rising cost/standard of living, kidnappings, killings and general insecurity across the country, occasioned by a clueless, inept and incompetent APC led Federal Government? This question clearly leaves us with the reality that as we mark this year\u2019s Christmas, we must remain positive and resilient in the face of these challenges and hope for a better and greater Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAkwa Ibom State governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel has reiterated that the the purpose of the yuletide, saying, \u201cThis is a season where we should banish all ancient animosities and celebrate our oneness and unity, our development and the strides we are collectively making as a state and as a people.\n\n\u201cIt is a season of joy and thankfulness to God for holding us together as a people and as a state, in spite of the economic difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, which unfortunately has now mutated to the Delta and Omicron variants respectively.\u201d\n\nIn his Christmas message, Chairman, Senate Committee on Drugs and Narcotics and senator representing Plateau Central Senatorial District, Sen. Hezekiah Ayuba Dimka Nigerians to emulate Christ and show love, pursue peace and exhibit selfless sacrifice.\n\nChairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Lagos State Chapter, Rt. Rev. Stephen Adegbite, called on Christians to celebrate Christmas by helping the less fortunate and also go for COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAdegbite, yesterday in a statement that read in part, said: \u201cThe message of Christmas is a reminder that love is an essential ingredient and a key tool for peaceful communal coexistence and relationship with one another not minding creed, race, tribe, religious beliefs and other factors that are today promoting hatred, discord, disunity and self centeredness.\n\n\u201cIt is a principle of love your neighbour as yourself. In loving your neighbour, protecting yourself from being a potential spreader of the virus is a responsible thing to do. Do not hesitate or delay in going for the vaccination so that we can reduce and gradually eradicate the spread and keep our world safe.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2018Our courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land. Let us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a special Christmas message personally signed and issued yesterday, promised to ensure that the security challenges facing Nigerians become history soon.\n\nFor years, terrorists have been roaming across the country unhindered, killing, kidnapping and maiming.\n\nWhile rejoicing with Nigerian Christians as they celebrate Christmas, the President declared: \u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\u201d\n\nThe President admitted that despite the \u201cremarkable successes generally recorded,\u201d the nation still has challenges to contend with.\n\nHe noted that the military was doing everything possible to tackle the insecurity menace.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time. It is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\u201d\n\nThe President urged Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in them and see the present order of things as a phase that would also pass, \u201cjust like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe said his government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, adding that the diversification of the economy embarked upon by his government was yielding fruits.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWe shall continue to create opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy. As we felicitate with family, friends, colleagues, associates, let us spare moments to reach out to the less privileged.\n\n\u201cLet us also pray and give words of encouragement to our gallant security personnel fulfilling their oaths to keep us safe.\n\n\u201cI assure my compatriots that this administration remains resolute at ensuring that the standard of living of the average Nigerian is elevated.\u201d\n\nHe assured that his six and half-year administration would fulfill all the promises made to Nigerians before the government terminates in 17 months\u2019 time.\n\nUrges Citizens to Get Vaccinated\n\nAlso in the Christmas message, the President pleaded with all citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that for the second Christmas running, the world would not be able to celebrate as it used to in years past because of the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic, with its attendant debilitating impact, has remained with mankind, mutating and leaving in its wake, devastating consequences on the economy, social interaction, and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining, however, is that humanity has been able to rise up with one voice and purpose, to confront the foisted conditions.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to appeal to our dear citizens to embrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic. Recent events have shown that vaccination greatly reduces the effects of the virus on the human body.\n\n\u201cI will also urge those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC). I commend the efforts of members of the PSC under the headship of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation as they continue to chart a roadmap out of the pandemic and associated issues.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I wish Nigerians Merry Christmas!\u201d\n\nKaigama: Heart of Every Nigerian Heavy with Suffering\n\nThe Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace, Most Revd. Ignatius Kaigama yesterday lamented that the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with the suffering they had experienced and seen in 2021 alone.\n\nKaigama, who stated this in his Christmas message, also called on Nigerians not to give up on the country, saying although the present situations may be tough, \u201cGod is in control.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with security challenges, COVID-19 and agitations for self-determination, Nigerians would not forget 2021 in a hurry.\n\nThe cleric told the faithful not to give up on their country, but \u201cdare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKaigama said: \u201cChristmas this year has found us in the throes of woes and distressing circumstances far beyond our human control. As Nigerians, in almost every part of this country, our hearts are heavy with the suffering we have experienced and seen this year alone \u2013 the many deaths as a result of terrorism, kidnapping and banditry, the depressing economic situation with inflation spiraling out of control, crashing further the ordinary man who has already been drained of joy, peace, and hope.\n\n\u201cThe violent agitations for self-determination, which have come with the loss of lives and limbs, have left horrific scars on our collective psyche. All these make this year one that many Nigerians may not forget in a hurry. Nevertheless, Christmas proclaims, \u2018Joy to the world the Lord has come.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor every disenchanted Nigerian who is on the verge of giving up on this country; for anyone who is prepared to cut off his moorings and drifts away to distant lands, Christmas challenges us to dare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that unbridled corruption and criminality were a grim reminder that selfishness had taken root in the hearts of many statesmen, the Archbishop said: \u201cChristmas is an invitation to give up selfishness, to think only of others and how to bring the greatest happiness to them.\n\n\u201cOn account of Christmas, all our leaders are challenged to once again dream big for our country and to faithfully work hard to realise those dreams so as to find solutions to our teething problems and better the lives of some of the poorest people on earth.\u201d\n\nCatholic Bishops Urge Nigerians to Be Hopeful\n\nCatholic Bishops have urged Nigerians overwhelmed by suffering and hardship not to give up hope of a better Nigeria.\n\nThe bishops said Nigerians should always remember the popular Christmas refrain, Emmanuel which is that \u201cGod is with us\u201d and try to be hopeful of a better future.\n\nIn its Christmas message issued by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) jointly signed by the President, Most Rev. Augustine Akubeze; Vice President, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji and Secretary, Most Rev. Camillus Umoh, the clergymen enjoined Nigerians not to allow any situation to lead them to despair because God is always there to intervene for them.\n\n\u201cThis feast reminds us that God is with us. Therefore, the word \u2018Emmanuel\u2019 should be a constant refrain in our mouths. We should, therefore, not allow any situation to lead us to despair because God is always with us. We are grateful to God for all his divine interventions in our lives. We know that if not for God, things would have been worse.\n\n\u201cI want us to use part of our time during this holy season and maybe even beyond the Christmas Season to develop our capacity to listen to God who speaks to us in silence,\u201d said the bishops.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ganduje demands deployment of more soldiers in Kano\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has described the multiple rocket attacks in Maiduguri by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) ahead of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno State last Thursday as worrisome.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba stated this while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa.\n\nThis is just as the federal government allayed the fears of Nigerians over the reported planned attack by terrorists on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nISWAP had launched multiple rockets on Maiduguri, the state capital, hours before the visit of the President to Borno State.\n\nFive people were killed and many houses destroyed by the ISWAP rockets that landed in different areas, including Ngomari, Bulumkutu, Ajilari, and Ayafe communities.\n\nThe IG, however, said the insurgents were unable to achieve their objectives.\n\n\u201cThey are launching it in major towns, they are launching it in Maiduguri. It is a concern. And it has been seriously checkmated. There are efforts to continuously checkmate it,\u201d Baba said.\n\nHe stressed that although the government and the security forces were particularly concerned about the rocket attacks, the target of the terrorists was defeated by security forces.\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari, during the meeting, tasked all security and intelligence chiefs in attendance to increase the heat against the terrorists and all other criminals, saying none should be spared.\n\nThe IG said they were asked to spare no terrorist or criminal, adding that the target now should be crime prevention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe marching orders are always the same; you have even told Nigerians the marching orders of the President. It has always been the same; there is no space, there is no tolerance to any threat to security.\n\n\u201cThere is no sparing of any terrorist and there must be an intelligence gathering, there must be proactive prevention of crime and there must be checkmating of all those that are involved in criminal activities, whether it is terrorism, banditry or armed robbery or whatever and that is what we are trying to do to the best of our knowledge and ability.\u201d\n\nOn why there are so many policemen deployed to the South-east region of the country, seemingly more than to areas considered more prone to violent crimes, Usman said population, economic activities and other factors determine deployment.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou said it is an allegation which has not been proven, it has always been an allegation. The spaces are different, the whole of the South-east, in terms of landmass, might not be as large as Niger State, so certainly you may see a number of policemen within a very small space, trying to do policing work and you may see another number, not equal, doing much more than that.\n\n\u201cBut when we talk about policing a population or policing a place where there is economic activity or policing in a place where there are more threats, then certainly you have to put more men to govern that small space and that is what you are seeing.\n\nAlso speaking to newsmen, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allayed fears among Nigerians, especially the residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, over reported planned attack on Abuja, saying there is no cause for worry.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any threat to the safety and security of Abuja. Abuja is secure and very safe. If there was a leak, as you mentioned, it could just be an operational alert that does not require any worry or concern. The Council has mandated us to assure Nigerians of their safety, of their security and enduring peace for the period of the festivities.\n\n\u201cThe message of the Security Council, through you to Nigerians, is that all measures for the safety and security of the Nigerian people and Nigeria, are in place for a successful and happy celebration of the yuletide and the New Year. Compliment of the season to all of us from the President and members of the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBefore the commencement of the security meeting, the President swore-in the newly-appointed Minister of State for Works and Housing, Muazu Sambo.\n\nIn attendance at the security meeting yesterday were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.).\n\nOthers include Minister of Defense, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.); Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; Chief of Defense Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo; and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nAlso present were the Inspector-General; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; and the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nGanduje Demands Deployment of more Soldiers\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more military personnel to forests in the state.\n\nSpeaking to journalists yesterday after meeting with the president in Abuja, Ganduje said he came to brief Buhari on the security situation in his state.\n\nHe called for the establishment of another military training base in the forest bordering Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi and Plateau, as part of efforts to check the activities of criminals.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThere are challenges all over the country that are unfortunate, but we believe Mr. President is doing his best with other stakeholders in order to curtail the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need the helping hand of almost everybody, especially governors and chairmen of local governments. We have observed that the security situation is worsening now. Our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, terrorists, armed robbers and criminals.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, we have taken some measures. We have two large forests, including the Falgore forest, which borders Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the army and there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest, using the facilities that we have provided.\n\n\u201cSo, that is helping to checkmate the activities of bandits in that forest and I have requested Mr. President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\u201d\n\nHe added that the state introduced the use of technology within its forests to improve effective communication between security operatives in the state.\n\nAccording to Ganduje, the state has also constituted an enlarged security committee to promote efforts to maintain peace.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have introduced technology within the forest. From the office of the DSS in Kano and the office of the commissioner of police and even from my office, we are able to monitor what is happening in that forest.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s effective communication between the DSS and the police and those who are managing the forest \u2014 the checkpoints and various places that security agencies are manning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re laying over 100 kilometres of optic fibre within the Kano metropolis, so that CCTV cameras will be more effective and we can manage the whole mega city in terms of security and also in terms of network improvement.\n\n\u201cWe have also constituted what we call an enlarged security committee because limiting it to the air force, army, police, DSS, civil defence, I think the security network, in terms of flow of information, requires much more than that.\n\n\u201cAlso, we introduced technology. As earlier mentioned, we have the most powerful tracker in the country. Through that one, even some people who escaped to Niger Republic, Cameroon, we were able to trace them and connect with international security agencies for their arrest.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Says with new hardware, military more prepared to flush out terrorists\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said his administration would support families of dead and wounded soldiers, and help them realise their potential. Buhari stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when he addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base.\n\nIn a related development, the president stated that with the acquisition of more capability in military technology and hardware, the country was better prepared to deal with terrorists, especially in the North-east. Buhari gave the assurance on yesterday in Maiduguri after inaugurating some projects donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi.\n\nBuhari, who addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base, said the military had almost eliminated completely insurgency and other security issues threatening the country. He urged men of Operation Hadin Kai, the military operation against insurgency in the North-east, to remain steadfast as they went into the final phase of the campaign against terrorism and other criminalities.\n\nHe urged them to stay focused \u201cto achieve our strategic end-state, which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North-east geo-political zone and other parts of the country, where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment.\u201d\n\nThe president told the soldiers that the whole country remained grateful to them for their gallantry in ensuring the gradual return of peace to the North-east. He condoled with families that had lost loved ones, as well as the wounded.\n\nBuhari assured the families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the country, and the injured that the federal government would cater for their needs, in recognition of their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nHe asserted before the troops, \u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country. Your career is like no other, because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others. I am, therefore, here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu, and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021. I do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and, indeed, the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the troops for their extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces are known for. Well done. Our country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterised by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people, who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes. Further to the reorganisations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the threat posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the president said substantial resources had been directed to procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal. He said similar attention was being given to intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari told the troops that at the onset of his administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force. This was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimise the mutual gains for our respective national security,\u201d Buhari told the troops.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North-east region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region. I am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy.\u201d\n\nHe assured the people that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders, including friendly nations and civil society organisations, to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nWhile appreciating the government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the federal government in multiple spheres, the president added, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the federal government and states.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence staff, service chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation, which continues to enhance operations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the research and development exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s annual conference and the launch of locally constructed seaward defence ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander-in-Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices, which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible.\u201d\n\nBuhari also said the manpower challenges, which had limited the rotation of some units from the theatre, would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.\n\nIn a related development, Buhari assured that hard times awaited terrorists troubling the North-west, with the procurement of high-tech equipment and hardware by the military.\n\nHe also said he would continue to do his best for the development of the country until May 2023, when he would statutorily leave the presidency.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday in Maiduguri after the inauguration of Oriental Energies Resource Ltd Hanger, Muhammadu Indimi Distance Learning Centre, and an International Conference Centre donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi, he expressed concern at the level of insecurity in the North West zone.\n\nHe said it was sad that the people of the North-west, who prior to now lived together, sharing same culture and outlook for a long time, would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nBuhari said, \u201c I know I swore by the constitution, and I will leave in 17 months. I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country, and we thank God for giving us so much resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state of the art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri. I am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North-east but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar, which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state for the work he had done in two years, and said he was in the state in June to commission development projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum appreciated the president for honouring the state, adding that Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c the governor said.\n\nZulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him, now Alhajji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nSpeaking also, Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s lastest loan to fund startups is a product of VP Osibajo Silicon Valley visit",
          "text": "Three years ago, during a roadshow that lasted three days, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osibajo visited San Francisco\u2019s Silicon Valley to meet with the executives of top tech companies, in order to attract investments to Nigeria\u2019s thriving tech space. The VP, with newly inaugurated members of his Advisory Group on Technology and Creativity, met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue before ending the trip at the entertainment centre of the world, Hollywood, where he met with representatives from Sony, Disney, 20th Century, and Imax.\n\nDuring talks in the roadshow, some investors hinted that even though they are willing to invest in Nigeria, they want the government to have some skin in the tech ecosystem game. When they got back from the trip, the office of the Vice President contacted the African Development Bank (AfDB) to support Nigeria with funding.\n\nThe dividends of these efforts did not materialise until this year when the AfDB approved a loan of $170 million to finance the Digital and Creative Enterprises Programme (i-DICE), an initiative by the federal government of Nigeria to promote digital and creative industries in the country. The programme is co-financed by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB)\n\n\u201cGovernments have a much greater role than just policy making. They need to be innovative and create an enabling environment that includes infrastructure and de-risking to harness private sector investments in key growth sectors,\u201d said African Development Bank President Akinwumi A. Adesina, speaking on AfDB\u2019s investment.\n\nThe i-DICE programme is a first-of-its-kind programme that intends to boost innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, enhance social development, boost innovation, and achieve economic transformation by fostering growth in the technology and creative ecosystem. From 2022 to 2026, the programme seeks to attract approximately US$695.80 million to finance various programmatic interventions (US$227.80m) and ground-breaking investment in businesses in the technology and creative sector (US$468m).\n\nThis investment will stimulate 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial benefits to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises. The programme is also expected to help reduce the country\u2019s growing unemployment rate by creating 6.1 million direct and indirect jobs. AfDB\u2019s recent investment alone will support the creation of about 850,000 jobs. It is estimated that the entire added value of the programme to the Nigerian economy would be $6.4 billion.\n\nThe programme will support the digital and creative space across four pillars: human capital, enabling environment, finance, and infrastructure. i-DICE will engage in skill development to equip Nigerians from ages 15 to 34 with technology and creative skills to increase their employability, foster innovation in both ecosystems, and widen the pool of entrepreneurs in the country. One of the ways it aims to do this is by upgrading the physical infrastructure of selected tertiary institutions\u2014universities and polytechnics\u2014to satellite labs and innovation centres of excellence and digital entrepreneurship (ICEDE); and online infrastructure\u2014by upgrading the selected online platform to host digital training content and other modules/features.\n\nIt will also support technology and creative enterprises by organising Hackathons, providing mentorship, launching a startup voucher programme that will support early-stage startups and entrepreneurs with access to workspace and hubs. It will also help these organisations cut cost by providing them with infrastructure like off-grid power solutions.\n\nThrough the Nigeria Entrepreneurship and Innovation Investment Fund, with an initial closing of $468 million, the programme will provide funding for early- and growth-stage businesses in the technology and creative industries in Nigeria. The Fund will invest in these businesses through three funding routes. It will do this by direct investments or debt financing of up to 85% in the Series A rounds of growth-stage startups and about 15-30% in the funding rounds of early-stage startups. Other ways it will also invest in these businesses is by subscribing to closed-end private funds as a Limited Partner of micro-venture capital firms and well-established venture capital firms and investing in listed private equity companies, funds, or other vehicles.\n\nNeed for a government-led fund for startups\n\nThe federal government discovered that while it has gotten relatively easier for Nigerian founders to raise money after series A, those in the early stage trying to raise some money to build an MVP or wanting to test their product and market find it much more difficult to raise money. So, the federal government is coming into the space to support investments in these early-stage startups.\n\nIn the process that led to the creation of this programme, a report Catalysing Growth through Innovation, funded by the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), was published by the federal government to map out the innovation going on in the country.\n\nIfe Adebayo, Special Assistant to the Vice President on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, one of the brains behind the programme, explained that the government is involved in funding startups because it will help the ecosystem engage more confidently with investors, since the government is also actively involved in the ecosystem.\n\nThis is against the backdrop of the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSB), a bill that promises to create an enabling environment for Nigerian startups to thrive by resolving standing issues like the unfavourable regulatory environment, weak infrastructure, and lack of innovation incentives like tax breaks. The bill moved closer to being enacted into law when it was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) just last week. This programme hopes to ensure the localisation of the bill when it is passed into law, across all the states of the country. It will serve as a framework to test how effective the bill will be in the ecosystem.\n\nAnother important reason for the government\u2019s foray into the tech ecosystem is to invest outside the Lagos and Abuja bubble. The programme will be targeting states like Enugu and Kaduna where innovation activities are increasing, and some other parts of the country where it is at beginner level.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Venture funding in Senegal remains muted despite Wave\u2019s $200m buzz",
          "text": "Much of the global hype about and investment in startups operating in Africa over the past decade have been skewed towards English-speaking countries. The reality is reflected in annual reports on startup funding in the continent and 2021 has been no different.\n\nThis year, Africa has minted five unicorns, a term used to describe startups that have a market value equal to or over $1 billion. Flutterwave, Andela, OPay, Chipper Cash, and Wave joined Jumia, Interswitch, and Fawry in the exclusive club, bringing Africa\u2019s total unicorn count to eight.\n\nOf those that achieved the billion-dollar valuation in 2021, only Wave was built in a French-speaking country. In September, the Senegal-based mobile money provider raised $200 million from mostly American investors, in what was the biggest ever Series A round in Africa.\n\nAt the time, Wave\u2019s continental record raise was considered by some as a sign that Senegal\u2019s startup funding fortunes were beginning to change. However, the startup\u2019s success has so far proven to be the exception and not the rule, in the last three months of 2021.\n\nThe country reportedly has around 70 startups and, according to fundraising data compiled by Max Cuvellier and Maxime Bayen\u2019s The Big Deal, the ecosystem has raised only $22 million in 17 deals apart from Wave\u2019s Series A this year. Just one other Senegalese startup, Yobante Express, raised over $1 million.\n\nSenegal\u2019s low levels of startup investing activity, compared to countries like Nigeria or South Africa, is a stark representation of a long-standing funding gap that exists between the anglophone and francophone West Africa regions.\n\nGenerally, economies in the latter are much less developed than those in English-speaking regions when it comes to tech. While Nigeria has abundant incubators and accelerators, the scale obtainable in Senegal, Cameroon, or C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2014home to French-speaking West Africa\u2019s most promising tech ecosystems\u2014is much smaller.\n\nHence venture capital investors have historically drifted towards the region\u2019s more developed tech hubs. This year, African startups have raised more than $4 billion in funding, so far. Nigeria alone accounts for 35% of this funding and, along with Ghana, took the lion\u2019s share, some 86%, of funding that flowed into West African startups. French-speaking Senegal (13%), Cameroon (0.7%), and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (0.3%) make up the rest of the startup funding share, according to available data.\n\nThe significantly strict regulatory landscape in francophone Africa is often cited as a major factor that\u2019s contributed to a venture funding apathy held by foreign investors, who prefer to invest in anglophone markets.\n\n\u201cFrancophone Africa inherited the French system\u2019s bureaucracy, heavy administration, and governance style; as such, processes and regulations can be stricter than in other regions,\u201d Coura Sene, Wave\u2019s General Manager for the eight French-speaking countries in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), told TechCabal in this interview.\n\nShe adds that with English being the \u201cde facto language in technology and the digital era, it\u2019s more natural for investors to focus on Anglophone markets\u201d such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOwing to the conservative nature of regulators in the region, Wave itself opted to partner with local commercial banks to launch its mobile money service rather than obtain an independent license from the get-go, just to make authorities \u201cmore comfortable\u201d with its solution. As the startup expands into other countries like C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Togo, and Benin Republic, however, it intends to get an independent mobile money license.\n\nTo Ashley Gauzere, founder of HUB2, a C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire-based startup that provides digital infrastructure solutions for banking and insurance providers, another problem is the penetration of technology-enabled products in Africa\u2019s French-speaking countries, which is significantly low compared to their anglophone counterparts.\n\nHUB2\u2019s services are available in nine (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Guinea, Togo, Benin, and Gabon) of 14 countries in the CIMA zone, a central supervisory authority established in 1992, overseeing insurance in French-speaking, sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nDespite the drawbacks and yet another subdued startup funding performance this year (apart from Wave\u2019s raise), Cynthia Mandjek, investment manager at France-based, Africa-focused VC firm Saviu Ventures, thinks investors are waking up to opportunities in francophone Africa, which is \u201clong overdue\u201d for disruption.\n\nSene shares this sentiment and is bullish on the region\u2019s potentials, pointing to its homogeneity in currency (the CFA franc) and language as an attraction. \u201cIf you take the region as a whole, which shares the same currency and language, you start to appreciate the total size of the market. The opportunities it presents outweigh any perceived challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the differences in each country, once your product gains ground in more than one country, I believe this becomes a significant competitive advantage,\u201d Moulaye Tabour\u00e9, founder of Ivorian fashion retail startup Afrikrea noted in an interview with Rest of World. \u201cNetwork effects started in the zone are more resilient and cheaper to sustain than from Nigeria to Kenya, for example.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the notably growing startup ecosystem in Senegal\u2014Wave\u2019s home country where Sene says there\u2019s \u201cmore appetite\u201d for digitisation\u2014is well-positioned to play an anchor role in attracting investor attention, and potential investments, into the francophone region.\n\n\u201cIt might not be the largest by gross domestic product compared to the much larger Ivorian economy, but there\u2019s definitely more appetite for digital products,\u201d the Wave GM said.\n\nIn addition to the appetite, Senegal is home to a large number of startups (though most are still in their infancy), co-working spaces, incubators, and accelerators, as well as local investment funds such as Partech and Orange Digital Ventures. However, instead of equity, the majority of funding available in the market are grants and concessional loans.\n\nThat should change as the country\u2019s tech sector grows and attracts more non-francophone Africa investors, according to stakeholders, who believe it might be too soon to start gauging the impact of Wave\u2019s funding success on the broader regional tech ecosystem.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Flutterwave x Wizkid to drive global payments adoption",
          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

However, the election of Alhaji Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola with his pragmatic, all inclusive, bottom-up approach and starling administrative style of his administration has brought solace and comfort to our senatorial district and the state in general\n\n\u201cThe Development in many facets and spheres including and not limited to Education, Health, security, Massive Infrastructural Development, welfarism, party rejuvenation, prompt and timely payment of full salaries and approval of minimum wage across board remain convincing proofs while His Excellency Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola should be given our unwavering Support for his re-election come July 16th 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are amazed that despite the myriads of economic challenges and inherited huge debt burden , the Oyetola\u2019s Administration has continued regular issuance of pensionable bond Certificates, payment of monthly Pension to Pensioners on the old Pension scheme and constant Release of funds for the settlement of gratitutes to the tun of N40 billion within the last three years.\n\n\u201cOur senatorial districts has benefited greatly from Oyetola\u2019s Administration massive Infrastructural Programmes in the following Sectors such as roads, education, health and social services, water provision, flood control, dredging of rivers and streams across the entire senatorial district, fumigation of market stalls/Schools and public places across the entire senatorial district.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, we leaders of APC Osun West Senatorial District are declaring our hearty resolution to remain committed, loyal , supportive and dependable allies of His Excellency Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola in working selflessly for the realisation of his second term come 16th day of July 2022.\n\n\u201cBased of this stand, we are also Declaring to the world that no APC Member from Osun west Senatorial District will contest party primaries against incumbent performing Governor and whoever does that is not known to us and does not/would not have our Support in any form whatsoever but we are saying \u201cOyetola Leekan Si\u201d as we continue to strategize as a senatorial district to take over from Alhaji Adegboyega Oyetola come 2026.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Nobel Peace prize laureate and South Africa\u2019s anti apartheid hero, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has died aged 90.\n\nTutu\u2019s death comes just weeks after that of South Africa\u2019s last apartheid-era president, FW de Clerk, who died at the age of 85.\n\nReacting to his death, President Cyril Ramaphosa said it marked \u201canother chapter of bereavement in our nation\u2019s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa said Tutu was \u201can iconic spiritual leader, anti-apartheid activist and global human rights campaigner\u201d.\n\nHe described him as \u201ca patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead.\n\n\u201cA man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Tutu had helped bequeath \u201ca liberated South Africa,\u201d he added.\n\nTutu was one of the country\u2019s best known figures at home and abroad; a contemporary of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, he was was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991.\n\nHe was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation was among those paying tributes, saying Tutu\u2019s \u201ccontributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies.\n\n\u201cHe was an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.\u201d\n\nIt is impossible to imagine South Africa\u2019s long and tortuous journey to freedom \u2013 and beyond \u2013 without Archbishop Desmond Tutu. While other struggle leaders were killed, or forced into exile, or prison, the diminutive, defiant Anglican priest was there at every stage, exposing the hypocrisy of the apartheid state, comforting its victims, holding the liberation movement to account, and daring Western governments to do more to isolate a white-minority government that he compared, unequivocally, to the Nazis, BBC reported.\n\nWhen democracy arrived, Tutu used his moral authority to oversee the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that sought to expose the crimes of the white-minority government. Later he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa\u2019s former liberation movement, the ANC.\n\nMany South Africans today will remember Tutu\u2019s personal courage, and the clarity of his moral fury. But as those who knew him best have so often reminded us, Tutu was always, emphatically, the voice of hope. And it is that hope, that optimism, accompanied, so often, by his trademark giggles and cackles, that seems likely to shape the way the world remembers, and celebrates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nKnown affectionately as The Arch, Tutu was instantly recognisable, with his purple clerical robes, cheery demeanour and almost constant smile.\n\nHe was not afraid to show his emotions in public, including memorably laughing and dancing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in South Africa in 2010.\n\nDespite his popularity though he was not a man who was loved by all. He was very critical of the African National Congress (ANC) government in the post-apartheid era, when, at times, he felt it was misrepresenting South Africa \u2013 even warning in 2011 that he would pray for its downfall over a cancelled visit by the Dalai Lama.\n\nIn response, the national police commissioner Gen Bheki Cele told Tutu to \u201cgo home and shut up\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe is not a vice-Jesus Christ,\u201d he said.\n\nOrdained as a priest in 1960, Tutu went on to serve as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto. He became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year. He used his high-profile role to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political.\n\nAfter Mandela became South Africa\u2019s first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era.\n\nHe was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.",

His number was switched off. I have called the Commissioner of Police. He said the order came from above.\n\n\u201cUche Nwosu, my wife and daughter were at the church for an outing service when a group of men in police uniform, while sermon was on going, started shooting.\n\n\u201cIn the course of their activities, they pushed down my wife and they tore my daughter clothes.

Lawmakers who attended the burial were suspended.\n\n\u201cI am waiting to hear the offence of Uche Nwosu. Recall that Hope Uzodimma said he is going to name sponsors of insecurity in Imo State on January 3.\n\n\u201cI Know he has nothing to offer than to cook up a story. Last time he ordered my arrest and one security office ordered me to enter the pickup vehicle.\n\n\u201cUzodimma wants to frame me up by all means. Uzodinma has to answer for most of the activities going on,\u201d Okorocha stated.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari gave the service chiefs a new marching order yesterday to smash the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), which has surpassed Boko Haram in the North East conflict, before he leaves office in 2023.\n\nBuhari gave the order during a Security Council meeting in Abuja 24 hours after the gang launched rockets near the Maiduguri airport just as the President landed in the city.\n\nSeveral people were killed by the rockets.\n\n\ufffcPolice Inspector General Alkali Baba Usman said some of the masterminds of the attack have been eliminated.\n\nAnd in his Christmas message yesterday, the President told Nigerians to invoke the \u201cindomitable spirit in us and see the present order of things as a phase that will also pass, just like other unsavoury situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\ufffcThe Nation gathered that Buhari, during the Security Council meeting, directed that no inch of Nigerian territory should be ceded to terrorists.\n\nBuhari wondered why ISWAP insurgents kept striking from the same corridor unchecked and told the Service Chiefs to be prepared to win the war against insurgency before he leaves office.\n\n\ufffcThe President\u2019s second term expires in May 2023.\n\nBuhari said he meant what he told the troops in Maiduguri on the need to rout Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgents.\n\n\ufffcA top source, who spoke in confidence with one of our correspondents, said the meeting was a \u201cfrank appraisal session.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one was happy with how the ISWAP insurgents struck on Thursday and took the shine off Mr. President\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cThe President could not understand the recurring assaults from the same corridor or axis,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cWe had a similar incident on December 4. And before the President\u2019s visit, a security /intelligence evaluation was done with a caveat that there should be a subsidiary operation to cordon off this axis.\n\n\u201cYet the insurgents fired rockets from the same axis and targeted the Maiduguri International Airport.\n\n\u201cAlthough the President did not betray emotions during his visit, he was certainly not happy with the situation of things.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question, the source said: \u201cThe President asked the Service Chiefs not to give terrorists, especially the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), a breathing space. He directed that no inch of Nigerian territory must be occupied by terrorists.\n\n\u201cHe warned against the reversal of the gains the military has made. He also sought a more proactive campaign to rout the insurgents, whether Boko Haram or ISWAP.\n\n\u201cHe said his administration is prepared to win the war against insurgency.\u201d\n\nThe Nation also gathered that top Army Generals were yesterday deployed in Borno State to \u201creview the situation and boost the war against the insurgents.\n\nAnother source added: \u201cMany Army Generals arrived in Borno State on Friday to review the situation and improve on the operational strategies.\u201d\n\nBuhari at Christmas: How we can end this unsavoury security situation.\n\nThe President in his Christmas message as Nigeria joins the rest of the world today to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ asked Nigerians to invoke the \u201cindomitable spirit in us and see the present order of things as a phase that will also pass, just like other unsavoury situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nSimilar goodwill messages came from Senate President Ahmed Lawan, House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, state governors, the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and the Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, Dr.Ignatius Kaigama, who said the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with suffering arising from the situation in the country.\n\nBuhari said Nigeria is yet to overcome its security challenges \u201cdespite the remarkable successes generally recorded.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time.\n\n\u201cIt is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\n\n\u201cI urge Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in us and see the present order of things as a phase that will also pass, just like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, while it would continue to \u201ccreate opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said this is the second Christmas running that the world \u201cwill not be able to celebrate as we used to in years past,\u201d on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to \u201cembrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic.\u201d\n\nHe asked those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC).\n\nAPC: We\u2019re solidly committed to innovations to improve Nigeria\u2019s electioneering processes\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) said it remains solidly committed to \u201cconstitutionally permitted and practical innovations and processes that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria\u2019s election eering processes and internal democracy.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Dr. John Akpanudoedehe, assured Nigerians of the Buhari administration\u2019s \u201ccapacity, intent and urgency to check and contain all criminalities so that Nigerians could go about their legitimate activities across the country safely.\u201d\n\nThe party urged Nigerians to \u201cuse the joyful season to give and show love to our fellow men, particularly the needy and vulnerable among us,\u201d while also urging \u201cprayers and support for our selfless security and other essential services massively deployed around the country to ensure safe travel and yuletide festivities.\u201d\n\nPDP to Nigerians: Let\u2019s reinforce our determination for national rebirth\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) advised Nigerians to use the Christmas to reinforce their determination for national rebirth.\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, also stressed the need for Nigerians to unite and show love to one another, in line with the party\u2019s mission to \u201crescue and rebuild the nation from misrule\u201d.\n\nThe party said it was \u201cdeeply worried that in the last six years, Nigerians have been forced to mark Christmas in gloom, pain, anguish and utter despondency following excruciating economic hardship and worsened insecurity.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cThe PDP is saddened that while people celebrate in other parts of the world, many Nigerian families could not afford the basic items of celebration or even travel, as they did in the past, to meet and bond with their loved ones due to high costs, worsened insecurity and deplorable state of roads which are now death traps in our country.\n\nThe PDP however urged Nigerians not to allow the suffering they face today to dampen or destroy their inner personalities as happy people so as not to lose sight of the message of hope, salvation and brighter future which Christmas offers.\n\nNational Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, charged Nigerians to keep hope alive in spite of daunting circumstances.\n\nAyu, in a Christmas goodwill message, said although the occasion symbolises love, hope, sharing, celebration and thanksgiving, the gloomy economic situation has made such very difficult.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut I charge Nigerians not to lose hope. Keep hope alive. There is life beyond the APC gloom. The day will break after this long night. Do not let the sorry state of the nation dampen the Christmas spirit\u201d.\n\nAtiku Abubakar urges Nigerians to sow seeds of unity.",

Nigeria wants good leaders. This will be someone who is ready to sacrifice so many things for the country. There will be a lot that will surround who will become the next president of Nigeria. The person will not be too old or too young. The person will have a clean bill of health from scandals. Of course, the Igbo will find it difficult and tough. They will come up with propaganda in order to keep them in the race.\n\n\u201cIn the 2023 election, Nigeria will want to pick the best candidate. The Northern states will be divided; some will support the South while some people will support the North. Governors from the Southern states will not speak with one voice. The Governors will be divided on personal grounds.\n\n\u201cAPC and PDP will do everything possible to reach consensus so that it won\u2019t cause problems. The pattern of the Southerners will be very firm while that of the Easterners will be very weak. They will make moves but they won\u2019t achieve their expected desires. Of course, the two leading parties will make bold moves that will make the 3rd party re-strategizes their plans.\n\n\u2018\u2019I foresee that whoever wins the 2023 election will be given the mandate freely given by the electorate. The spirit of God says Buhari is ready to handover and will not interfere or dabble into the affairs of who becomes the next President.

          "title": "Abuja artisans cry out: AEPB officials extorting, forcing us into crime",
          "text": "Artisans and roadside workers earning their daily incomes in and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have cried out to authorities of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), especially the management of Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) over alleged and incessant extortion by some personnel of the board raiding their business premises.\n\nThe artisans claimed the AEPB officials often extorted money from them for allegedly flouting FCT sanitation laws.\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint, the artisans called government\u2019s attention to activities of the AEPB officials who moved around in their numbers daily in a patrol van.\n\nThe artisans said they (AEPB) would order them to part with some money for using their business premises, failure of which their tools would be impounded and taken to the Area 3 Garki office of the agency where they would be made to pay fines without receipts before release.\n\nSpeaking to one of Blueprint reporters in tears, a roadside vulcanizer at Wuye, Kazeem Oyinlola, said his experience with AEPB has not been palatable.\n\n\u201cI have always been their victim anytime they come here. There was a time they came to Wuye here and carried my machine in my absence. That day, after I resumed work, I had to rush back to Karmo hospital because my wife was on admission there. When I was told that AEPB people came and carried my machine, I quickly returned and went to their office at Area 3. There, they told me to pay N10, 000 or face a mobile court. After much plea, it was reduced to N5, 000. That day, I had nothing on me because I hadn\u2019t worked before I rushed to Karmo. It was our union chairman that assisted me with the amount before my machine was released. To my surprise, there was no receipt. When I asked, they warned me never to ask them for any receipt.\n\n\u201cAs if that was not enough, they have been coming here almost thrice in a week. Anytime they come in their truck, they would beckon on us and demand that we give them some money. If anyone says no, they would come down from their truck and confiscate the tools; so any time they come, even if we don\u2019t have money, we would run round to borrow and give them before they would go. They don\u2019t even care whether we have worked that day or not.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am tired of AEPB. I don\u2019t want to steal; this is the only thing I can do to feed myself, wife and a daughter. They are driving me into crime if this continues. So far, I can say that since this year, I have spent almost N50, 000 to these people. Where do they want us to go? Are we not part of the society again?\u201d he asked in anger.\n\nCorroborating Oyinlola\u2019s position is Mr Victor Nwabanike, who specialises in tyre alignment within the same premises.\n\nHe said: \u201cAEPB has taken my tools away many times especially as the Christmas approaches. Whenever that happens, we would follow their vehicle to somewhere nearby where they would ask us to pay some money after which they would release the tools without any receipt. Even yesterday, they came around and parked my tools again. I quickly mobilised some money for them before they left. That is the challenge we face here. I don\u2019t litter the environment here and I am not close to the road, so I don\u2019t know why they chose to be doing this to us here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nwabanike, \u201cinstead of this money we pay these people without receipt, government should create a layout clearly marked out for rent by artisans whereby the government can generate income instead of this regular extortion without any receipt.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the development, Chairman of Artisans and Roadside Auto Mechanic in Wuye, Mr Adeniyi Owolabi, said the association comprises mechanics, vulcanizers, car wash operators, food vendors, and herbal medicine sellers (agbo).\n\nHe said though mechanics have never been extorted by AEPB personnel, others like vulcanizers, car wash operators, food and herbal medicine sellers have complained about alleged extortion by AEPB.\n\n\u201cThey do come to our area here to carry vulcanizers\u2019 tools and car wash as well as those who do car alignment. They will pack their tools to their office because they couldn\u2019t offer the taskforce anything. Most times, I bail them out myself without any receipt. Here, we are not criminals; we come here to work and help ourselves. In fact, our presence here has prevented criminals from entering the estate. Before now, from this place to the foot of the hill, it was complete bush. However, our presence has prevented criminals from entering the estate.\n\n\u201cLet AEPB stop harassing our members so that they can do legitimate work to help themselves and those they render services to.\u201d\n\nSimilar views were expressed by some artisans in Jahi, Kado Estate, Gwarimpa, Kubwa and a couple of other areas.\n\n\u201cIt is terrible that we could be treated this way by the AEPB people as Nigerians. Are they saying we are not entitled to living in and around Abuja? They should not drive us into crimes. Survival has been very tough for every Nigerian, artisan inclusive. We are using our hands to earn legitimate livelihood, yet we are being persecuted. Let government look into it and save our lives and by extension the nation from further security woes. Nigeria can\u2019t afford another security challenge,\u201d said Sunday Yusuf, an artisan in Kubwa.\n\nSecurity implication\n\nSpeaking on the security implication of this raid on the artisans, a retired police officer and CEO of Crime Guard, Mr Teidi Ameh, said it portends a dangerous signal for the already-tensed security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cLet official policies allow sleeping dogs to lie. Apart from the services those categories of people offer, when a large pool of such people that are already used to handling hard metals are exposed to crimes, residents of cities and estates would find it difficult to stay peacefully. I have personally noticed the misbehaviour of some of those boys in AEPB trucks; unfortunately, some of them also exhibit criminal tendencies such that one wonders how they got that job. But their activities should be moderated so that it doesn\u2019t exacerbate the current security situation.\u201d\n\nAllegations false \u2013 AEPB\n\nBut the management of AEPB has denied the alleged extortion by its personnel, describing it as baseless, mere insinuations and fake news targeted at ruining AEPB\u2019s reputation.\n\n\n\nAEPB Deputy Director Information and Public Relations Mrs Janet Peni made the agency\u2019s position known in an interview with Blueprint. She said officials of the board were concerned with maintaining sanity in the city and would not compromise, noting that linking AEPB to AMAC officials was wrong.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe present AEPB under the watch of Kaka Ali has taken additional steps to consolidate on the successes it had recorded and would not limit the standards.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbuja Environmental Protection Board is different from Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and their activities don\u2019t concern us, we must not forget that AMAC is a local government situated in the Federal Capital City.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are keen on our roles in ensuring sanity in the Federal Capital Territory and we would be happy if those claiming that our men harass come to our office with evidence.\n\n\n\n\u201cAEPB doesn\u2019t compromise; anyone found guilty would face the full wrath of the administration.\u201d",

There was no looting whatsoever as being speculated by some people in the Social Media.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw on social media was staff of Next Cash n Carry trying to salvage the goods using trolleys. Nothing was taken out of the premises,\u201d she further quoted Idriss as saying.\n\nIdriss also said investigations were ongoing to ascertain the immediate cause of the fire.\n\nHe further said no life was lost to the incident neither was anyone within the premises injured.\n\nThe FERMA boss appealed to business owners in the territory to factor in the risk element in their business plans, noting that fire trucks were hampered by limited access within the shopping mall.\n\nLooting spree\n\nNotwithstanding FERMA\u2019s position that there was no looting, Blueprint gathered via a 30-second video clip seen by our reporter that it was a looting spree for some people.\n\nThe video showed looters running in and out of the burning supermarket.\n\nItems such as bottled water, packets of minerals, mattresses, plasma tv, and computer sets were being carried away by the looters.\n\nIn the same video, a female looter was seen telling others coming out of the supermarket with items they were carting away from the supermarket, \u201cuna well done o,\u201d as she made her way into the supermarket.\n\nAlso, one of the looters could be heard telling another one in Igbo language; \u201chold the item in your hand very well ooh.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Blueprint saw some under aged as well as adults who were obviously not the company workers, struggling to cart away some items while efforts were on to put out the fire.",

          "text": "South African anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, described as the country\u2019s moral compass, died on Sunday aged 90, sparking an outpouring of tributes for the outspoken Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nThe small-statured Tutu, who had largely faded from public life in recent years, was remembered for his easy humour and characteristic smile \u2014 and above all his tireless fight against injustices of all colours.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa honoured this fight in a tribute to Tutu, announcing the archbishop\u2019s death on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation\u2019s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDesmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world.\u201d\n\nMourners gathered outside his former parish in Cape Town, St George\u2019s Cathedral, while others massed at his home, some holding flower bouquets, according to an AFP journalist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very very sad he died. He was such a good man,\u201d said retired accountant Diane Heard.\n\nThe South African cricket team wore black armbands in his honour of the first day of the first Test against India in South Africa.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said, \u201cTutu inspired a generation of African leaders who embraced his non-violent approaches in the liberation struggle\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: South African Court Says Zuma Can Appeal Return To Jail\n\n\u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019\n\nA tireless activist, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for combatting white minority rule in his country.\n\nFamously outspoken, even after the fall of the racist apartheid regime, Tutu never shied away from confronting South Africa\u2019s shortcomings or injustices.\n\nIt was Tutu who coined and popularised the term \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d to describe South Africa when Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Tutu slammed even the ruling African National Congress (ANC) \u2014 the vanguard of the fight against white-minority rule \u2014 for cronyism and nepotism after apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nIn the past, he has confronted homophobia in the Anglican Church, challenged Mandela over-generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticised the corruption that mushroomed under ex-president Jacob Zuma.\n\nOrdained at the age of 30 and appointed archbishop in 1986, he used his position to advocate for international sanctions against apartheid, and later to lobby for rights globally.\n\nTutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent repeated treatment.\n\nHis public appearances become increasingly scarce, and in one of his last this year, he emerged from hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid vaccine, waving but not offering comment.\n\nHe retired in 1996 to lead a harrowing journey into South Africa\u2019s brutal past, as head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nFor 30 months, the commission lifted the lid on the horrors of apartheid.\n\n\u2018Larger than Life\u2019\n\nTutu, with his instinctive humanity, broke down and sobbed at one of its first hearings.\n\n\u201cHe articulated the universal outrage at the ravages of apartheid and touchingly and profoundly demonstrated the depth of meaning of ubuntu, reconciliation and forgiveness,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu \u201can extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was larger than life, and for so many in South Africa and around the world his life has been a blessing,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nTutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on October 7, 1931, to a domestic worker and a school teacher.\n\nHe trained as a teacher before anger at the inferior education system set up for black children prompted him to become a priest.\n\nHe lived for a while in Britain, where, he recalled, he would needlessly ask for directions just to be called \u201cSir\u201d by a white policeman.\n\nTutu relentlessly challenged the status quo on issues like race, homosexuality and religious doctrine and gave his pioneering support for the assisted dying movement.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t shy away from his own end.\n\n\u201cI have prepared for my death and have made it clear that I do not wish to be kept alive at all costs,\u201d he said in an opinion piece in The Washington Post in 2016.\n\n\u201cI hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life\u2019s journey in the manner of my choice.\u201d\n\nTutu\u2019s death came just weeks after F.W de Klerk, South Africa\u2019s last apartheid-era president passed away on November 11.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "A Reuters witness said security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds on a tenth day of major demonstrations since an Oct. 25 coup. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said 178 people were injured during Saturday\u2019s protest, with eight caused by live bullets. Protesters opposed to military rule reached near the presidential palace in the Sudanese capital on Saturday for the second time in a week, television images showed, despite heavy tear gas and a communications blackout. In separate statements, the committee said security forces entered Khartoum Hospital and Port Sudan Hospital.\n\nA week ago, demonstrators begin a sit-in at the gates of the palace before being dispersed. But on Saturday they were met with by security forces and turned back. Internet services were disrupted in the capital, and residents were unable to make or receive phone calls, the witnesses said, while soldiers and Rapid Support Forces blocked roads leading to bridges linking Khartoum with Omdurman, its sister city across the Nile. Protests against the coup have continued even after Abdallah Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister last month. The demonstrators have demanded that the military play no role in government during a transition to free elections. Service began to return for at least some users late on Saturday.\n\nSome people managed to post images on social media showing protests in several other cities, including Madani and Atbara. In Omdurman, security forces fired tear gas at protesters near a bridge connecting the city to central Khartoum, another Reuters witness said.\n\n\u201cChaos and abuses will be dealt with,\u201d it added. Protesters in Khartoum chanted: \u201cClose the street! Close the bridge! Burhan we will come straight to you,\u201d referring to military leader and sovereign council head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. \u201cDeparting from peacefulness, approaching and infringing on sovereign and strategic sites in central Khartoum is a violation of the laws,\u201d SUNA state news agency reported, citing a provincial security coordination committee. U.N. Special Representative to Sudan Volker Perthes urged Sudanese authorities not to stand in the way of Saturday\u2019s demonstrations.\n\nThe military could not immediately be reached for comment. Sources told Reuters they heard gunshots in the vicinity of the offices of UNAMID peacekeepers in Darfur on Saturday morning. \u201cFreedom of expression is a human right. This includes full access to the internet. According to international conventions, no one should be arrested for intent to protest peacefully,\u201d Perthes said. Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people marched to the presidential palace and security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters.\n\nForty-eight people have been killed in crack-downs on protests against the coup, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said.",

          "text": "Commercial airlines around the world canceled more than 5,900 flights over the Christmas weekend, as a mounting wave of COVID-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant created greater uncertainty and misery for holiday travelers.\n\nCommercial air traffic within the United States and into or out of the country accounted for more than a quarter of all the canceled flights over the weekend, FlightAware data showed.\n\nThe website showed that 1,779 Christmas Day flights were called off worldwide, along with 402 more that had been scheduled for Sunday.\n\nAirline carriers globally scrapped at least 2,401 flights on Friday, which fell on Christmas Eve and is typically a heavy day for air travel, according to a running tally on the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Nearly 10,000 more flights were delayed.\n\nAmong the first U.S. carriers to report a wave of holiday weekend cancellations were United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), which scrubbed nearly 280 flights combined on Friday alone, citing personnel shortages amid the surge of COVID-19 infections.\n\nCOVID-19 infections have surged in the United States in recent days due to the highly transmissible variant Omicron, which was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. cases and as many as 90% in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nOne in 20 Londoners had COVID-19 last week, a figure that could rise to one in 10 by early next week, according to data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nWhile recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness, and a lower rate of hospitalizations, than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook. \u201cThere is a glimmer of Christmas hope \u2026 but it definitely isn\u2019t yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat,\u201d Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC. Government data showed a record tally of 122,186 new infections nationwide on Friday, marking a third day in which the number of known cases has surpassed 100,000. France hit another COVID-19 infection record on Friday, with its daily tally exceeding 94,000 while hospitalizations from the virus reached a seven-month high, prompting the government to convene a special meeting for Monday that could trigger new public health restrictions.\n\nMoses Jimenez, an accountant from Long Beach, Mississippi, flew to New York with his wife and three children, even though the latest torrent of coronavirus cases dashed their hopes of catching a Broadway performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d or visit some museums. \u201cHamilton\u201d was one of a dozen productions to cancel shows this week as cast and crew members tested positive for COVID-19. Museums were scratched from the family\u2019s itinerary because many now require proof of vaccination and the two younger children are ineligible for the shot. Despite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season. Instead, Jimenez, 33, said his brood will make the best of roaming the city\u2019s streets and parks, while also seeing relatives and friends.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas,\u201d Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport. New York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases, capping the number of attendees 15,000. The Biden administration will next week lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the Omicron variant, the White House said.\n\nThe average number of new U.S. coronavirus cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nNew York reported more than 44,000 newly confirmed infections on Friday alone, shattering that state\u2019s daily record. At least 10 other states set new one-day case records on Thursday or Friday.",
