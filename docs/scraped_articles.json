          "title": "Odili\u2019s home raid: Disowning suspect doesn\u2019t exonerate AGF yet, says NBA investigator",
          "text": "The special investigator of the Nigerian Bar Association probing the invasion of Justice Mary Odili\u2019s home by security agents, Mr Monday Ubani, has said the parade of 14 suspects in Abuja by the police on Thursday is only the first step in the process of getting to the root of the matter.\n\nUbani, who was given the assignment last Friday by the NBA President, Mr Olumide Akpata, said the parade of the suspects had not vitiated his mandate.\n\nHe said the NBA\u2019s demand for the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to set up an independent panel of inquiry to look into the case and unravel the perpetrators still stood.\n\nUbani added that the fact that the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN), disowned the alleged arrowhead of the illegal operation, Lawrence Ajojo, was not enough to exonerate him.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with our correspondent on Friday, Ubani said, \u201cIt is the man\u2019s word against the AFG\u2019s, so it is subject to further investigation; it can\u2019t stop at that level. We need to get to the root of the matter to know who is actually lying between the AGF and the man.\u201d\n\nWhile reiterating that the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s home was a national embarrassment for Nigeria, Ubani added, \u201cWhat the NBA wants is to get to the root of the matter from our own perspective. The police are doing their own investigation by parading some persons; we (NBA) needs to reach out to those people and hear their own side of the story. That will make our work easier. It is also important to meet all the relevant persons that the NBA has asked me to meet in order to get to the root of this matter, so that we can present a detailed report to the NBA, which will help to deepen administration of justice in the country.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbanjo, has said Nigeria as a secular nation needs responsible political and religious leaders.\n\nAccording to him, a religious leader who preaches against another and a political leader who cannot carry everyone along are irreverent.\n\nHe spoke on Friday at the launch of a book titled, \u201cWinning leadership\u201d authored by Pat Akem.\n\nOsinbajo said, \u201cSo we are in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society and need responsible political leaders. We need responsible religious leaders, not those who are prepared to destroy the unity of the country so that they can be hailed by their parochial communities. A religious leader who preaches that we should hate other religions is not relevant today. I\u2019m a pastor, but I know that God loves Muslims. I must not discriminate against people of another faith.\n\n\u201cSo any religious leader who says that another religion should not exist is not relevant for our circumstances today and the same goes to our political leaders. Any political leader who doesn\u2019t recognise that this is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic society or any ethnic leader who doesn\u2019t recognise that it\u2019s a multi-ethnic society, and that you cannot function with one ethnic group and cannot carry everyone along is not relevant today.\u201d\n\nHe also said emphasis should be placed on the orientation of the elite, adding that the success or failure rested with them.\n\nOsinbajo said, \u201cI think a point that should be thrown up is the importance of the orientation of the elite in any society. Leaders are the elite in any society. These of course cover political, religious, ethnic, and corporate leaders. The elite are usually responsible for the failure or success of any society.\n\n\u201cIf the elites are selfish and self-seeking, our societies will be harmed.

          "text": "Sen. Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo\n\nThe Bayelsa Government has called on youths to support the fight against oil bunkering, illegal refining and other unwholesome activities that impact negatively on oil production and revenues accruing to the state.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Mr Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, made the call at a meeting with youth leaders from Ogbia Local Government Area, in Government House, Yenagoa, on Friday.\n\nEwhrudjakpo lamented the dwindling federal allocations to the state in recent times.\n\nThe deputy governor, who decried the sharp drop in Bayelsa\u2019s oil production, said several oil wells are operating at zero output level.\n\nHe blamed the development on the activities of oil thieves, illegal refining of crude and unnecessary stoppage of the operations of oil companies.\n\nHe said that the present administration would not support the oil companies to shortchange their host communities, saying there is the need for the people to channel their grievances to the government for amicable settlement.\n\nAccording to him, apart from the 13 per cent oil derivation, all the other parameters used by the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) for revenue sharing do not favour Bayelsa.\n\nHe, therefore, charged the youths to stand against any activity that would reduce the quantum of crude oil being produced in the state.\n\nEwhrudjakpo stressed that it was unjustifiable to complain against environmental degradation caused by oil companies, when people from the Niger Delta are also contributing to it through illegal refining of crude oil.\n\nThe deputy governor urged all stakeholders, including community leaders, to work closely with security agencies to stop the menace.\n\nHe maintained that illegal oil refining does not only endanger the health of the people but also destroys the environment of both the present and future generations.\n\nHis words: \u201cOur air is beginning to get polluted. We must all put our hands on deck to check this illegal refining of crude oil.\n\n\u201cAs I speak with you, our revenues are dropping rapidly. About 40 per cent of our oil wells in the state are reporting zero production and you know what that means.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop this, and it demands our collective efforts.\n\n\u201cOur youths should not at the slightest provocation go and block oil flow stations and manifolds, because it is what they produce from those flow stations that accumulate to become 13 per cent derivation.\n\n\u201cEvery other indicator for sharing revenue is skewed against Bayelsa So, we cannot afford to use our own hands to injure ourselves and be complaining at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Benjamin Okolo, a representative of Sector 2 Commander of Operation Delta Safe, Maj.

          "text": "Bauchi State Judiciary Service Commission on Friday cleared the air on rumours going on that it employed 18 upper area court judges, saying that it did not employ nor appoint new judicial officers, rather promoted deserving officers and also filled existing vacant positions in line with relevant laws.\n\nThe commission\u2019s clarification came on the heels of the state House of Assembly directive stopping further recruitment pending the outcome of the investigation of its Committee of Judiciary.\n\nReacting to the decision, the Chief Registrar of the State High Court, Barrister Subilim Emmanuel Danjuma, asserted that the judiciary in the state is not synonymous with the state Ministry of Justice, adding that judiciary is one of the three arms of government, others being executive and legislature.\n\nHe added that the Ministry of Justice has no supervisory functions on the judiciary in the state as such does not have power to recruit or appoint judges for the state judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe state judiciary is distinct from the state Ministry of Justice. The state judiciary is an organ of government just like the executive and the legislature constitutionally created under S. 6(2) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Justice is a legal department of the executive just like any other ministry. The Ministry of Justice has no supervisory role whatsoever over the Judiciary as that has never been envisaged by our Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt therefore goes without saying that the Ministry of Justice does not have power to recruit or appoint judges for the state judiciary. The appointment, promotion and discipline of judicial officers and staff of the judiciary strictly resides with the Judicial Service Commission, a body created under S. 197 (1)(c) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\n\u201cSo any purported exercise carried out by anybody or authority in respect of not only State judicial officers but even judicial staff is an exercise in futility,\u201d Danjuma stated.\n\nHe further stated that as a result of massive retirement of its personnel over the years, the Sharia Court of Appeal section had shortage of manpower both at its higher and lower bench.\n\nAccording to him, the commission sought the approval of the state governor to promote deserving and qualified lower judges to the rank of Upper Sharia judges to meet this shortfall.\n\nHe added that the governor granted the request and the management of the Sharia Court of Appeal shortlisted and submitted briefs on 36 Sharia judges to fill in the existing 18 vacancies in the 2021 approved personnel budget to the State Judicial Service Commission to be promoted to the position of Upper Sharia judges for its consideration.\n\nDanjuma informed that the commission at its meeting on 5th October 2021, considered and approved the promotion of 18 out of the 36 Sharia judges to the position of Upper Sharia judges in the exercise of its powers as contained in the constitution.\n\n\u201cTo set the records straight, the judiciary in Bauchi State and specifically the Sharia Court of Appeal section have a shortage of manpower both at its higher and lower bench. This is borne out of the massive retirement of its personnel overtime without replacement.\n\n\u201cThis can also be seen in the recent appointments of Grand Kadi and four Kadis that add up to the higher bench by His Excellency the Governor of Bauchi State. It is in this same vein that the Commission in its wisdom decided to seek consent and approval of the Governor to promote deserving and qualified lower judges to the rank of Upper Sharia Judges to meet this shortfall.\n\n\u201cThe Governor in his magnanimity granted the request. On its part, the management of the Sharia Court of Appeal shortlisted and submitted briefs on 36 Sharia judges to fill in the existing 18 vacancies in the 2021 Approved Personnel Budget to the Judicial Service Commission to be promoted to the position of Upper Sharia judges for its consideration.\n\n\u201cIt is of note that the Judicial Service Commission in its meeting Number 004 of 5th October 2021, considered and approved the promotion of 18 out of the 36 Sharia Judges to the position of Upper Sharia judges in the exercise of its powers under paragraphs 6 (c) of Part II (C) of the Third Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\u201d\n\nThe Chief Registrar, therefore, declared that no appointment was made by the commission as speculated, saying that what happened was promotion.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to note here that no appointment was made by the commission as is being mischievously circulated in the media. The seamless and unfair accusations that trail the promotions seems to connote that this modest exercise of promotion was irregular and lopsided,\u201d he clarified.\n\nDanjuma informed that appointment of judges was not only sensitive but also regulated by the National Judicial Policy, Judicial Appointments Guidelines and Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers.\n\nIn his words, \u201cwe are not here to join issues with anybody, but rather, we are here to explain to undiscerning minds that the appointment of judges, unlike other appointments is an exercise that is highly sensitive and regulated by the National Judicial Policy, Judicial Appointments Guidelines and Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers.\n\nHe noted that for the avoidance of doubt, every aspect of judicial appointment process should be such that would command public respect and confidence that the best person in terms of skill, learning, integrity and courage are appointed as judicial officers.\n\nAccording to Danjuma, \u201cit is a basic and fundamental aspect of the judicial policy that the judicial appointments process must be transparent and merit-based.\n\n\u201cIndeed the yardstick for appointment in terms of skill, competence, integrity and comportment shall not be compromised and shall be strictly observed. See Paragraph 2.1.4 of National Judicial Policy of April 2016.\u201d",

He said that the massive support the people gave him on November 6 was well appreciated and would not, for any reason, be taken for granted.\n\n\u201cInitially, there were tensed moments but this election happened in a unique way and we dedicate this victory to God and the people of Anambra who believed and gave us their mandate.\n\n\u201cWe will never take for granted the resilience, commitments and actions of the various federal institutions that worked so hard to see us to this day.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t fail to mention the Presidency, security agencies and INEC for insisting on a level playing field as well as the judiciary for standing on the path of integrity.\n\n\u201cI believe that a sound and credible electoral system is foundational to having an accountable, responsive and developmental state.\n\n\u201cSo, I believe that INEC is getting better by the day. I also believe that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) deployed, if refined, will give us that desired Eldorado in our electoral system\u201d, Soludo said.\n\nOkoye, in his speech, commended the members of staff of INEC and its ad-hoc workers for their doggedness, resilience and courage during the election; saying that they defied all the odds and grave dangers to personal life and safety to traverse the entire terrain of the state to conduct the poll.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will audit the conduct of this election as it is the tradition after every major election in order to reflect on things that worked well and those that failed to work as desired; and use the lessons learned in the preparation for the next set of elections.\n\n\u201cIt is in this regard and the benefits offered by the Electoral Cycle Approach adopted by the Commission that we now believe that the present trends of conducting elections imbued with integrity has become irreversible.\n\n\u201cWith specific reference to genuine concerns expressed by citizens on the performance of the BVAS in the November 6, 2021 Anambra governorship election, the Commission wishes to state categorically that it stands to benefit from such criticisms and promises that these challenges will be addressed as was evident in the improved functionality of the BVAS in the supplementary election in Ihiala Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cWe are confident in our judgment that the BVAS will remain a fundamental feature of our accreditation process as it will consign into the dustbin of history worrisome incidents of multiple voting and identity theft that in the past denied the country\u2019s electoral process the desired public trust and confidence. On this note, the Commission will continue to improve on and perfect the technology for subsequent and future elections\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Anambra, Dr Nwachukwu Orji, in his remarks, said that he was happy that the commission delivered an election adjudged credible by many people.\n\nRepresented by the Administrative Secretary of the Commission, Mr Chima Duruaku, the REC said that he was impressed and very much satisfied with the way the electorate conducted themselves before, during and even after the poll.\n\n\u201cThe calming of the storm that was raging very hard was divine and on human level, the commission was resolute to put in a lot of sacrifice, efforts and innovation to deliver.\n\n\u201cThe support of the security agencies, the National Youth Service Corps ( NYDC) and the military contributed to the success that we celebrate today.\n\n\u201cWe also commended the peaceful conduct of political parties inspite of the doomsday prediction and the singular resolve by the Anambra people that the election must be done\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Says Attorney General misleading President\n\n\u2022Alleges consultants\u2019 demands dubious, fraudulent\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) yesterday maintained that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami has continued to mislead President Muhammadu Buhari in the case of the $418 million (N169 billion at official FX rate) Paris Fund deductions being claimed by some consultants.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, in response to comments made on the matter earlier by Malami, the NGF Chairman, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, wondered why the attorney general was taking sides with people he described as \u201cdubious\u201d, instead of defending the country against them.\n\nThe federal government had approved the payment of the controversial sum to six creditors, in defiance of the issues raised by the 36 state governors on the legitimacy of the demands by the claimants.\n\nThe claimants included a former member of the House of Representatives, politician and lawyer, Ned Nwoko, who is demanding $142,028,941; and Riok Nigeria Limited, Orji Nwafor-Orizu, and Olaitan Bello, who are laying claims to $142,028,941.95, $1,219,440.45 and $215,159.36 respectively.\n\nAlso, Ted Iseghoghi is claiming $159,000,000, while a firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is claiming $47,831,920 in separate \u201cconsent judgments\u201d.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) was recently directed to commence issuance of promissory notes to the creditors, a development the governors have continued to resist.\n\nMalami had insisted that the consultants were deserving of the monies, from his own assessment of the situation, alleging that the governors had admitted to owing the debts and had actually been paying them off for some years.\n\nAccording to Malami, contrary to claims, the NGF had signed a contractual agreement authorising the deduction of fees from the federal allocation of the states as payments to consultants, who handled negotiations on behalf of the 36 States and FCT.\n\nHe had stated that having committed to the deduction of the fee from the federal allocation which the governors of the 36 states had signed to and which preceded the Buhari administration for which payments were made in the past, the federal government could not but follow through with the payment hence the recent approval to effect the payment to the consultants via promissory notes.\n\nBut speaking yesterday, Fayemi, who stated that he was ordinarily reluctant to discuss the matter since it was already in court, noted that the governors had held several consultations with Buhari, his chief of staff, the attorney general and the finance minister in the last eight months to sort out the contentious issues.\n\nHe upbraided the attorney general for publicly identifying himself as the attorney general of the federal government during his interview, noting that the office which Malami occupies exists to serve the federation and not the federal government.\n\nRather than defending the consultants, Fayemi insisted that Malami\u2019s job was to defend the federal, state and local governments which make up the federation.\n\nAccording to the Ekiti state governor, the consultants were taking advantage of Buhari\u2019s \u201cdecency and generosity of spirit\u201d to fleece the Nigerian people, having tried and failed during the administrations of Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umar Yar\u2019adua and Goodluck Jonathan to rip off the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cIt is not $418, it is $419 million and that may ring some bell in many places,\u201d he stressed, apparently referring to the term 419, the popular Nigerian word for fraud or scam.\n\nHe argued that there was no order of mandamus against the governors anywhere as alluded to by the attorney general and challenged Malami to produce the document if he\u2019s in possession of one.\n\nThe NGF chairman further pushed back on a statement made by Malami during the interview, that there exists a consent judgment confirming that the monies were owed the consultants and there was an agreement to pay, saying that there was nowhere in the so-called document that any amount was mentioned.\n\nHe mentioned that whatever consent judgment the consultants claimed to have obtained was entered into by a faction of the governors\u2019 forum in the days when the then chair of the NGF, Rotimi Amaechi, was purportedly removed, maintaining that Amaechi\u2019s NGF which was the authentic body never sanctioned the deal.\n\nHe stated that not even the best lawyers in the United Kingdom would NOT charge those huge amounts for a \u201ctwo-page letter\u201d purportedly given to the faction of the governors\u2019 forum on review of the judgment, insisting that it doesn\u2019t appeal to common sense.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general of the federation is pushing so vehemently on the side of people whose primary intent is to fleece the Nigerian people. Even the EFCC that reviewed all of these matters, actually accused the federal ministry of justice of lack of diligent prosecution of this matter.\n\n\u201cThese matters were not appealed by the federal ministry of justice, admittedly not under Malami at the time. But what is happening now is just a continuation of the sleight of hand and that\u2019s what the governors are challenging.\n\n\u201cI wrote to the president on behalf of my colleagues, sat with Mr. President on this issue and clearly Mr. President was misled and there\u2019s no way governors are going to allow this.\n\n\u201cI will ordinarily not come out and do this, but my brother Abubakar Malami directed his media aides to accuse governors of being the ones behind this and he has repeated on your programme (on Arise Television) that we are forum-shopping,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that Malami\u2019s claims that part of the monies had been offset in the past and therefore was a basis for further deductions did not hold water, since it was possible to obtain money by fraudulent means, but that the governors are now insisting that the right thing should be done.\n\nFayemi pointed out that since the activities of public servants would be scrutinised by the public at some point after they exit their positions, it was imperative to display the highest form of transparency in all their dealings.\n\n\u201cI am afraid that we do not believe that the attorney general has demonstrated this (transparency) and that\u2019s what has brought this about,\u201d he declared.\n\nAsked to confirm if the EFCC verified the amount being claimed by the consultants, he stated that it wasn\u2019t possible, reason the governors had been calling for a forensic audit, since members of the anti-corruption agency are not forensic auditors.\n\nFor instance, he stated that the EFCC report revealed that one of the documents which was used to claim the huge amount by one of the consultants was forged, describing the whole matter as clouded with a lot of \u201cmalfeasance\u201d.\n\nHe questioned why the attorney general, who is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) was in a hurry to execute the so-called judgment of the lower courts when the governors had appealed the matter in a higher court.\n\nHe explained that because governors wanted access to the Paris Club fund when Buhari agreed to disburse it in 2017, they had some agreements with certain parties who had gone to court to block the money from being released, but noted that whatever they got was the full and final payment.\n\nOn the accusation of forum-shopping, he described the allegation by Malami as \u201cingenuous\u201d, alleging that the directive by the attorney general for the release of the monies was basically to rip Nigerians off.\n\nFayemi stressed that it was an \u201cinsult\u201d for the attorney general to insinuate that the governors were forum-shopping, a practice where a party attempts to have his action tried in a particular court or jurisdiction where he feels he will receive the most favourable decision or verdict.\n\n\u201cWe have been very clear that these claims, to the best of our knowledge are fraudulent and should be subjected to a forensic audit.\n\n\u201cIf states are found to be liable on account of the purported consultancy allegedly delivered by these people, because I don\u2019t know how anybody can claim to have delivered on the refund that is already established, for anyone to suggest that they did that is a red herring.\n\n\u201cThe best way to describe this 419 million dollars is to say that this is a local equivalent of the P&ID case and it\u2019s an irony that the attorney general is the one prosecuting the P&ID all over the place and trying to rescue $10 billion for the Nigerian people and yet is so willing to release $419 million to people of dubious circumstances who are demanding for the money I don\u2019t believe they worked for.\u201d\n\nBut an analyst of the development who does not want his name mentioned. told THISDAY that it would be disingenuous for Malami to continue to push for the payment of such a huge amount of money at this point in time when the economy is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19, the consequent slump in federal government\u2019s revenue and its inability to meet its OPEC daily crude export quota . \u201cAll these challenges have made the federal government to remain in the debt market, borrowing monies from every available avenue to meet its obligations.\n\nTherefore, under the situation that the country finds itself, managers of the nation such as Malami should be more concerned about efforts to reflate the economy and should not be seen as the one encouraging steps that would further make the economy bleed.\n\nAt a time like this, focus should be on how to spend our way out of the present economic situation and on job creation for our huge youth population so as to raise productivity. All Malami is interested is paying consultants dubious consent judgment;\n\nThe analyst argued further that whether the governors initially allowed deductions to take place in 2016, \u201cdoes not hold water because the variables available then are not the same as 2021 and there are now different players entirely who have looked at matter and realised something is not quite right in the all scheme. More so, when the deal was consummated in 2016, the dollar was around N150/$1 and now he is pushing for the consultants to be paid at around N450/$. We are talking about a colossal amount of money to be paid to a few people to the detriment of over 200 million people. This is just immoral however one looks at it, said the analyst.\n\n\u201cClearly, as the chief law officer of the country, Malami should know that all his actions on this matter are not morally right and purely against public interest and it would be immoral for the president to even endorse the payment.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 THISDAY disowns Stanley Nkwazema, says he left company over 15 years ago\n\n\u00b7 Malami denies group leader\n\nAlex Enumah and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Police yesterday paraded 14 suspects allegedly involved in the invasion of the Abuja residence of Supreme Court Justice, Mrs. Mary Odili.\n\nTHISDAY disowned one of the suspects, Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, who claimed to be a staff and contributing editor of the newspaper.\n\nSimilarly, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, distanced himself from the leader of the group that conducted the raid, Lawrence Ajodo, who claimed to be a consultant to the AGF.\n\nA group that claimed to be personnel of some security agencies, including the police, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Department of State Services (DSS), among others, had invaded the home of the Odilis on October 29. The invasion drew wide condemnation from individuals and organisation, including the judiciary, Senate, the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Ohaneze Ndigbo, Afenifere, and other socio-cultural groups and civil society organisations.\n\nEFCC Chairman, Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, had denied involvement of the agency in the raid, while the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, in ordering investigation into the incident also denied involvement of the police in the matter.\n\nBut parading the suspects at the Force CID in Abuja, Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the investigation was predicated on a petition submitted by Malami directing the Inspector General of Police to conduct a robust investigation into the matter. Mba said 14 suspects were arrested while seven were at large, even as he said detectives were working round the clock to apprehend others still at large.\n\nHe said the leader of the syndicate, Ajodo, who claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), was an impostor.\n\n\u201cHe is an impostor, not one of us or other law enforcement agencies in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nMba said the syndicate obtained a search warrant based on false representation. He said the identity card found on him containing the signature of the AGF was forged.\n\nMba said the invasion was a well-conceived one with actors drawn from different professional backgrounds, notably, law, journalism, and rogue law enforcement. He said one of the suspects, Yusuf Adamu of the Bauchi State Liason Office, had claimed that there was a large deposit of hard currency in the home of the Odilis.\n\nMba said a prayer warrior, Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, who was contacted by an alleged Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) staff had gone to Odili\u2019s house to get soil sample of the place which confirmed the existence of the hard currency in the residence. He said the syndicate contacted a staff of EFCC, Austin, who was at large, and two lawyers, Barristers Igwe and Lawrence, and a journalist, Nkwazema.\n\nNkwazema claimed he was investigating an exclusive story. But Mba said the police doubted him because he did not report the story before it broke and long after it broke, until police invited him.\n\nMba said all the suspects attended all the meetings before the invasion and were all there on the night of the invasion. He said the security men at Odili\u2019s residence should be commended for observing that the search warrant contained No 7 instead of No 9.\n\nAccording to Mba, \u201cThis action saved the nation what would have been an embarrassment. The investigation has been swift, intelligence-led and comprehensive. Any of the suspects currently at large will be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted other security agencies, whose personnel are among those at large.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesman said no staff of the Ministry of Justice was involved in the operation.\n\nBut a man, who claimed to be the whistle-blower, an Islamic prayer warrior and swore to an affidavit that there was looted money in the house, said the information he was given was authentic. He alleged that he was called by the EFCC, after which they all assembled at the Ministry of Justice, where they demanded for the affidavit that he submitted, prompting surveillance on the home of Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cI showed him Justice Odili\u2019s house,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nMba declared, \u201cAt the end, all would be charged to court based on their level of involvement.\u201d\n\nHe said the charges might include conspiracy, impersonation, and forgery.\n\nHowever, Ajodo, insisted that he was one of the five consultants appointed by the office of the AGF and that he was mandated to recover stolen funds lodged in 18 accounts.\n\nResponding to questions during their parade, Ajodo said he was neither a personnel of the police nor worked for the AGF, but maintained his position that he was one of the consultants mandated to recover 18 accounts. He said the search was not executed on the night of the invasion because the house number on the warrant was No 7 and not No 9 Imo Crescent, the residence of the Justice, which prompted them to call off the search.\n\n\u201cI was given18 accounts to recover. I am a consultant, one of the five engaged in that office (AGF),\u201d Ajodo insisted.\n\nHowever, the web of denial of involvement by security agencies appears to be punctured by the accounts of the police and the suspects.\n\nFor instance, the police said two soldiers, a police ASP, an immigration officer, and an EFCC staff, who were allegedly involved in the raid, were at large. Those who raided Odili\u2019s residence were also said to be about 50.\n\nThese raise the question how, suddenly, the paraded suspects are only civilians \u2013 lawyer, journalist, native doctor \u2013 or fake policemen or suspects, who forged search warrants for the operation.\n\nTHISDAY Disowns Stanley Nkwazema\n\nMeanwhile, the management of THISDAY Newspapers, in a disclaimer notice signed by the Managing Editor, Mr. Bolaji Adebiyi, stated categorically that Nkwazema was neither a staff nor a Contributing Editor of the organisation.\n\nThe notice dated November 11, read, in part, \u201cThe attention of the management of THISDAY Newspapers has been drawn to the news making the rounds that Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, one of those suspected to have invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili, claimed to be a staff and Contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claim, Mr. Nkwazema is neither a staff of THISDAY nor a Contributing Editor.

          "text": "\u2022Flays uneven distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between developed and developing nations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, France\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said his administration had invested extensively in critical infrastructure and economic projects, stressing that the possibilities being created through the investments for Nigerians and foreigners are enormous. Buhari also declared that investment in gas was a top priority of his government, as it had huge benefits in terms of financial returns and generation of power.\n\nThe president spoke in Paris while playing host to Managing Director of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Dr. Mohammed Al-Jasser, and Chief Executive Officer of Total Energies, Patrick Pouyanne, on the sidelines of the three-day Paris Peace Forum (PPF), which began in the French capital on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting with the IDB boss, Buhari emphasised his administration\u2019s commitment to infrastructural renaissance for Nigeria, saying, \u201cWe are struggling very hard on infrastructure, because there can\u2019t be sustainable development without it.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen infrastructure is in place, our people can look after themselves.\u201d\n\nThe president emphasised that looking at the vastness of the country, \u201cWe need roads, rail, power, airports, housing, and that is what we have engaged ourselves with in the past six years.\n\n\u201cAnd our people are seeing the new developments. Relative to the resources available to us, we have not done badly.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated IDB for its support so far, saying; \u201cWhat we are so dependent on (crude oil) has lost a lot of energy. It is coming back gradually, and we are breathing a bit more with some confidence. But we expect greater cooperation from you.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Al-Jasser said he was glad to see the level of collaboration between Nigeria and IDB since he assumed office three months ago. He told Buhari that he was impressed by Nigeria\u2019s policies on infrastructure, saying it would give \u201copportunities to youths, and encourage the private sector.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNigeria is a pivotal country to us, and it deserves all the help it can get.\u201d\n\nThe IDB boss said the main role of the bank was to promote development among its stakeholders, saying it would continue to lend a helping hand to Nigeria.\n\nBuhari stated when he received Pouyanne that Nigeria had made huge investments in gas, adding that the country would continue to create opportunities for expansion, while looking at creating alternatives with renewable energy. He said Nigeria was mindful of the target of zero emission by 2060, and had started putting in place structures to ensure balance and safety for citizens and the global community.\n\nIn his remarks, the CEO of Total said the French oil giant had been greatly encouraged by the support for investors in Nigeria. He said the company would continue to explore and pursue opportunities of mutual interest.\n\nPouyanne noted that the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), led by Mele Kyari, had provided a strong support base and partnership for growth, assuring that investments in the gas sector would be sustained with consideration for renewable energy.\n\nDuring the opening of the three-day forum yesterday, Buhari flayed the disparity in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines between developed and developing nations since the pandemic broke out last year. He canvassed an end to the hoarding of vaccines by lifting export restrictions imposed by some countries.\n\nDelivering a keynote address entitled, \u201cLessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Importance of Coordination Among All Actors for Vaccine Delivery,\u201d at the forum, which held at Grande Halle de la Villette in Paris, Buhari submitted that the coordination for distribution of the vaccines needed to be total while the objective had to be the same to deliver vaccines to the world.\n\nAccording to him, the state of vaccine delivery across the world leaves much to be desired.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have a situation where some countries are giving booster third doses for their citizens when millions across the world, especially in the developing world, are yet to receive a single dose.\n\n\u201cLet us compare vaccination rates to give an idea of the dimension of the problem. According to recent data, as of 4th November 2021, 91.3 doses of vaccine had been given for every 100 persons across the world. On the same date, however, only 14.7 doses of vaccine per 100 persons had been administered in Africa \u2013 a clear case of lop-sidedness.\n\n\u201cAccording to Bloomberg, countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated ten times faster than those with the lowest income.\n\n\u201cAs of 5th November 2021, Africa had fully vaccinated 77 million persons, amounting to just six per cent of the continent\u2019s population. By comparison, 60 per cent of the European Union population had been fully vaccinated by September 2021. This massive gap between vaccine requirements in Africa and vaccine availability is undermining the fight against the coronavirus pandemic on the continent. Even if Africa were to receive the 600 million doses of vaccine expected to be delivered to the continent by the end of 2021 under the COVAX arrangement, there would still be a considerable shortfall when compared to the population of the continent which currently stands at 1.383 billion.\u201d\n\nQuoting the World Health Organisation (WHO), Buhari stressed that even the planned COVAX deliveries to Africa had been cut by 25 per cent due to supply shortages and export bans.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a major setback for Africa, where it is estimated that COVID-19 vaccine deliveries have to increase from around 20 million doses a month to an average of 150 million doses a month if the target of fully vaccinating 70 per cent of its population by September 2022 is to be achieved.\n\n\u201cSo, what needs to be done to plug the gap? How can vaccine availability in Africa be boosted? Who needs to do what?\u201d\n\nThe president urged world leaders and global health institutions to follow a regime of enabling access to the COVID-19 vaccines, cautioning that sidelining countries in terms of reach will undermine the entire effort.\n\nHe emphasised that export restrictions that encourage needless hoarding of vaccines needed to be lifted, while welcoming pledges by industrialised countries to share vaccines.\n\nBuhari said pledges should be fulfilled in a timely manner, as he appreciated some countries, like France, that had donated vaccines to developing countries.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cResolving supply-chain constraints would require better coordination within the manufacturing process; and between manufacturers and end-users.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear need for the expansion of vaccine production capacity in Africa. In this regard, African countries already have a roadmap: the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa (PMPA) developed in 2007 by the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) on the basis of an African Union Summit decision taken in 2005.\n\n\u201cLicensing agreements should be reached with pharmaceutical companies for the transfer of intellectual property and technology to support the production of vaccines in Africa. If global vaccination is the only way to end the COVID-19 pandemic, then all stakeholders must act in a coordinated manner to plug the vaccine supply gap in Africa.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

When Buratai was the Chief of Army Staff, he allowed the training to take place in Falgore. After then, they were supposed to proceed to Jaji, Armed Forces Command School, Jaji, to continue their training but Attahiru cancelled that particular recruitment whereas money had been released for it.\n\n\u201dAttahiru before now had pleaded with Buratai when Buratai was Chief of Army Staff to allow his niece and someone get into the army but Buratai refused; so when Attahiru came into power, he was trying to pay back and cancelled the DSSC 26.\n\n\u201cIt has never happened in the history of the Nigerian Army. We were expecting that whatever the delay might be would be resolved, but it is over 9 months now. Usually by August, the Nigerian Army would have released names for new intakes. The one they cancelled was DSSC 26 and now the Nigerian Army has not done anything about it but the money they have taken from the budget allocated for that, where is it?\u201d",

          "title": "Fixing Nigeria, Before The Fall: Full Text Of Trending Press Address By Leader Of Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo",
          "text": "Gentlemen of the Press,\n\nIn the 93 years of God\u2019s special Grace of my life, over 70 of which I have relentlessly spent in the struggle for a united, civilised, prosperous and federal Republic of Nigeria, and I have waited for some time in the departure lounge of life, and I owe it to posterity, to speak unalloyed truth to unconscionable powers, and to clarify the position of my people, the Yoruba of the Nigerian state, so that whenever I might be recalled home, it shall be said of me, that I not only did my bit, I indeed said my bit, and the position of the Yoruba people and Afenifere, were clearly and succinctly enunciated.\n\nIn spite of deepening disappointments, the Nigerian Press has stood as, perhaps, the last and only beacon of hope in that\n\nrealisation. I have invited you here today, therefore, as partners in that shared vision so that, through you, President Muhammadu Buhari and other political actors, blinded by ambition, may see the need to fix Nigeria before the imminent eclipse of her horizon.\n\nNigeria is dying. To be sure, the Nigerian state that was negotiated before independence in 1960, the one that was birthed and named on the 1st of October 1960, is long dead. It was mortally wounded in January 1966, and was then slaughtered in July of 1966. Its funereal obsequies were held between 1966-1970. The Frankenstein that was cobbled together in place of the dead nation that was agreed, has survived this long on the back of repression, lies, illusions, and outright delusions. But Buhari has finally killed it by his endless arrogance, the manifest incompetence, and the vile ethnoreligious agenda, with which he is dangerously strangle the insufferable Frankenstein.\n\nThe Nigeria that was agreed, is one that was deliberately FEDERAL in structure. The Nigeria that was AGREED, was by design, based on a parliamentary system of governance. The Nigeria that was agreed, was one that recognized the rights of the federating regions, to nationhood within the ambit of the FEDERATION that was birthed. The Nigeria that was agreed was not a perfect place, but neither is anything constructed by men, and the proof of its imperfections are embedded in the tragedies of the civil war that buried it.\n\nI am constrained by the limitations of time to adumbrate, and I shall fast forward to the emergence of Abdusalami and the transition to civilian rule in 1999.\n\nIt was the position of Afenifere and NADECO, that there existed an urgent need to convene a Sovereign National Conference of the ethnic nationalities that have become known as Nigerians. Afenifere\u2019s position has not evolved. We remain convinced that the need for a sovereign national conference is imperative. THE BASIS OF THE NIGERIAN STATE MUST BE CLEARLY NEGOTIATED.\n\nWe have heard and read countless ripostes to our considered position, many have pointed to Decree 24 of 1999, the same fraudulent document that is infamously known as the 1999 Constitution, and asserted that there is no need for an SNC, as the country already has a constitution. We disagree most vehemently, and INSIST, that Nigeria is not possessed of any expression of the WILL of the peoples, whose will it presumes to fraudulently appropriate.\n\nIt is instructive to note, that when the Midwestern Region was to be created out of the Western Region, a rigorous process was embarked upon. The motion for its creation went through the Western Regional Assembly, and the Federal House of Representatives in Lagos, and the peoples of the proposed region voted for its creation in a plebiscite. This only after the fact of its economic viability had been scientifically established. This rigorous process birthed the additional region that was created in 1962, and duly established under the 1963 Republican constitution.\n\nNigeria is today a Frankenstein with 36 states. How many of these states are viable entities that would have passed the 1962-1963 means testing of the Midwestern Region? By whose will were they created? Whose interests are they serving? The Nigeria that has been set up for failure by these evil restructuring is visibly bleeding to death and is in its death throes on Buhari\u2019s watch.\n\nThe entire country is burning. The Northeast was already aflame before the coming of Buhari, its peoples rendered as pawns in the power games of the northern elite, who allowed Boko haram to fester as the evil powers of the federal government was lost to them, and the insurgents were seen as ethnic champions, indeed, Buhari protested about the onslaught on Boko haram, and for those who might have paid attention, Gumi\u2019s interventions are merely aping what Buhari used to say, before he gained office in 2015. But what used to be confined to the northeast, has today become a pan Nigerian problem.\n\nThe terrorists have crossed into the northwest and as they have ravaged the entire region including the president\u2019s home state, kidnapping hundreds of schoolchildren and their teachers, raping and pillaging the land, the Buhari regime has treated them with kids gloves, and have blithely labeled them as bandits, businessmen, vandals, and even recently as Area Boys. Train track bombers, who were clearly intent on the derailment of a passenger train, are labeled as vandals in a clear advertisement of the complicity of the Buhari regime in the terrorist led insurgency, ravaging Nigeria.\n\nIn the Middle belt, what were once episodic outbursts of Fulani herdsmen and farmers conflicts, a conflict as old as man, has acquired a most evil dimension. The Buhari that stormed the Government House in Ibadan during the administration of Late Alhaji Lam Adesina, is the one established inside Aso Rock, and the extreme nepotism of the man, his unbridled Islamist irredentism, are not only intact, they are unfettered by any pretense at presidential leadership. \u201cBe your brother\u2019s keepers\u201d was Buhari\u2019s response to the slaughter in the Benue debacle, and \u201cgive up your land in order to live\u201d was the spokesman\u2019s recommendation to the victims.\n\nIn the southeast, in the lands of the Igbo people, Gen. Buhari has been most indecorous with his words, but his actions are even worse than his words, and he has effectively lost control of the East. The Anambra elections are instructive on several fronts, and I shall return to the subject soon enough, but the facts of the restiveness of the East, is not a fact that might be said to be either in issue, or in dispute, and yes, this is without having factored in the existence of pockets of Fulani terrorists, in parts of Igboland.\n\nThe South-South has been up in arms for a while, and the Niger Delta is essentially a war zone. These are the realities of the Niger Delta, where the wealth being evilly dissipated around the length of Nigeria originates, but where all of the Nigerian deprivations are curated. The environment is even more violent, rendered so by decades of criminal exploitation of its land and peoples by the Nigerian state, and just as volatile as the hydrocarbons that are being taken from its bowels. The Niger Delta is a volcano waiting to erupt, and the PIA is poised to ignite it.\n\nThe southwest, home to the Yoruba people and all men and women of goodwill, whom we have always welcomed, and who have made our lands their homes, have never had it so bad. Our hospitality has been violently abused, our generosity of spirit, taken for granted, and the security of lives and properties wickedly undermined. Bands of Fulani terrorists are in our forests and farms, they rape, rob, kidnap, and TERRORIZE the people. They bear arms brazenly and they act above the law, and when our people respond in self protection, they are victimized by the Nigerian police and the army, which have acted to establish presidential complicity.\n\nI have pondered Chief Awolowo\u2019s words in his 1981 public letter to Alhaji Shagari, and I have found a part to be metaphysically intriguing, even though it has only served to deepen my alarm, such that I believe that I owe it to posterity to place my fears on the record; \u201cthe ship of state is fast approaching a huge rock and, unless you, as the chief helmsman, quickly rise to the occasion and courageously steer the ship away from its present course, it shall hit the rock, and the inescapable consequence will be an unspeakable disaster such as is rare in the annals of man\".\n\nBuhari was to be that disastrous rock a few months after the warning. The problem with the rock this time, is that the rock is the helmsman of the ship, and he would appear to be DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY steering the ship to its END.\n\nThe Nigeria cobbled together by Decree 24, of 1999, yes, you get it. FRAUDULENTLY known as the 1999 Constitution, is built on several lies, and the preservation of these lies, are predicated on several more lies. Buhari, is unilaterally imposing another lie, on top of the original lies, and these lies, are what have assured the death of Nigeria. The Fulani Islamist agenda of the Buhari regime has found accommodation for each and every one of the public rebuttals of the lies of Nigeria.\n\nConfronted with repeated questions about the identity of the sponsors of terrorism, that were discovered by the intelligence services of one of the Gulf Arab countries, and the fact of the convictions of several Nigerian citizens by that country, the Buhari regime, was unequivocal in showing where its preferences and loyalties are;\n\n\u201cNaming and shaming of suspects is not embarked upon as a policy by the federal Government out of sheer respect for the constitutional rights of Nigerians relating to presumption of innocence.\u201d Abubakar Malami SAN, AGF. But it is curious to note, that the same government, is quick to rush to the media, to declare the identities of those that it has declared to be the sponsors of Sunday Igboho, and Nnamdi Kanu., and the greatest victories of the Buhari regime, in its incestuous relationship with corruption, has been won in the media. The speed with which it labels voices of dissent as terrorists, whilst ignoring and outrightly colluding with self declared terrorists, renders the Buharist regime a proven accomplice to the terrorist network that is destroying the country.\n\nCommodore Olawunmi is on record as saying that the security services had submitted a report to General Buhari since 2017, and that a list of the names of the major sponsors of terrorism in Nigeria is one of the several pieces of information in that file. He went further to affirm, that several of these positively identified terrorists and terrorist sponsors, are today sitting in the Buharist government at the highest level, and many more are serving senators and governors. The fact of Buhari\u2019s terrorists sympathies are too glaring to require any proof beyond the demand that a man should believe the evidence of his own senses.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal in an exclusive piece, REVEALED THAT THE NIGERIAN MILITARY HAS been dealing with terrorists, and in the particular instance, BOUGHT BACK from the terrorists, an ANTI AIRCRAFT GUN, that the terrorists had captured from a unit of the army, because the presence of the piece in the hands of the terrorists, was a direct risk to Buhari himself, who was apparently scheduled for an appointment in his hometown. If they knew the location of the terrorists to exchange guns for cash, they most definitely could have bombed the terrorists, instead of paying them off, but how do you bomb \u201cbusinessmen\u201d \u201cbandits\u201d \u201cvandals\u201d? The terrorists are called several names but are rarely called what they are. Welcome to the land of REPENTANT BANDITS AND VANDALS. THE COUNTRY WITH THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DERADICALIZATION in the world.\n\nI shall not waste any more time to establish the facts of Buhari\u2019s ethnoreligious bigotry, he has saved everyone the task of doing that, he happily wears his ethnic and religious supremacist uniforms, and has never pretended to be anything else, but the time has come to state to the whole world as follows.\n\nWe shall be seeking to persuade our people to avoid being lured into a legitimization of Buhari\u2019s ethnoreligious agenda by engaging with the patently fraudulent lies of any elections in 2023, in the absence of a restoration of peace, and a substantial restructuring of a NEGOTIATED Nigeria.\n\nWE ARE NOT ANARCHISTS, WE ARE NOT SESSIONISTS, we are DEMOCRATS. We recognize that there is a democratically elected president in Aso Rock. We are not asking for Buhari\u2019s resignation, and since the National Assembly has not seen fit to impeach him, he remains the president of Nigeria until the 27th of May, 2023. But it is the considered position of Afenifere that he urgently constitutes a Government Of National Unity, charged with the sole task of seeing to the restructuring of Nigeria, in consultation with the Nigerian peoples.\n\nThe Buhari regime has no plans for any elections in 2023, and this statement is not a difficult proposition to establish, once the parties to the debate, are fully seized, of their faculties. Anambra should be useful in ESTABLISHING this obvious fact.\n\nAS BAD AS THE SECURITY SITUATION IN ANAMBRA MIGHT BE, it is nowhere near as bad as the situation in the NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, or the MIDDLE-BELT, and the rest of Nigeria is hardly at peace.\n\nBy official accounts, outside of the ones that might be deployed to carry their Oga\u2019s briefcases or to hold umbrellas, the Nigerian Police deployed 34K officers to Anambra for the November 6 elections. I am not sure if these are in addition to the ones that were already under the state police command, or if these 34K is the totality of the men. But it is important to note that these 34K represents approximately 10% of the entire capacity of the Nigerian police, if we are to accept the official numbers without considering the inherent lies that have been told to accommodate the ghosts. It is interesting to note, that for every three persons that voted in the Anambra mockery of democracy, there was a policeman, Civil Defence, or military personnel. THE ELECTION HELD, ONLY BECAUSE IT PLEASED IPOB TO CALL A TRUCE.\n\nIn the face of the facts and realities, the Buhari regime has labeled self determination groups as terrorists, gone to extraordinary lengths to abduct MNK, invaded the home of Sunday Igboho and murdered two innocent men in cold blood, chased the same Igboho into Benin Republic, but rolls out the red carpets for terrorists. The same Buhari regime had labeled the just and peaceful demands of Omoyele Sowore\u2019s RevolutionNow Movement as terrorist, and judicially curtailed his freedom. It is easy to see through the multiple lies of General Buhari if one is minded to look, but the question is, IS ANYONE LOOKING AT US AGAIN?\n\nThe world would appear to be tired of Nigeria, and the preoccupation of the world is fixed on a containment of the nuisance that we have become, because if the world has any care left for us, how has it found the grace of condonement, acquiescence, and obvious complicity? How has the cause of liberty been promoted in Nigeria by the British and the Americans? With ALL of their eyes in the Nigerian skies, what did they see on the 20th of October at Lekki. The Western world has found accommodation for evil in Nigeria. But if Harold Smith is to be believed, the ruination of Nigeria by the British is not an accident, it is by design.\n\nLet it be heard loud and clear; Afenifere shall be leading the Yoruba nation to demand substantial restructuring, before any FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS might be held in 2023, and the response of the Buharist regime to these equitable demands for restructuring the country along federalist lines, in order to restore it to its roots and original agreements, shall go a long way in shaping the position of the Yoruba people in the future, but let it be heard loud and clear; NIGERIA IS NOT ONLY NEGOTIABLE, IT IS EVIDENTLY DYING.\n\nGen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd) to keep Nigeria one, is it for the Fulani to dominate other ethnic nationalities?\n\nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo (rtd), Nigeria unity is non-negotiable, for the Yorubas to be under Fulani domination?\n\nYour Eminence Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, Gen. Abdusulami Abubakar (rtd), Bishop Kukah, can we have peace without equity and justice?\n\nGOD SAVE NIGERIA\n\nCHIEF AYO ADEBANJO\n\nLeader of Afenifere\n\nLagos\n\n11/11/2021",
          "summary": "In spite of deepening disappointments, the Nigerian Press has stood as, perhaps, the last and only beacon of hope in thatrealisation.\nTo be sure, the Nigerian state that was negotiated before independence in 1960, the one that was birthed and named on the 1st of October 1960, is long dead.\nTHE BASIS OF THE NIGERIAN STATE MUST BE CLEARLY NEGOTIATED.\nThe Fulani Islamist agenda of the Buhari regime has found accommodation for each and every one of the public rebuttals of the lies of Nigeria.\nThe same Buhari regime had labeled the just and peaceful demands of Omoyele Sowore\u2019s RevolutionNow Movement as terrorist, and judicially curtailed his freedom.",

          "title": "Where is Africa\u2019s digital media landscape headed?",
          "text": "Digital media in Africa is growing fast: traditional media organisations are finding their way to the internet while digital-only media organisations are taking firm root. More Africans are online, they are spending more time on the internet and relying more on digital media more than ever. According to the Social Flagship Report April 2021, created by Global Web Index (GWI), four African countries cracked the top 10 rankings for social media usage based on time spent, as Nigeria ranked first at (3:46), followed by Kenya (3:33), South Africa (3:32) and Ghana.\n\nOn the latest edition of TechCabal Live\u2014a video interview series in partnership with the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub\u2014held on October 25, we sought to understand Africa\u2019s digital media landscape, its challenges and future, and so we spoke with the editors of two of Africa\u2019s top digital newsrooms\u2014Quartz Africa Editor, Ciku Kimeria; and Stears Business\u2019, Editor-in-Chief, Fadekemi Abiru.\n\nHow can digital media in Africa create a profitable business model?\n\nWhile it is normal to get excited about the different innovative news products in the continent\u2019s digital media landscape, Abiru explains that more media houses need to produce more information that helps people understand what is going on around them.\n\nIn Africa, online news is mostly free. Only a few digital news organisations have been able to monetise their digital content. But Abiru wants this to change. \u201cLet people understand that information is something worth paying for. There is a challenge of helping people understand that where there is value, revenue can also be generated.\u201d Abiru believes that value creation is enough reason for digital media in Africa to monetise their online content. She further explains that the concept of \u201ccontent worth paying for\u201d is why Netflix and Spotify operate subscription-based business models.\n\nAbiru believes that for African newsrooms to use the subscription model successfully, they must produce deep, original and insightful pieces that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAfrican newsrooms have a talent problem\n\nAbiru complained about a talent shortage and the challenge of retaining talent. Ciku also believes that Africa faces a talent problem but is hopeful that training would go a long way to solve it. She added, though, that it is easier to train good writers on technical skills but very hard to teach good writing.\n\nQuality of work coming from African newsrooms must improve\n\nSpeaking on the quality of journalistic work coming out of African newsrooms, Ciku believes that there is a huge gap between African and, say, American journalism. But she believes the fault isn\u2019t entirely the journalist\u2019s. She says there has been a drop in the quality of journalism schools in Kenya, her home country.\n\nAnother reason for this drop in the quality of journalism is the university system in Africa, where there are scandals of people paying for their degrees.\n\n\u201cNow, when you read what a journalist has written, there are so many typos and errors,\u201d she lamented.\n\nYet another problem Ciku highlighted was funding. She believes African journalists can do amazing work, but their budget is way smaller than that of global publications.\n\n\u201cIf a great investigative journalist wants to go into a project in a place that\u2019s not safe, and his organisation gives him little or no money to do so, you can understand how they will not come up with the same quality of work as a global media house.\u201d\n\nThe major cause of the funding problem, Ciku said, is the environment and not individual journalists.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conversation below:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to secure funding for your early-stage startup in Africa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators.

          "title": "Ghana mobile money revenue offers clues to MTN Nigeria\u2019s PSB expectation",
          "text": "The share of the mobile money market and the value of transactions controlled by MTN Ghana may have helped unravel a picture of what to expect from the Nigerian business when MTN kicks off its payment service bank (PSB) in the next six months.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted approval in principle to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa to operate payment service banks (PSBs), with final approval to follow in six months, subject to specific requirements.\n\nControlling about 85 percent of the mobile money market in Ghana, the MTN subsidiary in the West African country raked in revenues of GH\u00a2 1.26 billion (N84.97billion) in the nine months through September 2021, according to its financial statements.\n\nWhile the regulations governing the Nigerian mobile money industry and the level of development in the country\u2019s financial services industry differ from what is available in Ghana, the MTN MoMo business in Ghana is similar to what MTN Nigeria will be able to do in Africa\u2019s largest economy. Although the Nigerian PSB licence doesn\u2019t give room for the operators to do as much as their Ghana counterparts.\n\nUnlike in Ghana, Nigeria\u2019s PSB operators cannot provide lending and insurance products. Also, their interest-bearing assets are limited to government and central bank-issued instruments. Lending, according to market analysts, can be a profitable add-on for digital payments providers and the restrictions on offering insurance and investment products could limit PSBs\u2019 ability to generate expected revenue.\n\nTo extrapolate the revenue MTN Nigeria is likely to generate from its mobile money business in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, BusinessDay proceeded to analyze the data by Tellimer, a global technology, information, and data provider, that surveyed mobile money penetration (defined as mobile money users as a percentage of total subscriber base) across various African telcos and markets.\n\nAs expected, Safaricom had the highest penetration (71percent), given its dominance and the positive trend for mobile money in Kenya. Airtel Africa had the lowest in Tellimer\u2019s sample, at 20percent, while MTN Group had a penetration of 24 percent overall; however, the rate is much higher in Ghana, at 42 percent, due to MTN Ghana\u2019s first-mover advantage.\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria, Airtel PSBs to create 1m direct jobs\n\nWith an assumption that MTN Nigeria will potentially have 30 percent mobile money customer base from its c68.5 million total customers and its network effect of the already existing group of c560,000 agents, analysis of Tellimer\u2019s data shows, the telco giant revenue of cNGN131bn and NGN53bn EBITDA at an assumed EBITDA margin of 40 percent per annum. This is lower than Safaricom M-Pesa\u2019s incremental EBITDA of 47 percent.\n\nA lower margin was projected for MTN Nigeria due to the tougher competition in the country\u2019s financial services industry as the largest economy in Africa is already home to several payments-focused unicorns: Interswitch, Flutterwave, Opay and, most recently, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe projection was done using Tellimer\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) which ranges between $2.2 and $1.3. The data provider said it assumed ARPU of $1.3 for MTN Nigeria, below the group\u2019s average for H1 21 due to the competition in the market.\n\nThere is a high level of competition in the Nigerian payments sector, with banks developing agency banking and an array of fintechs servicing a wide range of clients, Ayobami Omole, Telecoms analyst at Tellimer said.\n\n\u201cThis means that it will be very difficult for MTN Nigeria to replicate M-Pesa\u2019s success in Kenya or that of its fellow MTN Group subsidiary in Ghana,\u201d Omole said.\n\nIn trying to win over market share, the Lagos-based analyst said there will be tough price competition which will limit potential revenue. \u201cAlthough, I must say that it is too early to conclude with certainty that the telcos won\u2019t make as much money given the higher population we have in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhen MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa get the PSB licence in the next six months, the number of financial services providers under the new permit would increase to five. The central bank had in 2019 granted approvals to Hope PSB, Money Master PSB and 9PSB.\n\nEven though the PSBs are expected by the CBN guidelines to operate mostly in the rural areas and unbanked locations, targeting financially excluded persons, with not less than 25 percent financial service touchpoints in such rural areas, the operators\u2019 participation in the industry is expected to bring huge competition to the existing traditional banks.\n\nHaving the largest share of the market, MTN Nigeria is expected to rake in the biggest share of the revenue, even though the projection is not expected to match its success in other existing markets.\n\n\u201cThe mobile money service will be value accretive for MTN Nigeria because it means beyond voice and data, they can leverage on it to generate more revenue,\u201d Yinka Ademuwagun, Yinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance Asset Mgt said.",

          "text": "Foreign investors can\u2019t get enough of Nigerian banks\u2019 Eurobonds but won\u2019t touch their stocks with a ten-foot pole.\n\nFirst, it was Access Bank and now United Bank for Africa (UBA) that has issued Eurobonds that ended up oversubscribed by foreign investors, a sign of strong investor confidence in Nigeria\u2019s top banks. But their stocks don\u2019t reflect the same level of confidence.\n\nUBA on November 11 disclosed that its $300 million Eurobond was oversubscribed 1.7 times as investors staked $520 million for the five-year bond, which was issued at a coupon of 6.75 percent.\n\nA coupon payment on a bond is the annual interest payment that the bondholder receives from the bond\u2019s issue date until it matures.\n\nFor the UBA Eurobond, investors will receive 6.75 percent every year for five years. That is one of the cheapest coupons in emerging and frontier markets, yet another sign of investor confidence in the bank\u2019s financial health.\n\nThe issue attracted interest from global investors across Europe, the US, the Middle East, Asia and Africa, with orders from \u201cquality real money accounts,\u201d the bank said in a statement announcing the successful transaction.\n\nBut it is not just UBA that has investors falling over one another to get a piece of its Eurobond.\n\nThe strong investor appetite for the Eurobonds of Nigerian banks already came to the fore when the country\u2019s biggest bank, Access Bank, issued two $500 million Eurobonds in the space of three weeks.\n\nThe first issue was three times oversubscribed with an order book of $1.6 billion, the largest order book ever for a Nigerian bank Eurobond transaction.\n\nThe five-year Eurobond was sold with a coupon of 6.125 percent, just as cheap as UBA\u2019s.\n\nThe second $500 million Eurobond was two times oversubscribed with total bids of $1 billion, having attracted wide investor interest as well.\n\nRead also: Appetite for Access Bank Eurobond rises with second oversubcription in 2 weeks\n\nThe successful outings of Access and UBA are expected to spur other banks to sell Eurobonds ahead of the implementation of fresh regulatory guidelines (Basel III) that would require them to bolster their liquid assets to manage risks better.\n\nBut while investors are lapping up the Eurobonds of the banks, they are not as attracted to their stocks even though it delivers an even higher return \u201con paper.\u201d\n\nThe NGX banking index, which tracks the performance of stocks of listed banks,\u2019 is down 0.95 percent this year, according to data from the NGX.\n\nUBA\u2019s stock is down 5.78 percent since the start of the year. Guaranty Trust Bank, another one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks, has also seen its share price decline by 15.30 percent in the period under review while Zenith Bank is down 3.23 percent.\n\nAccess Bank\u2019s share price has however gained 10 percent this year but that is not due to foreign investor activity rather it is a rally fuelled by local fund managers.\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Holdings, which makes up the list of Nigeria\u2019s five largest banks, is another exception, with its shares up 60 percent amid an ownership tussle that has led to an aggressive buying of the lender\u2019s shares.\n\nThe lack of interest in banking stocks, once favourites of foreign investors, is due to challenges with accessing foreign exchange, which has made many wary of holding naira assets.\n\nAt the last check, foreign equity investors had some $2 billion trapped in Nigeria as the central bank rations sales of scarce dollars following a slump in inflows of the greenback.\n\nAlthough dollar liquidity has been improving in recent times and is expected to improve even further as banks tap the Eurobond market, foreign investors remain largely on the side-lines.",

          "title": "Lagos streets turn outlets for fast food",
          "text": "In a bid to reach more customers and boost sales, fast food restaurants have turned Lagos streets into retail channels to sell their products in cheaper and smaller packs.\n\nAccording to a BusinessDay survey, restaurants in Lagos, Nigeria commercial hubs, such as Mr. Biggs, Chicken Republic, and Sweet Sensation, pioneers of the Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) industry, have been using the \u2018Sell-on-the-Go\u2019 marketing strategy, by setting up express kiosks since 2019.\n\nThese kiosks \u2013 small, stand-alone booth-like structures placed in areas with high foot traffic \u2013 are used by these QSRs to reach their customers in an informal way. It is a type of direct, low-cost marketing strategy, according to experts.\n\nUchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says many Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) companies are packaging their products into smaller bits to make it easier for hawking, and restaurants are late in the game.\n\n\u201cThe power of Selling-on-the-Go makes you more accessible to the end consumer, it helps you to break down what you are offering in smaller sizes that people can afford.\u201d\n\nThe QSRs give immediate market information on the products people buy more of, in what size, package, and quantity do they want you to sell to them, price testing like what proportion, menu, a right price point that people are willing to pay for, etc., and it also helps in brand visibility, Uzo states.\n\nSimilarly, Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, notes that the QSRs are going retail as much as possible to offer more products and services, saying, \u201cThere is also the need to go beyond the mega outlets because it is expensive and difficult to run. It is cheaper to run small kiosks.\u201d\n\nTwo recessions witnessed in Nigeria in the last five years have led to high inflationary pressures, low purchasing power, and falling consumer income. Apart from the QSRs going into smaller formats, FMCGs now package their products into smaller sachets to target the larger segment of the economy.\n\nSome of the advantages of using kiosks are that it improves customer buying experience, increases customer base, reduces the cost of the business, increases efficiency, etc.\n\n\u201cA lot of consumer food service operators are now trying to explore the format of miniaturization. It is a tread of trying to increase transaction numbers and reduce cost,\u201d Cheng Fuller, a retail expert says.\n\nRead Also: UAC Restaurants increases retail offering to consumers, opens bakery in Lagos\n\nFuller advises that if restaurants want to penetrate neighborhoods and reach more consumers for profitability\u2019s sake, they should try to increase their outlets but only in smaller formats because the larger ones are expensive.\n\nIn other countries like the US, UK, and France, kiosks are well established but they are the self-ordering ones they use. With the help of technology, this type of kiosk allows customers to select and pay for products and services without the need for human interaction.\n\nBut kiosks in Nigeria do not use technology. What consumers do is to walk into them, look at the menu/price list, and place orders.\n\n\u201cOne way to meet customers is to give them the \u2018go-to service\u2019 that meets their needs. So, the more you increase your point of sales, the more sales you make,\u201d Wale Abioye, a manager at Sweet Sensation, says.\n\nHe further notes, \u201cIf you look at the demography of those who are patronizing these small kiosks, they are within the age group of 16- 30 something years. So, all brands have to go that direction.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Association of Fast Food and Confectioners of Nigerian (AFFCON), the Nigerian food industry is estimated to be worth over N1 trillion and is also one of the best-performing industries in the country.\n\nA recent report by Euromonitor International, a London-based market research company, predicts that 2021 might likely see some street stalls/kiosks strive to improve their customer service by offering more attractive outlets in an effort to better compete with limited-service restaurants.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, some restaurant chains are launching their own street stalls/kiosks as they seek new sources of revenue. Mr. Bigg\u2019s is particularly notable in this regard, as its Mr. Bigg\u2019s Express kiosks use a similar bold red and yellow frontage as its limited-service restaurants,\u201d the report states.\n\nAlthough it is an interesting opportunity, Uzo advises that QSRs should not copy each other or else their business could shut down.\n\nFuller also says the restaurants should not copy each other blindly, \u201cThey should do it based on their own unique financial constraints and benefits that would accrue to them.\u201d",

For us, Edo State must be attractive for businesses.\n\n\u201cIt must be attractive to our own people first and they must invest before outsiders and foreign investors will follow.

Human capacity is important with the right attitude and orientation; this made our administration focus and emphasize more on education.\u201d\n\nHailing the World Bank for its continuous support for the government\u2019s programmes and projects, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe World Bank gave us $75 million to strengthen our basic education system and also invested in the initiative to upskill our young people.\n\n\u201cWe invited you here to join our partners to see what we are doing in the area of food production. Our presentation here today shows you the type of reforms that we are taking in the oil palm industry.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration has continued to focus on training and retraining of public and civil servants, noting that the effort has started yielding positive results.\n\nHe further said, \u201cWe will continue to invest in our civil and public servants, supporting them with the capacity to deliver effective service for the development of the State.\n\n\u201cWe would talk with the World Bank; we don\u2019t need money but technical support to strengthen the public and civil service because our people know what to do at every point in time.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director, Development Policy and Partnership in the World Bank, Dr. Mari Elka Pangestu said, \u201cWe are here to help think through the whole agricultural value chain and work to improve it. We will also work with you to improve the lives of the people of the State.\u201d\n\nOther guests at the occasion include the wife of Edo State Governor Mrs. Betsy Obaseki; Speaker, Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), Rt.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nEngineer Ferguson Enabulele, the Chief Accounting Officer of Edo Ministry of Infrastructure, says Governor Obaseki, in fulfilment of his administration\u2019s agenda to address the shortfall in road infrastructure delivery in the state, has approved over new 101road reconstruction and rehabilitation projects.\n\nThe permanent secretary of the ministry speaks with the NIGERIAN OBSERVER in commemoration of the first year of the second term in office of Governor Godwin Obaseki in Benin on the state of road infrastructure, the government\u2019s new road projects, Edo master plan, the state\u2019s intervention in the rehabilitation of federal roads and civil service transformtion agenda among others.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat is your assessment of the Infrastructure development under Governor Godwin Obaseki administration in the past 12 months or from 2016 to date?\n\nWell, government actually is an ongoing process. Before this year\u2019s Alaghodaro, government has been working and after the Alaghodaro government will continue to work. As far as I am concerned, this government is doing so much in the area of Infrastructure development.\n\nInfrastructure happens to be a thematic pillar that umbrellas road development, energy and electricity sector, water resources sector, physical planning and urban development, management of public utility, the tangible and intangible infrastructure of the ICT and a whole lot of others.\n\nIt is very big thematic pillar. So far, in my assessment, this government has done so well. In terms of public buildings, you see what has happened to the government offices. So, there are a lot of testimonies to that fact. The electrification process is also going on, the operation light Edo is on, you can see what is happening to the street lights all around the Ring Road and the access streets. Also, there is a design to restructure the traffic light, which has reached a very high stage.\n\nThen, for my specific area, which is road development, government has done so well. We also need to understand that road development is very critical a sector in any government or economy.\n\nFortunately and also unfortunately, past governments have giving more concern to what we call the highways connecting local governments but the internal network roads have been abandoned for some time but these are the link roads that touch the average persons; they are of daily use by the people. Overtime, past governments had not paid attention to them (internal roads) but this is the first government is paying great attention to the internal link roads.\n\nYou can see that a lot of potholes had sprung up all over the state. In the entire local governments of the state we have had the presence of the Seefor, of Superlink and the presence of the ministry of Infrastructure.\n\nWe also have very significant road projects like the Ekenwan Road, which is dualized up to eight kilometres and the other five kilometres will be single carriage way. It is progressing so well in tandem with programme of work. That project will be completed by September next year and to the glory of God, funding is not a problem for that project. The fund to complete that project has been reserved and that is phase One of Ekenwan Road.\n\nWe also have another signature project which is the Textile Mill Road of which 60% of that project has also been executed. We have the completed Ihevbeya \u2013 Ogba 33km road that spans from Airport Road down to a little after RCC in Sapaele: a very good veritable by-pass which is now in use. We also have the Ugua-Amagba Road that is linking Ugua-Amagba community. That project is 90% completed. It is just remaining a small portion of the boundary between Ugua-Amagba. There are a whole lot of projects.\n\nThe Agbede \u2013 Ewani project in Estako is going on well save for this raining beacause it\u2019s a very mashy terrain. The contractor has to leave the site until the weather becomes favourable. There are a whole lot of road projects such as the Obakhabhaiye Road network which is housing the Edo State bus terminal. There is a whole network of roads that was constructed there under this administration.\n\nSo, government has done well in terms of roads development and the government is not stopping. We know that some of these roads are 50 to 60 year old that could need total replacement but we also know what the times are in the country and inthe world.\n\nOne wonders how His Excellency, Governor Godwin Obaseki is able to manage the resources to spread across this huge thematic pillar. I admire his courage but no doubt that he is a finance expert and he is deploying that experience to actualise some of these laudable achievements.\n\nWe also have our auspicious project to come, which is actually the reconstruction and rehabilitation of more than 101 roads. The list is right before me. The design has been completed, the projects are in the final stage of award because we have to pass through the global e-payment process to get this contract awarded. That is one good thing about this government; we use due process in every thing we do. So, the contract award is being concluded.\n\nAnd I can authoritatively tell you that by next week, you are going to witness impressive deployment of men, materials and machineries to some of these roads. They are more than 101 projects and first on the list is the rehabilitation of the New Lagos Road. We know that part of the road is Federal Government\u2019s project but this government cannot continue to wait for the Federal Government.\n\nWe know the pains our people go through in terms of these odd areas where the Federal Government needed to intervene but it has not. So, the state government has decided to step into these areas like the New Lagos Road. We have the service lanes which belong to the state but we also have the expressways which belong the Federal Government but we see that there are some spots causing some traffic discomfort. So, His Excellency has directed that we step into such areas and rehabilitate them.\n\nWe have Chief Uguangbe Omoragbon Street and we have Edaiken Primary School Road. If you look at the drains of the sitting along the New Lagos Road, one of the major culprits is the Edaiken Road; it washes a lot of debris into the road. So, His Excellency has approved that the road be constructed with side drains and others. There are a whole lot of projects in my list.\n\nAnother audacious project is 18, 19 streets through Ohonre, through Adolo, through Evbuotubu, through Uwelu, through Upper Ekenwan Road. It is going to serve as a major by-pass that will connect traffic within that alignment. So, that is why we talked to the people of Evbotubu, they should be patient and let us have this all important by-pass cutting across Evbotubu to Upper Ekenwan then government will listen to them; to look at their internal roads and others.\n\nTo me, I score the governor, in terms of infrastructure thematic pillar 90%, drilling down to my specific area of roads development, I also score him 90%. He has done so well with very meagre resources of the state, he has been able to allocate them and use them judiciously. Then, we have been able to distribute these projects in such away that every person in the state benefits from the road development sector of the state.\n\nHow much has been budgeted for the major projects?\n\nThey have their specific cost items. The cost of the projects will run into billions of naira. You know, inflation has not helped issues, it has doubled the cost of road intervention but Mr. Governor brought his private sector experience to bear in terms of this costing.\n\nSo, we are able to segregate the components that make up road construction activities to the extent that he able to tell us that those components that are foreign currency dependent should have their own separate rates, then those road components which are native or indigenous should also have their own separate rates unlike in the past that if you want to apply inflation rates,you apply them generally.\n\nThis idea was able to come in and moderate the cost of some of these roads. So, our road projects are still very efficient and it will be one of the most efficient in the country , I can authoritatively state that.\n\nWhat is your take on the implementation of the present administration\u2019s Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda in the area of Infrastructure development?\n\nMaking Edo Great Again is a mantra that ushered in the governor, at least, for his second term. The journey of making Edo great again started in his first term but it became more prominent in his second term bid.\n\nEverything I have reeled out in this interview is to make Edo great again. Constructing efficient roads is part of the journey, if you look at this thematic design here, it depicts the Mini \u2013 GRA housing the Government House, the State CID Road and all other. We are going to turn this into master piece, to include cycling paths, street lights, walk ways and drainage systems. So, this is an example of making Edo great again in our own perspective.\n\nYou can see it is already drawn, all we want to do now is to sink it with the master plan committee because anything you are doing now under this administration has to be in sync with the master plan. There is a masterplan for Edo State that is being designed by a group of consultants and the regional master planner. So, any significant project you want to do must key into that master plan.\n\nMaking Edo Great Again has different aspects. You can\u2019t know it all but one aspect that stands out is the Civil Service Transformation Agenda; a revolution has happened within the civil service but people are actually yet to feel or see it. The civil service has changed, the way we do things have changed.\n\nWe now have a civil service that is poised for performance, a focused and efficient civil service, a performance-driven civil service has been ushered in, it is a dawn of a new era for the state civil service. So, all these are all part of making Edo great again. To me, it\u2019s the best thing that has happened to us in Edo State and time will actually testify to this fact.\n\nCan you give an insight into how much has been channeled into infrastructure development under your watch?\n\nThe budget of the state is public documents, every citizen of the state and beyond has access to that budget and it is usually read out by Mr. Governor. So, anybody that want to have access to figure on what we have spent can do so.\n\nWhat was allocated as my own budget has been utilized judiciously but we can point at the projects. They are all on-going and all that. I am only hoping that the incoming budget could be enhanced because there is so much to be done.\n\nWhat do you wish to add to this interview?\n\nI want to wish Mr. Governor well and I want to pray God to continue to give him strength. He is a gift to this state; he is a gift to this state, and a whole lot of others. I am so happy that he came as governor, he has revolutionalized governance in such a unique way that I know that people will be happier for it at the end of the day. I am only telling him not to relent, he is doing it for God and humanity.\n\nI am a Benin person, this is my own land, I know that we stand to benefit from everything Mr. Governor has done. I wish him happy Alaghodaro anniversary, I wish him more to come. That is all I have.\n\n...",

          "title": "National Housing Programme: Nigerians invited to apply as Fashola launches portal for sale of houses",
          "text": "Nigerians can now apply for houses built under the current Federal Government\u2019s National Housing Programme (NHP) in 34 states of the country following the launch, Friday, of the portal by the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, through which interested members of the public could apply for allocation.\n\nThe formal launch of the portal, https://nhp.worksandhousing.gov.ng, which took place at the Conference Room of the ministry in Mabushi, Abuja, throws open the door for Nigerians to apply online to buy the available 5,000 plus housing units, ranging from 1, 2 to 3 bedroom bungalows and blocks of flats.\n\nIn his remarks at the ceremony, which was attended by media executives including the president, Nigeria Guild of Editors, Mustapha Isah, Mr Fashola said the decision by the ministry to sell the available houses online was to bring credibility to the exercise and reduce human intervention as well as give all categories of buyers a level playing field.\n\nThe minister told his audience, \u201cWe converge here just to introduce a portal on which the National Housing Programme pilot will be offered for sale to the public. What that means is that we will not be selling printed forms, the forms are online and this allows for more openness, limits human intervention and any disposition to any underhand practice\u201d.\n\nClarifying that the decision to adopt online sale of forms and limit human intervention was not an indictment of the staff, he added, \u201cIt is just to make the system more accountable and people seeing credibility if they win and if they are not successful they will equally know that the system has at least given them a fair chance\u201d.\n\nMr Fashola, who described the launch of the portal as \u201cthe end game of our economic objective\u201d, explained that the government did not just set out to build houses, adding that the project has served many purposes, the first of which was to test what sort of houses Nigerians would like to live in so as to make policies to guide its agencies and parastatals, as well as other stakeholders, to build what could be acceptable in the markets.\n\n\u201cWe are the policy head of those parastatals like the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and so on. We are saying that the National Housing Programme had not succeeded in the past and some of the houses built then still remain empty. So we conducted a national survey across the zones just to find out what is acceptable,\u201d the minister said.\n\nThe findings, he said, were that while in the Northern part of the country there was preference for bungalow and large expanse of land which encouraged building horizontally, in the Southern part, there seemed to be acceptance for blocks of flats and lack of space which made building vertically necessary.\n\nEmphasising that the current National Housing Programme is a pilot or demonstration scheme meant, among others, to galvanize private sector participation, Mr Fashola explained further, \u201cWe applied for land from the states and we set out to do a demonstration or a pilot programme because we then wanted to validate what we saw and build a pilot scheme\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo as at today we have built 5,000 plus units in different stages of completion. We have done in Phase 1 and we have done in Phase 2 and some have started in Phase 3\u201d, the Minister reiterated adding that the other purpose the scheme has served was to fulfill part of the objectives of the administration\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP).\n\nHe added, \u201cIt was also a way to implement our Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) because as at the time we conceived this programme, the country was in recession\u201d, expressing delight that it has fulfilled that objective because over 1,000 contractors were engaged on the building sites; \u201cbusinesses owned by Nigerians and Nigerian contractors\u201d.\n\nPointing out that no foreign contractor was engaged in the project, Mr Fashola added that it was not only an opportunity for nation building but an opportunity for the contractors to sustain their staff.\n\nIn his goodwill message after the launch, President of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mr Isah, commended the Federal Government for its commitment to housing delivery. He also commended the Minister for the innovations he has brought to bear at the national level, which, according to him, was a replication of his development initiatives as Governor in Lagos State.\n\nAlso in his remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Babangida Hussaini, commended President Buhari and the Minister for their commitment to programmes and projects that promote prosperity for the citizens and grow the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nAside the NGE President, other media personalities present were the Special Assistant, Digital/New Media to President Muhammadu Buhari, Tolu Ogunlesi, the Secretary General of the NGE and Editor, Nation\u2019s Capital, THISDAY Newspaper Group, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, and the Deputy-Editor, BusinessDay Newspaper, Abuja Bureau Office, while from the Ministry, were Directors, Special Advisers and other top officials as well as media correspondents.\n\nBoade Akinola\n\nDirector Press and Public Relations\n\nFriday, November 12th, 2021",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has jerked up the prices of the single-phase and three-phase meters by 30.6 and 32.4 per cents respectively, amidst the scarcity and racketeering, which leaves millions of electricity consumers on estimated billings.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the managing directors of the distribution companies (DisCos) and all Meter Asset Providers, and seen by LEADERSHIP on Friday, NERC said a single phase meter has risen by N13,766 per unit from N44,896.17 to N58,661.69 while a three phase meter will now sell for N109,684.36 which is N26,829 increase from the current N82,855.19.\n\nThe new price regime takes effect from Monday, November 15, 2021, the commission said.\n\nHowever, these costs are not with the 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) which the DisCos will include at the point of sale.\n\nAccordingly at the current 7.5 per cent VAT, a single meter will now have N4,400 as VAT to sell at N63,061.69 while a three phase meter will have additional N8,227 for VAT to sell for N117,911.36.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe N18,166 and N35,227 plus VAT increases in the prices of the meters are coming ahead of the Phase 1 of the federal government\u2019s National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) and the Meter Assets Provider (MAP), another existing metering scheme.\n\nNERC in the letter signed by the Chairman, Engr. Sanusi Garba, said the Commission arrived at the approved unit price by considering the rise in the foreign exchange (forex) and inflation rate since the last review in June 2020.\n\nJustifying the increase, the power regulator said: \u201cPursuant to the provisions of the MAP and NMM Regulation, NERC noted the recent changes in macro-economic parameters and hereby approves an upward review of unit price of meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe price review is subject to change upon the conclusion of the procurement process under phase 1 of the NMMP. This price review is effective from 15th November 2021,\u201d the regulator added.\n\nElectricity consumers faced multiple increases in the prices of meters in June 2020 when NERC hiked the price by about 14 per cent. While the meter price increased due to the new 7.5 per cent VAT, it further increased in July following forex challenges.\n\nAccording to the pricing template in April 2020, a single phase meter sold for N39,991.50 while a three phase meter went for N67,055.85. However, with the pricing template of NERC in June 2020, the single phase meter rose to N44,896.17 while the three phase meter sold for N82,855.19.\n\nAnalysis shows that the single phase meter rose by N449 which is 11 per cent, the three-phase meter rose by N829 (18 per cent).\n\nThe 11 DisCos then included the 7.5 per cent VAT and as at today, a single phase meter goes for N48,263 while three phase is N89,069.",

          "text": "\u2026Initiative can increase GDP by $29bn in 10 yrs \u2013 Buhari \u2026It\u2019ll advance payment boundaries \u2013 Emefiele \u2026CBDC will deepen financial inclusion, boost intra-African trades \u2013 Expert ..Lessens cost of printing the Naira \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026Citizens need massive enlightenment\u2019\n\nThe launch of the e-Naira by President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, last week, has sent the signal that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was set to complete the digitalisation of the economy. In this report, BENJAMIN UMUTEME takes a look at the expectations and concerns of Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning for Nigeria\u2019s digital currency which began in 2017 was eventually launched by President Buhari. China, Bahamas, Cambodia, and a few other countries have already issued their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\n\nFollowing a series of engagements with relevant stakeholders including the banking community, FinTech operators, merchants and a cross-section of Nigerians, the CBN designed the digital currency.\n\n\n\nSeen as a crypto-currency class, the e-Naira is meant to serve both as a medium of exchange and a store of value, offering better payment prospects in financial transactions when compared to cash payment.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling of the digital currency, President Buhari said the e-Naira came in response to the need to improve the present payment system as well as cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments. The president said further that there were Nigeria-specific benefits of the digital currency that cut across different sectors of the economy. He also said the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can increase Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that central banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of private currencies that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline; this trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new digital economy.\n\n\u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of e-Naira on the economy as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nCBN\u2019s explanations\n\nIn his remarks, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said the e-Naira marks a major step forward in the evolution of money in Nigeria as it would advance the boundaries of the payments system in order to make financial transactions easier and seamless for every strata of the society.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, the e-Naira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the e-Naira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The e-Naira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The e-Naira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 Naira to 1 e-Naira.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo de-risk the process, the CBN has given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the e-Naira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and have implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system. Specifically, there will be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking it work\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a bid to make the e-Naira project a success, the apex bank took its time to put in place certain measure, which included the minting of about N500 million e-Naira out of which N200 million e-Naira have been issued to banks.\n\n\n\nAlso, 33 banks have beenintegrated into the e-Naira platform just as over 2,000 customers have been on-boarded. According to Emefiele, over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the e-Naira platform.\n\n\n\nFor many Nigerians, the early signs have been encouraging as over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, customers who download the e-Naira Speed Wallet App will be able to onboard and create their wallet; fund their e-Naira wallet from their bank account; transfer e-Naira from their wallet to another Waller; make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations,\u201d the CBN governor said.\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, experts have hailed the apex bank\u2019s Digital Currency (CBDC), saying transactions \u201cwill now be very fast compared to what the speed of transaction is supposed to be using the regular USSS.\u201d\n\n\n\nReacting to the development in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, the managing director/CEO of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade, said that the CBDC \u201cwill not only deepen the digital economy, but will also boost intra-African trade.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThe digital currency launch is a good initiative from the CBN because it will deepen the digital economy space and encourage intra Africa trade as well as encourage investors\u2019 confidence in our economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira is a digital currency and the major aim is to boost trading activities and increase investor\u2019s confidence in the Nigerian economy. It is expected to trigger increased transactions in the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a political economist and development researcher Adefolarin Olamilekan, described it as \u201ca welcome development,\u201d saying the payment system would never be the same again with the e-Naira. According to him, it is an opportunity for Nigerians to bank with the apex bank.\n\n\n\nAdefolarin noted that with the CBDC, the CBN would significantly reduce the cost of printing money.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAll things being equal, the CBN e-Naira launch is a welcome development. Whether Nigerians are ready for the e-Naira and not doubting its technological efficacy is a question many contemplate on. The Central Bank of Nigeria has acknowledged that the liability of the e-Naira is directly on it, which is similar to the cash we hold. The liability of the cash we hold today rests with the CBN. So, it gives Nigerians the opportunity to bank with CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira would reduce the cost of printing new naira notes. As the minting of e-Naira is electronic and charges of transferring funds would be lower for those using the e-naira. Interestingly, e-Naira is going to be a \u2018game-changer\u2019 that would provide an alternative payment system and would radically transform the payment landscape.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the years, concerns around unwieldy portability, the acrimony associated with shortage of change for small transactions, the inflationary push associated with product pricing, the rapid deterioration of both paper and polymer notes. These are genuine fears; however, far from the above reasons, the worries about fiat Naira\u2019s purchasing power being affected by double-digit annual inflation rates, are equally significant challenges to the current Naira profile.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his take, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun state, Sheriffdeen Tella, said the e-Naira is a worthy innovation by the CBN. He, however, hoped that the banks would keep the charges low so as not to frustrate the project.\n\n\n\n\u201ce-Naira is a worthy innovation by the CBN, though some other countries are already into it. It is expected to strengthen the cashless policy. It is an extension or addition to normal fund transfer except that it can be used easily for cross border transactions. It also requires an app which may not be available for those phones used by the poor people,\u201d Tella said.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns\n\n\n\n\n\nLike in every new project, Nigerians have continued to express concerns about the working of the CBDC and its ability to weather the storm. Some experts fear that Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) may be impacted by the introduction of the digital currency.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, the implementation of the process would determine its effects on DMBs. Economists have said also the e-Naira, when rolled out, will have far-reaching implications for the future of the banking sector in the country.\n\n\n\nFor a professor of finance and capital market, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, said it is an obvious fact that the launch would have effects on the future of the banking sector.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cExpectedly, being among first-time movers of a technologically-complex project such as a central bank digital currency, it is bound to create winners and losers and produce unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cThe cheering news, however, is that the CBN appears to have devoted considerable time and resources to prevent undesirable outcomes especially in relation to the health of the Nigerian banking sector.\n\n\u201cIn any case, that the CBN is testing e-Naira through pilot projects is a demonstration of a cautious approach. All said, the launch of the CBN\u2019s digital currency is an important milestone which holds a lot of promise for the financial system in Nigeria and the banking sector in particular.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, Gbolade believes that rather than being competitive, the CBDC will complement the structure DMBs have on ground.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira is not competing with DMBs and it is a new initiative that will increase financial Inclusion in the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nPaul Alaje, an economist, speaking on ChannelsTV\u2019s Breakfast Show \u2018Sunrise Daily,\u2019 said the CBDC would add to the payment system as it would be relatively easier and cheaper to send money from one account to the other.\n\n\n\nAccording to Alaje, it\u2019s convenient and good, especially on the short-run.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the next three to five years, we will be saving one third of what we spend to print money. It would help the CBN to know how much money is in circulation-talking about money supply and how to control inflation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flipside\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flipside, some experts opine that the issue of distrust is going to be a challenge. For the director, Centre for Economic Policy Analysis and Research (CEPAR), Prof. Ndubuisi Nwokoma, the e-Naira would be faced with a lot of distrust as implementation progresses.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe launch of the e-Naira is a new path being taken by the CBN to follow in the global practice of enhancing the payment system through the use of digital currency. It is novel, even in advanced societies hiccups may be encountered as implementation progresses. Even currently, many global companies have not fully embraced the use of crypto-currencies in payments,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Alaje stated that the value of the Naira would not change overnight even with the e-Naira.\n\nHe said, \u201cI really doubt if this will help change the value of our currency. If we look at the way Naira has been in the last 20 years, and we keep the e-Naira that way I doubt if it will achieve much.\u201d\n\nThe e-Naira has the same value with the fiat Naira, but the only factor that can cause increase in the value of Naira is when there is increased FDI and investors confidence in the economy that would lead to more inflow of US dollars into the economy then the pressure on the Naira against other currencies will reduce and cause an increase in the value of Naira,\u201d Idakolo said.\n\n\n\nAdefolarin further said further that, \u201cUndeniably, the e-Naira cannot enhance the value of fiat Naira. Respectfully, going by its function, it is to ease online payment. So, e-Naira is not going to be a saving grace to the current poor performance of the fiat Naira.\u201d\n\nEnlightenments\n\nTo make use of the e-Naira efficiently, many have called on the apex bank to embark on massive consumer education in order to get the buy-in of Nigerians.\n\nThey noted that the CBN needs to work with DMBs, MFBs and other PFIs to address challenges that may arise as a result of the use of the digital currency.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is the need for more enlightenment on the modus operandi, even for educated people. One also hopes the banks with not frustrate the project through unholy charges. It\u2019s a worthy financial innovation and problems that might arise can be resolved as soon as they rear their heads,\u201d Tella said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value question\n\n\n\n\n\nAdefolarin told this reporter that the country\u2019s import dependent economy, structural deficit, and a productive sector lacking the integration of primary, secondary and tertiary agrarian and mining sectors continues to pose a drawback to the value of the Naira.\n\nAccording to the development economist, there needs to be a synergy of both the monetary and fiscal authorities as against the current situation where the repositioning of the Naira seems to have been left to the Central Bank alone.\n\n\n\nHe opines that to enhance the value of the Naira, there is a need to diversify the economy to produce more, earn additional export revenue and be competitive against imports.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor us, healthy industrial capacity utilisation and expansion would ensure a realistic and stable Naira exchange rate that will drastically check inflation. \u201cIncontrovertible, we understand the monetary policy ideas behind e-Naira; our task to bring back fiat Naira to a more valuable national currency of pride is more tasking.\u201d",

          "text": "The Police have arrested a commercial driver suspected to be responsible for the death of a Vanguard Journalist, Tordue Salem.\n\nThe suspect, a 29-year-old commercial driver, Itoro Clement was paraded on Friday in Abuja.\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba said Clement was arrested following an investigation carried out by the Force Intelligence Bureau.\n\nRELATED:\n\nJournalists Storm Police HQ, Protest Over Missing Colleague Salem\n\nTordue Salem: We Have Traced His Last Contact, Conversation \u2013 Police\n\nVanguard Reporter, Tordue Salem Found Dead After 29 Days Missing\n\nHe said Clement who was driving a 2004 Model Camry with number plate BWR 243 BK confessed to having hit Tordue at about 10:00 pm on the night of 13th October 2021, around Mabushi area in Abuja but ran away.\n\nWhile speaking to journalists during the parade, Clement Itoro admitted to have knocked off an unknown pedestrian at about 10:00 pm the same day Tordue Salem went missing.\n\nHe however said he did not stop to attend to his victim because he was afraid he could get attacked by armed robbers.\n\nAccording to Clement, the Mabushi area where the accident took place is known for criminal activities, hence he was afraid he could be attacked.\n\n\u201cI thought it was an armed robber that I knocked down until the following day when I saw a smashed phone on my windscreen. The phone was not working again so I threw it away.\n\n\u201cThe place I knocked this person down, is a criminal place everybody knows that place,\u201d he said.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe 29-year-old commercial driver further explained that after driving for some miles, he came across a Police Checkpoint and reported to the officers on duty that he had hit down someone. He said they told him to go to the Wuse Police Station to report himself, but he refused and went straight to Good Friends Garden where he normally parked his car, before proceeding home to his bed.\n\nSalem\u2019s body was found on Thursday, November 11, more than a month after he went missing.\n\nAn indigene of Benue State, Salem covers the House of Representatives and was last seen on October 13, 2021, a situation that led to protest and agitation by Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Abuja.\n\nHow Hit And Run Driver Was Arrested \u2013 Police\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba explained to journalists how Clement Itoro was arrested.\n\nHe said the detectives from the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) began an investigation into the disappearance of Late Tordue which led them to trace his phone found at Good Friends Garden, Mpape in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Mr Frank, \u201cwhen Clement hit Tordue, the victim\u2019s phone, an iPhone fell on the car\u2019s wheel screen. The suspect however disposed of the phone at Good Friends Garden where he usually parked his car. But the phone was picked by some boys working in the garden and some parts of the phone were sold by the boys.\u201d\n\nHe however said the boys also tried using the SIM cards for calls, which made it easy for the police to trace the phone.\n\nThe Police Spokesman said further investigations led to the eventual arrest of Clement.\n\nHe also disclosed that Late Tordue\u2019s corpse was found at about 11:30am on Thursday, 11 November 2021 at the Wuse General Hospital Morgue in Abuja.\n\nHe said during a search on the body a Keystone bank debit card, a Union Bank debit card, an ID Card issued by Vanguard Newspaper, an NUJ ID Card, and a temporary ID Card from the National Assembly Media Corp, all bearing the Late journalist\u2019s name were found.\n\nMore Unanswered Questions?\n\nJournalists who attended the parade however expressed concern about the explanation concerning the incident.\n\nThey asked why the management of Wuse General Hospital (where Tordue\u2019s body was found) did not report the incident for long since documents belonging to Late Tordue were on him.\n\nThey asked if the Police were going to include the hospital management in the prosecution.\n\nIn response, the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba said that the Police will address issues of negligence on the part of the hospital management and even the policemen at the Wuse Checkpoint on the night of the accident after all the facts of the matter have been gathered.\n\nSee more photos from the parade of the suspect below\u2026",

          "text": "A court in military-ruled Myanmar on Friday jailed American journalist Danny Fenster for 11 years, his lawyer and his employer said, despite U.S. calls for his release from what it said was unjust detention.\n\nFenster, 37, the managing editor of online magazine Frontier Myanmar, was found guilty of incitement and violations of immigration and unlawful associations laws, his magazine said, describing the sentences as \u201cthe harshest possible under the law\u201d.\n\nHe is the first Western journalist sentenced to prison in recent years in Myanmar, where a Feb. 1 coup by the military against an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi ended a decade of tentative steps towards democracy and triggered nationwide protests.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no basis to convict Danny of these charges,\u201d said Thomas Kean, editor-in-chief of Frontier Myanmar, one of the country\u2019s top independent news outlets.\n\n\u201cEveryone at Frontier is disappointed and frustrated at this decision. We just want to see Danny released as soon as possible so he can go home to his family.\u201d\n\nFenster was arrested while trying to leave the country in May and has since been held in Yangon\u2019s notorious Insein prison, where hundreds of opponents of the Tatmadaw, as the military is known, were jailed, many beaten and tortured, during decades of dictatorship.\n\nHe was charged with additional, and more serious, offences of sedition and violations of the terrorism act earlier this week, without an explanation by authorities. Those charges are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison each.\n\nPhil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Fenster\u2019s jailing was also intended as warnings to the United States and the media.\n\n\u201cThe junta\u2019s rationale for this outrageous, rights abusing sentence is first to shock and intimidate all remaining Burmese journalists inside Myanmar by punishing a foreign journalist this way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second message is more strategic, focused on sending a message to the U.S. that the Tatmadaw\u2019s generals don\u2019t appreciate being hit with economic sanctions and can bite back with hostage diplomacy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018PLAIN TO SEE\u2019\n\nFenster\u2019s family has repeatedly called for his release, saying they were heartbroken about his detention.\n\nHis trial had not been made public and a spokesman for the junta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States has been pushing for Fenster\u2019s release. The U.S. embassy in Myanmar did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday\u2019s verdict.\n\nThe State Department had earlier said his detention was \u201cprofoundly unjust\u201d and \u201cplain for the world to see\u201d, urging the junta to release him immediately.\n\nThe American is among dozens of journalists who were detained in Myanmar after protests and strikes erupted following the coup, hampering the military\u2019s efforts to consolidate power. Independent media has been accused by the junta of incitement.\n\nMore than 1,200 civilians have been killed in protests and thousands detained since the coup, according to activists cited by the United Nations.\n\nMyanmar authorities overlooked Fenster in a recent amnesty for hundreds of people detained over anti-junta protests, which included some journalists.\n\nDuring nearly half a century of harsh rule by the military, news reporting was tightly controlled by the state but Myanmar\u2019s media blossomed after the a quasi-civilian government introduced tentative reforms from 2011.\n\nSince the February coup, however, the military has rescinded media licenses, curbed the internet and satellite broadcasts and arrested dozens of journalists, in what human rights groups have called an assault on the truth.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report in July that Myanmar\u2019s rulers had effectively criminalised independent journalism.\n\nMing Yu Hah, Amnesty International\u2019s deputy regional director for campaigns, called the sentence a \u201creprehensible outcome\u201d in a deeply flawed case.\n\n\u201cDanny should have never been arrested in the first place and to sentence him to a combined 11 years shows how far Myanmar authorities are willing to go to signal that they do not respect independent media,\u201d she said.\n\nFrontier Myanmar\u2019s publisher, Sonny Swe, who spent eight years in prison during the previous era of military rule, announced Fenster\u2019s imprisonment on Twitter under the message: \u201cA lot of things are going so wrong in this country.\u201d",

          "text": "Japan\u2019s Toshiba Corp outlined plans on Friday to split into three independent companies, seeking to appease activist shareholders calling for a radical overhaul after years of scandal.\n\nThe move echoes a shift by fellow industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE.N) and will see Toshiba spin off core businesses \u2013 its energy and infrastructure divisions will be housed in one company while its device and storage businesses will form the backbone of another.\n\nThe third will manage Toshiba\u2019s stake in flash-memory chip company Kioxia Holdings and other assets.\n\nThe plan \u2013 borne of a five-month strategic review undertaken after a highly damaging corporate governance scandal \u2013 is partly aimed at encouraging activist shareholders to exit, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.\n\nThe overhaul was announced after markets closed in Japan. The company\u2019s Frankfurt-listed shares fell 4% at the open on Friday highlighting investor disappointment with the plan.\n\nA break-up would run counter to calls by some shareholders for Toshiba to be taken private. Its strategic review committee said, however, that option had raised concerns internally about its impact on business and the retention of staff.\n\nPrivate equity firms had also conveyed concerns about completing a deal due to possible conflict with Japan\u2019s national security law and potential opposition from anti-trust regulators, it added.\n\n\u201cAfter much discussion, we reached the conclusion that this strategic reorganisation was the best option,\u201d Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference.\n\nHe added that Toshiba, which hopes to complete the overhaul in two years, would have chosen the option to split regardless of the presence of activist shareholders and that Japan\u2019s powerful trade ministry had not voiced any objections to the plan.\n\nA portfolio manager at an activist fund with shares in Toshiba said the plan was disappointing and unlikely to be voted through at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) the Japanese company plans to hold by next March.\n\n\u201cThe activists have two options now \u2013 you can sell and go away and come back in two years time or you can buy more shares and fight this thing at the EGM. I\u2019m going to go and think about what to do,\u201d said the portfolio manager who declined to be identified.\n\nRETURNS FOR SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAs part of the overhaul, Toshiba aims to return around 100 billion yen ($875 million) to shareholders over the next two financial years.\n\nIt also said it intended to \u201cmonetize\u201d its shares in Kioxia, returning the net proceeds in full to shareholders as soon as practicable. But it did not elaborate on whether that meant it was still keen on an IPO or would be considering other options.\n\nOther assets that will continue to be held by Toshiba include its stake in Toshiba Tec Corp (6588.T), a maker of printing and retail information systems.\n\nSome Toshiba investors are not convinced that a break-up would create value, shareholder sources said ahead of a formal announcement of the plan.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to split if the valuation of a highly competitive business is hindered by other businesses,\u201d said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.\n\n\u201cBut if there isn\u2019t such a business, the break-up just creates three lacklustre midsize companies.\u201d\n\nThe once-storied 146-year old conglomerate has lurched from crisis to crisis since an accounting scandal in 2015. Two years later, it secured a $5.4 billion cash injection from 30-plus overseas investors that helped avoid a delisting but brought in activist shareholders including Elliott Management, Third Point and Farallon.\n\nTension between Toshiba management and overseas shareholders has dominated headlines since then and in June, an explosive shareholder-commissioned investigation concluded that Toshiba colluded with Japan\u2019s trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year\u2019s shareholders meeting.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Toshiba released a separately commissioned report that found executives including its former CEO had behaved unethically but not illegally.\n\nIt concluded that Toshiba was overly dependent on the trade ministry, adding that problems were also caused by its \u201cexcessive cautiousness towards foreign investment funds\u201d and \u201cits lack of willingness to develop a sound relationship with them.\u201d\n\nRecovering from a slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Toshiba reported second-quarter operating profit roughly doubled to 30.4 billion yen.",

          "title": "Nigeria Police Parade 14 Suspects over Invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s Residence",
          "text": "The Nigeria Police on Thursday paraded 14 suspects allegedly involved in the invasion of the Abuja residence of Supreme Court Justice, Mrs. Mary Odili.\n\nTHISDAY disowned one of the suspects, Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, who claimed to be a staff and contributing editor of the newspaper.\n\nSimilarly, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, distanced himself from the leader of the group that conducted the raid, Lawrence Ajodo, who claimed to be a consultant to the AGF.\n\nA group that claimed to be personnel of some security agencies, including the police, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Department of State Services (DSS), among others, had invaded the home of the Odilis on October 29. The invasion drew wide condemnation from individuals and organisation, including the judiciary, Senate, the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Ohaneze Ndigbo, Afenifere, and other socio-cultural groups and civil society organisations.\n\nEFCC Chairman, Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, had denied involvement of the agency in the raid, while the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, in ordering investigation into the incident also denied involvement of the police in the matter.\n\nBut parading the suspects at the Force CID in Abuja, Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the investigation was predicated on a petition submitted by Malami directing the Inspector General of Police to conduct a robust investigation into the matter. Mba said 14 suspects were arrested while seven were at large, even as he said detectives were working round the clock to apprehend others still at large.\n\nHe said the leader of the syndicate, Ajodo, who claimed to be a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), was an impostor.\n\n\u201cHe is an impostor, not one of us or other law enforcement agencies in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nMba said the syndicate obtained a search warrant based on false representation. He said the identity card found on him containing the signature of the AGF was forged.\n\nMba said the invasion was a well-conceived one with actors drawn from different professional backgrounds, notably, law, journalism, and rogue law enforcement. He said one of the suspects, Yusuf Adamu of the Bauchi State Liason Office, had claimed that there was a large deposit of hard currency in the home of the Odilis.\n\nMba said a prayer warrior, Aliyu Umar Ibrahim, who was contacted by an alleged Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) staff had gone to Odili\u2019s house to get soil sample of the place which confirmed the existence of the hard currency in the residence. He said the syndicate contacted a staff of EFCC, Austin, who was at large, and two lawyers, Barristers Igwe and Lawrence, and a journalist, Nkwazema.\n\nNkwazema claimed he was investigating an exclusive story. But Mba said the police doubted him because he did not report the story before it broke and long after it broke, until police invited him.\n\nMba said all the suspects attended all the meetings before the invasion and were all there on the night of the invasion. He said the security men at Odili\u2019s residence should be commended for observing that the search warrant contained No 7 instead of No 9.\n\nAccording to Mba, \u201cThis action saved the nation what would have been an embarrassment. The investigation has been swift, intelligence-led and comprehensive. Any of the suspects currently at large will be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted other security agencies, whose personnel are among those at large.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesman said no staff of the Ministry of Justice was involved in the operation.\n\nBut a man, who claimed to be the whistle-blower, an Islamic prayer warrior and swore to an affidavit that there was looted money in the house, said the information he was given was authentic. He alleged that he was called by the EFCC, after which they all assembled at the Ministry of Justice, where they demanded for the affidavit that he submitted, prompting surveillance on the home of Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cI showed him Justice Odili\u2019s house,\u201d Ibrahim said.\n\nMba declared, \u201cAt the end, all would be charged to court based on their level of involvement.\u201d\n\nHe said the charges might include conspiracy, impersonation, and forgery.\n\nHowever, Ajodo, insisted that he was one of the five consultants appointed by the office of the AGF and that he was mandated to recover stolen funds lodged in 18 accounts.\n\nResponding to questions during their parade, Ajodo said he was neither a personnel of the police nor worked for the AGF, but maintained his position that he was one of the consultants mandated to recover 18 accounts. He said the search was not executed on the night of the invasion because the house number on the warrant was No 7 and not No 9 Imo Crescent, the residence of the Justice, which prompted them to call off the search.\n\n\u201cI was given18 accounts to recover. I am a consultant, one of the five engaged in that office (AGF),\u201d Ajodo insisted.\n\nHowever, the web of denial of involvement by security agencies appears to be punctured by the accounts of the police and the suspects.\n\nFor instance, the police said two soldiers, a police ASP, an immigration officer, and an EFCC staff, who were allegedly involved in the raid, were at large. Those who raided Odili\u2019s residence were also said to be about 50.\n\nThese raise the question how, suddenly, the paraded suspects are only civilians \u2013 lawyer, journalist, native doctor \u2013 or fake policemen or suspects, who forged search warrants for the operation.\n\nTHISDAY Disowns Stanley Nkwazema\n\nMeanwhile, the management of THISDAY Newspapers, in a disclaimer notice signed by the Managing Editor, Mr. Bolaji Adebiyi, stated categorically that Nkwazema was neither a staff nor a Contributing Editor of the organisation.\n\nThe notice dated November 11, read, in part, \u201cThe attention of the management of THISDAY Newspapers has been drawn to the news making the rounds that Mr. Stanley Nkwazema, one of those suspected to have invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili, claimed to be a staff and Contributing Editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cContrary to his claim, Mr. Nkwazema is neither a staff of THISDAY nor a Contributing Editor. He was a Sports Correspondent and resigned more than 15 years ago.\u201d\n\nAdebiyi explained that occasionally, Nkwazema, like hundreds of other readers of the newspaper, sent for publication articles and analyses and were usually obliged. He added that it was a privilege THISDAY gave to some of its ex-staff.\n\nThe notice added, \u201cThat does not in any way make him a staff and contributing editor of THISDAY.\n\n\u201cSince his resignation, THISDAY had at no time contracted Mr. Nkwazema to investigate any story, and we know nothing of his alleged investigation of a story leading to the raid of the residence of Hon. Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe police authorities and the general public should, therefore, note that Mr. Nkwazema, whatever may be his involvement in this matter, was not on any reportorial assignment in any shape or form on behalf of THISDAY.\u201d\n\nMalami Denies Ajodo\n\nIn a related development, Malami denied knowing or engaging Ajodo at any time.\n\nMalami, in a statement, described the confession of Ajodo as that of a \u201cdrowning man scavenging for a dying partner\u201d.\n\nHe added that he could not have stooped so low to engage a quack or fake police officer as consultant.\n\nMalami\u2019s position was contained in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has been drawn to a confession of a suspect during interrogation in the investigation of the recent invasion of the residence of the highly respected Justice of the Supreme Court; Justice Mary Peter Odili.\n\n\u201cWith all the competent, high level professionals and capable human resources available at the disposal of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, it only takes the imagination of the evil minds to assume or think that the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will descend so low to engaging a quack or fake police officer to serve as his consultant.\n\n\u201cThis is a case of a drowning man scavenging for a dying partner.\u201d\n\nThe AGF said he was happy that investigation had commenced to unravel the circumstances and personalities behind the invasion and sponsored campaign of calumny against his person.\n\nHe added that it was his desire and hope that the investigation would also disclose those after him, dragging his personality, his name and his exalted office in dirty politics.\n\nMalami, while describing the development as an orchestrated attempt to stir unnecessary controversy and public apprehension, challenged the suspect to present documents of engagements where he worked as a consultant to the AGF, whether in the past or present.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cConsultant for what? Which activity or assignment? When was he engaged? What were the terms of reference for the alleged consultancy service? When was he engaged? Where was he engaged? Which work has he executed for the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice? For what duration? And for how much?\n\n\u201cWe boldly and unequivocally challenge the fake consultant/police officer to come out with answers or responses to these questions to the general public.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice superintends over and respects the rule of law, and will not do anything to undermine the sanctity of his office and that of the entire judiciary and Justice sector.\u201d\n\nAlex Enumah and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",
