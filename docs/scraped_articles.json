          "text": "Immediate past Senator representing the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani, has advised Nigerians to settle for studying in government-owned universities, rather than face war and racism in their quest for education abroad.\n\nHe stated via his Twitter page that students \u201cdying to study abroad\u201d should instead \u201cstay at home\u201d and cope with incessant strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities.\n\n\u201cThose who are dying to study abroad, stay at home and get into federal or state university. It\u2019s better to hustle with ASUU than war and racism,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSani\u2019s tweet comes amid the reports of Nigerian students stranded in Ukraine which is facing an ongoing war with Russia.\n\nReacting to the tweet, one Twitter user, @YarKafanchan, pointed at the state of insecurity in the Senator\u2019s own state. He wrote, \u201cHave you forgotten the students in Kaduna State who have spent and are still spending months in the dens of armed terrorists?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a country where hundreds of teenage schoolgirls get kidnapped and spend month with their captors and it\u2019s not major news. Nigerians are safer among racists,\u201d @EugenehoCortez tweeted.\n\n@OgSadik stated that, \u201cYou should know a nation has failed its youth if the choice is between staying here and facing war/racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Nigerians are willing to risk war and racism shows how much politicians like you have failed,\u201d @originalBNV wrote.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We had some expectations but as we can see here, they have gone beyond the standards we set for them.\n\n\u201cThen in terms of deliverables, they have also exceeded my expectations. I just want to reassure you that this will be completely finished before we leave office if we can go close to 90% as of today\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cEverything you\u2019re seeing here right now apart from passing through the ring road III and then taking it to the outfall station. I think it\u2019s almost done.\n\n\u201cWe were also a bit concerned about how to take water completely out of the Secretariat, but with what I\u2019m seeing here right now, I think that has been solved.\u201d\n\nHe described the drainage project as more complicated and fund consuming.\n\n\u201cThis is more complicated and more expensive than normal road construction. If you check what we\u2019ve buried under the ground, it goes beyond normal politics to get this done. It takes a heart of love for the people to do this.\u201d\n\nThe Governor thanked members of the communities that construction works have had to pass through, regretting inconveniences they may have encountered and appreciated the contractors for working day and night to take advantage of the dry season to move at the pace they are moving.\n\nSimilarly, at the Ekpene Ukpa Cable Bridge, on the Etinan-Onna road under construction, the governor said the quality of work at the bridge could speak for itself, assuring that the road will divert traffic at East-West road and take through Etinan to Uyo and then to Calabar-Itu, so people can continue their business activities without getting into Eket city.\n\nReiterating the commitment of his administration to ensure a dualized thoroughfare for anyone coming into the state from Ikot Oku Ikono junction up to the Atlantic ocean in Ibeno, the governor said, on good authority, that Julius Berger has just 5km to link Etinan junction, while CCECC is working hard to complete Etinan junction to Eket city, with just a few finishing touches to be done between Eket and Ibeno.\n\n\u201cThough these are federal roads, we can\u2019t continue to allow our people to suffer, so even with our lean resources we do these roads and other infrastructural development projects, hoping that infrastructure will enhance economic activities, which will, in turn, boost the revenue and economic base of the state\u201d, he added.\n\nThe Commissioner, Ministry of Environment and Solid Minerals, Sir Charles Udoh, supervising the IBB Flood Control Project said the project traverses 17 communities and 3 local government areas with 8.4Km main drains and 1.6km concrete tributary drains, intended to address issues of flooding in the adjourning areas of Uyo metropolis.\n\nThe Managing Director of Wizchino Engineering Limited, Mr Jack Zou who received and conducted Governor Emmanuel round the bridge, appreciated the state government for consistent funding of the project despite lean resources and assured that the bridge was constructed with the best engineering standards.",

Zailani Bappa denied the claim, saying that the Governor cannot dictate to the State House of Assembly on its activities.\n\nThe PDP had stated that after extensive review of the impeachment, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau still remains intact as the Deputy Governor of the State.\n\nHowever, this medium authoritatively reports that since the political crisis started between the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition PDP in the State, activities of the PDP have been moving on the lowest ebb, as all the leaders of the party have shifted their base from the State.\n\nAccording to the party\u2019s legal Adviser in the State, Barrister Bashir Abubakar Masama, it was the tension that forced them out of the State.\n\nWith less than one year to the 2023 general elections, the party has not made any arrangement to coordinate its supporters.\n\nReacting swiftly over the impeachment of the deputy Governor, the State legal Adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Barrister Bashir Abubakar Masama had also described the impeachment as illegal.\n\nHe explained that the State House of Assembly has no constitutional power to go on with the impeachment process since the case was still in the court.\n\nHe pointed out that the court had earlier asked everyone to maintain the status quo.\n\nAlso, in a press statement signed by the principal private secretary to the former Deputy Governor, Mr. Aminu Umar, he said since the deputy Governor refused to defect to APC with the Governor last year, the monthly allocation of N30 million naira to his office had been stopped.\n\n\u201cThis is a legal battle that must be won for the cause of justice because we have hope in the judiciary.\n\n\u201cBoth the House of Assembly and the 7 man judicial panel did not give the deputy Governor a fair hearing at all.\n\n\u201cWe were all disappointed by the ugly trend since the House has said that no court could stop the impeachment of the deputy Governor which means the lawmakers had concluded on impeaching him without fair trial,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Poland will refuse to play their forthcoming World Cup play-offs with Russia in March following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe winners of the game, which was due to be played on March 25, would face Sweden or Czech Republic four days later for a place in the finals in Qatar in November.\n\nThe Polish FA has also offered to host all Ukraine home matches while Ukraine are unable to play in their own country. Ukraine are due to play Scotland in their World Cup play-off at Hampden Park on March 24, and the winner will play either Wales or Austria in Cardiff or Vienna on March 28.\n\nA Polish FA spokesman has told Sky Sports News: \u201cNo more words, it\u2019s time to act. Due to the escalation of the aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine, the Polish national team does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia.\n\n\u201cThis is the only right decision. We are in talks with the Swedish and Czech federations to bring forward a common position to FIFA.\u201d\n\nA FIFA spokesperson told Sky Sports News they are monitoring the situation and an update about the game would be communicated in due course.\n\nPoland\u2019s top scorer Robert Lewandowski tweeted: \u201cIt is the right decision! I can\u2019t imagine playing a match with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Russian footballers and fans are not responsible for this, but we can\u2019t pretend that nothing is happening.\u201d\n\nIt comes a day after Thomas Tuchel said he understands criticism directed towards Chelsea in response to the ongoing Russian invasion.\n\nAfter Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine on Tuesday, Labour MP Chris Bryant told the House of Commons Chelsea owner and Russian-Israeli billionaire Roman Abramovich should have his assets seized, questioned whether he should be allowed to operate a football club himself, and quoted a leaked government document suggesting he should not be allowed to be based in the UK.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, Tuchel told reporters the situation in Ukraine, and the potential consequences was \u201cclouding\u201d his squad\u2019s thoughts and defended their desire to focus on football as the conflict escalated.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pretend this is not an issue. The situation for everyone here is horrible. Nobody expected this, it\u2019s pretty unreal. It\u2019s clouding our minds and our excitement towards the final. It brings huge uncertainty, much more to all people in the moment more involved than us. We send our best wishes and regards to them, obviously.\n\n\u2018We cannot fully free ourselves from it\u2019\n\n\u201cStill there are so many uncertainties around the situation of our club, in the UK with scenarios like this, that it makes no sense if I comment on it. We\u2019re aware of it, we haven\u2019t got so much insight or inside information than you might think, and in the very end, I think it\u2019s also the right from the team and staff to be not political, to focus on sports. Not because we are hiding, but the situation is clear, it\u2019s horrible, no doubt about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to take my right not to comment on it until there is a decision made.

The robbers attacked four commercial banks and carted away huge sum of money. Seven persons including two policemen lost their lives while many persons were injured.\n\nThe Speaker and the state\u2019s Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, later yesterday visited Uromi to assess the situation, emphatise with bereaved families and to greet the people who were injured.\n\nOnobun said: \u201cWhat happened at Uromi on Thursday came to us as a rude shock. It is what one can best describe as an invasion. With what we have seen, the pictorial evidence and some videos that have been around on social media, it is quite unfortunate.\n\n\u201cWith what I saw, even though we have not been properly briefed about what actually happened, you could see that the security was overwhelmed. It is quite unfortunate that such an incident could be carried out without any formal intelligence to the various security agencies, because I do not think that such an action was just planned overnight, because you have these criminals numbering over 20, with various vehicles and all sophisticated weapons.\n\n\u201cConsidering the locations of the financial institutions and the area, it is quite porous, because we have a boundary with Delta State, and of course, there are some other routes to some riverine areas, especially Illushi, where there is the River Niger.\u201d\n\nOnobun called on the government at all levels to increase their vigilance, in order to check future occurrence of such dastardly incidents, while calling on security agencies to use the available pictorial evidence and videos to fish out the criminals.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to believe, with what we have in place, the security architecture that is put in a place by Edo state government, we will be able to track the armed robbers and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the local government where the armed robbery happened, Esan Northeast, it is one of the most populous local governments that we have in Edo Central Senatorial District, which has a standard police station and divisional police headquarters. So, we expect that the policemen have all the required equipment. From what we were told, the police station was also attacked. So, this is part of the investigations that the security agencies have to carry out.\n\n\u201cThere are so many questions that are begging for answers, in order to know the people who conspired to see that the attempts to raid the people were successful. We also need to know how the criminals got into Uromi, that the security agencies were unable to pick on them, and they drove freely.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari at exactly 12:27 signed the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 into law.\n\nOur sister publication, Daily Sun, had correctly reported yesterday that President Muhammadu Buhari would about noon on Friday (today) assent to the long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nCredible sources in the presidency, had informed the newspaper that arrangements had been concluded for the president to sign the bill into law on Friday, putting paid to all anxieties expressed by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAll the anxieties will disappear by Friday afternoon. He will be signing the bill around noon of that day. I believe he has taken his time so that the Act can be as unassailable as much as possible,\u201d said the official who preferred not to be named.\n\nThe ceremony, held at the Council Chambers of the State House, was witnessed by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and some members of National Assembly Committee on Independent and Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, tabled the document for signing.\n\nThe President urged the National Assembly to give speedy attention to amendments suggested, especially deleting 84 (12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nHe said the Act holds a lot of promise for improving the election processes in the country, with the introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.\n\nHe said: \u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to Sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\n\u201cThe practical application of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84 (12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari commended the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of,\u201dhe said.\n\nThe President said he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government, after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes, before signing The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 into law.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that the National Assembly forwarded the Electoral Bill for Presidential Assent, via a letter dated 31st January 2022.\n\nThe Senate President, Dr Ahmed Lawan, commended Buhari for signing the bill into law despite his reservations on 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022.\n\nOn Buhari\u2019s request, Lawan said: \u201cYou know this is a legitimate request. And that is why I commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he had a disagreement with the section, especially clause 84 (12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.\n\n\u201cSo we will look at what he is asking, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of essence; INEC is waiting.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker, Gbajabiamila, described the signing as a landmark turning point in the political history after 12 years.\n\nGovernor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State said Buhari has proved critic wrong by signing the bill into law.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of hullabaloo about this over the last few weeks, even bordering on scepticism that it would not be signed. I\u2019m glad that some of us have been proved right, because we told the media that Mr President will sign this piece of legislation as soon as the section that he raised concerns about are removed from the legislation, and they\u2019ve been removed, and he\u2019s lived up to that belief that many of us have. Because he has always said to Nigerians anyway, that one legacy he would like to leave as he departs office is a credible and fair electoral system. And this will go a long way in making that possible.\u201d\n\nNational Chairman, Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Yabagi Sani, said the new electoral act has put paid to electoral violence.",

          "title": "Biafra: My pact with Ojukwu -Uwazuruike",
          "text": "Founder and leader of Biafra Independent Movement/ Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (BIM/MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazuruike says he has not wavered in his commitment to the Biafra cause.\n\nHe spoke on the renewed agitation for the sovereign state of Biafra; his non-violence approach and why it received world acclaim. He also flayed Igbo leaders for not working for the interest of their people in this interview with GEORGE ONYEJIUWA.\n\nYou started this renewed agitation for the Sovereign State of Biafra. Already it is now public knowledge that BIM/MASSOB is a member of the United Nations Unrepresented Peoples Organization. Now, what next?\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nWell, I started MASSOB in 1999 with 25 agenda. Before I started MASSOB, I took into consideration the protocol of the Montevideo Convention of 1933 in mind. Before this time, there was this belief that the United Nations would recognise a people who are fighting for their independence using whatever means.\n\nBut the Montevideo Convention of 1933 spelt out the modalities for a group of people fighting for their independence. So, what I did is to come up with a 25 agenda of action towards the realisation of an independent Biafra. The first thing I did was to produce the Bill of Rights which I sent to the United Nations in the early part of 2000. I remembered that it was even one of our great sons, Emeka Obasi of Hallmark, who helped me with the correct addresses of the offices of the United Nations. However, I did not make the 25 agenda of action public because I knew that our people are hijackers and that they would steal the programmes. So, I was just taking them one after the other. One of the reasons is that at a certain stage in the struggle, we would have political parties for participation in elections in Nigeria because we took into consideration that referendum is not part of the 1999 constitution as amended and such provisions has to be inserted into the constitution before you start talking about referendum in Nigeria. And this has to be done by our own platform, our people and supporters. That was even why, at a later stage with the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, we even had to float the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), so that the APGA government in the South East could push for such agenda.\n\nBut the politicians who came into the party did not understand our motives but rather started carving their own agenda of becoming the president of Nigeria. Today, you can see where APGA is. Instead of a party that is supposed to be present in all the South East states, it is only now in Anambra State and being managed by a small group of people who are using APGA as their source of livelihood.\n\nSo, the question of what obtains today. I was taking these things virtually in consideration of the modalities of the Montevideo Convention of 1933. Today, we have a mini-constitution in BIM/MASSOB, which I drafted while being detained at Keffi Prisons. And after my release, it was ratified, which we are using today. It is also on that platform that we have our yearly elections through which our executives emerge. We have our parliament. These are the things that Montevideo Convention enumerated. You must have a constitution, executives, parliament and defined territory. You must have the population and you must have a mini-government and these are the requirements. And we are practising these things. That was even the main reasons that I established Radio Biafra London to educate our members and people that this is what we need to do to have an independent Biafra, and before you could be recognised by the United Nations. And that was even why the United Nations Unrepresented Peoples Organisation said that we are the people they are looking for.\n\nEven before we were recognised, some pro-Biafra organisations had applied to be accepted into United Nations Unrepresented Peoples Organisation, but they were not accepted. But BIM/MASSOB was registered by the UNPO as the representative of the People of Biafra because we have been following the protocol of the Montevideo Convention of 1933.\n\nEven before we applied, Rene Bonchi called me and said that we are the people they want and that he knew that we have been in the struggle for a long time and that was why they didn\u2019t register any other Biafra group because they had not followed the Montevideo Convention protocol.\n\nThis Montevideo Convention protocol tries to tailor emerging new states to abhor violence, that is, emerging states can pursue their independence without violence and if you don\u2019t follow that principle of non-violence you will never make sense to them. And that was why the applications of other Biafra Organisations were rejected by the UNPO.\n\nNow, how does the membership of BIM/MASSOB in the UNPO help in the realisation of the independent State of Biafra when the same has no power to grant such?\n\nIt helps because many nations who formed the UNPO are today independent countries. Yes, they help and only few are yet to become independent. They may not grant you independence on their own, but they are attached to the United Nations representing all the unrepresented peoples and nations. While the United Nations is for the independent nations, the UNPO is for the non-independent nations of the world. But UNPO prepares the unrepresented nations and peoples for independence.\n\nSince the UNPO cannot grant independence to any of its members, how has the leadership of BIM/ MASSOB been able to push its case to the United Nations General Assembly?\n\nWe are following the UNPO as a member who will bring up our case before the General Assembly and Security Council. Recently, UNPO is seeking to be admitted as a permanent member in the Security Council. Now, as BIM/ MASSOB, we cannot approach the Security Council but as a member of the UNPO, the UNPO will bring up our problem before the UN Security Council. The last time the UN had a meeting with selected members of UNPO, BIM/MASSOB was among them. It was the UNPO that sent the list of recognised members to the UN that participated in that meeting which was through zoom.\n\nIt has been alleged that you have been bought over by the government and given some largesse. How do you react to this?\n\nI don\u2019t even need to react because our people are fond of that. None of them asked me to start agitating for Biafra in the first place. I didn\u2019t seek anybody\u2019s permission to start agitating for Biafra in 1999. Since 1999 till date, has any of them contributed one dollar or one naira in the struggle for Biafra? All the time I had been in detention, did they ask whether my family was eating? Did they ask if my children were going to school? Did they send any delegation to visit me while in detention? Have they ever asked, how does this man eat that has brought out his time to fight for Ndigbo? I\u2019m a lawyer and not a jobless man. I left my legal practice and started the agitation. I am 33 years now at the Bar, but I left it to fight for them. What they see is that Uwazuruike has been settled, Uwazuruike is no longer talking. What have they been doing? They are the ones setting me backwards. They are the ones sabotaging me, hijacking my platforms. Do you understand? They are the ones who would come to say Uwazuruike has been settled, that Uwazuruike has collected money. Collected money from who? Ask them who gave me this money? From which account was the money paid from to me? I don\u2019t believe in any government giving me money and I am not a lazy man who waits for people to give him. Even though I am no longer practising but I still have to do something to make money to take care of my family. I am not a beggar. The most important thing is that I have set the struggle for the actualization of the independent state of Biafra in motion. Whether some people are doing it the right way or not, today the issue being discussed all over the world is Biafra independence.\n\nEven if I start a party today, they will be the ones to sabotage it. The late Dim Ojukwu and I tried to promote APGA but the same persons accusing me of being settled hijacked and sabotaged the party, and today they are using APGA as kalokalo and said that they have sacked everybody. If I start another party or take over one of these mushroom parties, they will hijack it. The same people will come and say that they have expelled me from the party and hijack it. This is the way they hijacked my radio in London, hijacked APGA and even the Peoples Democratic Congress which we formed before APGA by Chekwas, Ojukwu and I. Don\u2019t mind these people. I don\u2019t even listen to them because they are saboteurs.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHow do you think the issue of Igbo marginalisation should be best addressed?\n\nWho is marginalising who? Ndigbo are the ones marginalising themselves. If you want to be marginalised, you will be marginalised. But if you don\u2019t to be marginalised, nobody will marginalise you.\n\nHow?\n\nSimple; they lack unity. Ndigbo hate themselves and they behave as if they don\u2019t understand anything; even politics itself. They are talking of President of Nigeria. For where? How would they get it? It\u2019s impossible as of today. How can you be talking of Ndigbo producing the president in 2023 when the South East governors are bifurcated in three parties? Two governors in PDP, two governors in APC and one in APGA? Which party will give you their platform to run with two governors in APC and PDP? There are only two parties in Nigeria today: the PDP and the APC that can contest for the presidency in the real sense. Which one of them can Ndigbo say that they are in control of its decision making? Which party can come to Igbo land and say they want to pick the candidate with two states? They don\u2019t know anything. I have told Ndigbo that if they want to be President of Nigeria, all the governors must be in one party and if they see that you\u2019re all in one party, they will begin to take you serious, that senses have come back. They should forget about 2023 because it is already gone and focus on 2027.\n\nBut the South East has been agitating that the presidential slots of the two major parties should be zoned to the South East\u2026\n\nNever. They will rather zone it to South-South or South-West. If you come to South-South, they have six states. And of these six states, only the Cross River State governor is in APC, and he recently joined. The South West has six states, and only Oyo state is PDP. The rest five are APC. You cannot compare it with South East. It is not possible for APC or PDP to zone their presidential ticket to the South East. They will never.\n\nAre you saying that the cause of the marginalisation of Ndigbo is their lack of unity?\n\nYes of course, because they hate themselves. Now, take for instance all those people talking of President of Nigeria from Igbo extraction, how many have visited me as the Ijele Ndigbo, to tell me, even though they know that I have a platform of millions of followers? Rather, it is people from the North who have come here to seek my support for their ambition because they recognise me. But because we hate ourselves, my own people cannot come here because of hatred. They would rather go to the Yoruba and Hausa. It is not their fault because it is in their genes. With disunity, hatred and bigotry, how can we achieve anything?\n\nMy own position on the 2023 presidency is that it should be given to the youths. I have been saying it, let the youths take over the governance of this country, even if it is for four years. Both Bill Clinton and Obama all became the presidents of America in their 40s. The president of France, Macron is less than 50 years and these countries are super powers. I want this 2023 election to be ceded to the youths. We have youthful governors, senators, House of Reps members who are doing very well. In fact, my candidate for the 2023 Presidential election is the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. The young man came here all the way from Kogi State to seek my support. I think he will do well. He is about 46 years and serving his second term as governor. So, we should cede this 2023 elections to the younger generation. I would like a situation where the sons of Atiku Abubakar and Muhammadu Buhari will be coming out to contest for governors or the president. That has always been my view.\n\nNdigbo have been lamenting that the sit-at-home order every Monday is affecting the economy of the South East. Even though the IPOB has washed its hands from the matter. What do you think is happening?\n\nI am not a member of IPOB. I am not in control and so I can\u2019t decide for them. I first ordered the sit-at-home in 2004 and it was successful and we didn\u2019t force anybody because we were working according to the Montevideo Convention protocol. In the 2004 sit-at-home, no force or intimidation or violence was used to compel people to obey. And if it was found out that either force or violence were applied in that sit-at-home, you have flouted the Montevideo Protocol because the whole world is watching. If it is discovered that people were killed, houses burnt in the sit-at-home, then the use of force and violence has made nonsense of what you have achieved.\n\nHave you made any submission to the National Assembly on the issue of inserting the provision of referendum into the constitution, so as to give Nigerians the opportunity to vote for or against major political/economic policies as it is done in Western democracies?\n\nI know what you\u2019re saying. I have done enough for our people. I brought the issue of Biafra for the elite to use to negotiate. Do you understand it? Obasanjo became the President of Nigeria from the platform of the OPC. Abiola was denied becoming president of Nigeria, but when OPC started rioting, Obasanjo was made president to pacify the South West. The South South used MEND to make Jonathan president after the death of Umaru Yar\u2019 Adua when they starting blowing up the oil pipelines in the Niger-Delta and Nigeria used Goodluck Jonathan to appease MEND. I brought the issue of Biafra but Ndigbo couldn\u2019t use it. That is what I am telling you that they lack knowledge, yet they claim to know. But Ndigbo could not do that because of their hatred for Uwazuruike. But if they had used the issue of Biafra as a pressure group, Ndigbo wouldn\u2019t have been going cap in hand begging for the presidency of Nigeria. It would have been the other way round. But because of their hatred for Uwazuruike, they couldn\u2019t use it. That is why I said earlier that Ndigbo are the ones marginalising themselves. They cannot use what they have to get what they want because they hate Uwazuruike and they are afraid to be associated with Biafra.\n\nBut if they had used the instrumentality that I had provided for them, the situation would have been different. But since they have refused to use the platform, I had already provided for them, they will continue to beg to rule Nigeria till thy kingdom come, and they will never get it. It is the same people who are shouting Igbo marginalisation that sabotaged and hijacked APGA. Do you know what Dim Ojukwu, Chekwas and I suffered to form the party? And this same people frustrated everything. Look at Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Every year, the governors will come together and bring one stooge whether retired civil servant or politician who is a 90-year-old man who cannot even fend for himself and depend on you. That is the kind of a person they want who they will manipulate and who does what they want without thinking because he solely depends on the governors for his upkeep.\n\nBut they can\u2019t use me because I am not a hungry man, neither do I rely on them for money. And so, of course I cannot be used by any governor to do what I don\u2019t want to do and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t want to relate with me even though they know that I have millions of followers. Ask any of the governors if they have ever given me one kobo or whether I have ever sent anybody to them for money. They don\u2019t like my kind of person who will tell them the truth but a stooge who will depend on them for his sustenance.\n\nThe Ohanaeze president cannot even call a meeting without the approval of the governors. He cannot even mobilise the people. He is just there speaking old grammar that has no meaning to the average Igbo youths on the street.

          "title": "Relief as Buhari Signs Electoral Act, Demands Alteration of Clause Banning Political Appointees",
          "text": "* INEC holds emergency meeting today on implementation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday signed into law the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him by the National Assembly on January 31, 2022, with a call on the legislative arm to amend Section 84 (12) of the Act which bars political office holders from participating in their parties\u2019 primaries.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was jolted into action by the signing and summoned an extraordinary meeting of the Commission for today in Abuja, to discuss how to swiftly implement the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nSpeaking shortly before signing the document at a brief ceremony at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja, witnessed by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; among other top government officials, President Buhari said the amended Electoral Act \u201cholds a lot of promise\u201d for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology, and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.\n\nHe, however, stressed the need to amend section 84 (12), which contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cFrom the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11), among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at conventions or congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election.\u2019\u2019\n\nQuoting section 84(12), \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election,\u201d the President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe practical application of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension, as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84 (12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84 (12) accordingly.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari commended the National Assembly for its commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionise elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly had on January 25, passed the harmonised version of the Bill.\n\nBuhari had withheld his assent to the earlier version of the Bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political players as part of the reasons for his decision.\n\nBut the president gave some conditions to give his assent \u2013 an action that prompted the lawmakers to re-work the Bill.\n\nLawan: We Will Consider Buhari\u2019s Request to Amend Section 84 (12)\n\nThe President of the Senate, Lawan yesterday gave an assurance that the legislative arm will look into President Buhari\u2019s request for the amendment of the clause in the Electoral Act which bars political appointees from participating in their parties\u2019 primaries.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen at the State House, Abuja after the signing of the Electoral Bill into law, Lawan said the National Assembly would be willing to consider President Buhari\u2019s request as soon as a Bill to that effect was brought before them.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why we commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he had a disagreement with the Section, especially clause 84 (12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the Bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.\n\n\u201cSo we will look at what he is asking for, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of essence, INEC is waiting; and because we don\u2019t want to spill over some of these dates, unnecessarily. We will be expecting a communication from Mr. President with respect to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for amendment, but on the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President said with the Electoral Act in place, INEC should hit the ground running and ensure that successful elections are conducted in Osun and Ekiti states this year and the general elections nationwide in 2023.\n\nAtiku, Saraki Hail Signing of New Electoral Law\n\nFormer vice president and the presidential candidate of the PDP in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar has commended the signing of the Electoral Act into law by President Buhari.\n\nIn his verified twitter handle, the former vice president said: \u201cNow that the legal framework for the 2023 elections is in place following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Electoral Bill, INEC needs to roll-out the election guidelines in earnest so that the political parties and Nigerians can fully commence the journey to choose their leaders in 2023.\u201d\n\nOn his part, former President of the Senate, Abubakar Bukola Saraki commended Buhari for finally signing the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill 2022, while also hailing the National Assembly, Civil Society Organisations and other Nigerians who remained persistent in insisting that Nigeria deserves a new law that will guarantee free, fair and peaceful poll in 2023 and beyond.\n\nSaraki, in a statement signed by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Head of Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office, noted that while President Buhari deserves commendation for working with the federal legislature and rising above partisan interest to give the country a new law that could reform the electoral process, the big applause should go to the members of the civil society organisations who for the past one year have kept up the pressure and continuously agitated for the passage of the new Electoral Act.\n\nINEC Holds Emergency Meeting\n\nMeanwhile, INEC will hold a meeting today over the implementation of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIn a statement by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, INEC said the signing of the bill was historic.\n\n\u201cIt contains many progressive provisions that will facilitate the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe nation now has the Electoral Act 2022 which replaces the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the new Act constitutes the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.\u201d\n\nINEC said given the tight timelines contained in the new law, it fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest.\n\n\u201cConsequently, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission is scheduled for Saturday 26th February 2022. Thereafter, a statement will be issued on the way forward,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Offers N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at I&E window for third party use\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday released guidelines for the implementation of the RT200 (Race to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation) Non-oil Export Rebate Scheme with immediate effect.\n\nThe scheme is in furtherance of the apex bank\u2019s effort to reduce exposure to volatile sources of foreign exchange and to earn more stable inflows.\n\nUnder the new framework, the CBN is offering N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the I&E Window to Authorised Dealers and Banks (ADBs) for other third party use and $35 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the I&E Window for own use on eligible transactions only.\n\nThe bank added that payment of incentive shall be made on quarterly basis.\n\nIt said the accounts of exporters that qualify for rebates shall be credited latest one week after the end of the quarter.\n\nThis was contained in the CBN circular titled, Operating Guidelines for RT200 Non-oil Export Rebate Scheme, signed by Director, Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. O.S. Nnaji, and directed to all ADBs and the public.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had earlier this month announced a new programme to stimulate the country\u2019s non-oil exports segment and achieve $200 billion repatriation of proceeds between three and five years.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme, code-named, \u201cRace to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation (RT200 FX Programme)\u201d, which takes immediate effect, consisted of a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports which would help the country attain its goal of $200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports transactions over the next three to five years.\n\nThe rebate scheme is designed to incentivise exporters in the non-oil export sector to encourage repatriation and sale of export proceeds into the FX market.\n\nIt is born out of the need to develop new strategies aimed at earning more stable and sustainable inflows of FX in order to insulate the Nigerian economy from shocks and FX shortages.\n\nThe rebate is further limited to only exporters of finished and semi-finished goods wholly or partly processed or manufactured in Nigeria, except otherwise stated by the CBN, the circular added.\n\nEmefiele had, at the end of the 364th meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja, explained that the new non-oil export initiative would have five key anchors namely value-adding exports facility; Non-oil commodities expansion facility; Non-oil FX rebate scheme; Dedicated non-oil export terminal, as well as biannual non-oil export summit.\n\nEssentially, he said the new FX drive was informed by the inadequacy of FX supply and constant pressure on the exchange rate, pointing out that the country\u2019s four major sources of FX inflow, namely proceeds from oil exports, proceeds from non-oil exports, diaspora remittances, and foreign direct/portfolio investments had been constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe that the lessons we have learnt from our policies on remittances can be applied in improving some aspects of FX inflow into the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele further argued that most of the sources of FX inflows were unreliable and perennially prone to exogenous vicissitudes of global economic developments.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor example, we have all been witnesses to the ever-changing fortunes of oil-exporting countries. Even those that have been reputed to manage their oil proceeds well also suffer from major shocks once oil prices plummet.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid these sudden adjustments to our economic life, we need to focus on strategies that can help us earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange. We would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Pull back now, Nigeria tells Russia\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nRussian forces yesterday entered Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, as they continue their push to overrun the whole country and topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government.\n\nThis is coming just 48 hours after the invasion of the country by the Russian army on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlso yesterday during a televised address, Putin urged the Ukrainian military to seize power from Zelenskyy, saying \u201cit will be easier for us to make a deal with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, the federal government met with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria, and called on Russia to pull back its troops from Ukraine.\n\nReports yesterday afternoon indicated that the Russian forces entered the Obolon district in the north of the city, just a few miles from the centre of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian President had said he was the target of the Russian invasion, vowing not to abandon his country.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Russian forces in Kyiv massed around the northern district of Obolon.\n\nVideos online show armoured vehicles rolling down almost empty roads in the district. There are also videos appearing to show fighting between civilians and people in military uniform.\n\nKyiv has also reportedly being attacked from the air, with residents taking shelter in underground railway stations.\n\nCity officials are said to have told citizens in the Obolon district to stay at home to avoid \u201cactive military operations\u201d.\n\nEarlier in a Twitter post, Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defence had appealed to the district\u2019s residents to \u201cinform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails (firebombs) and neutralise the enemy\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Ukrainian forces reportedly pushed the Russian forces back, having blown up the city bridge to stop their advancement.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that Moscow was ready for talks \u201cas soon as the armed forces of Ukraine respond to our call and lay down their arms\u201d.\n\nThe Russian government had also said Putin was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, capital of Belarus, for negotiations with representatives of Ukraine.\n\nThe development comes after the Russian leader held a phone call with President Xi Jinping of China.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman, said Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus, told the Russian leader he would \u201ccreate the conditions\u201d for such a summit.\n\nPeskov said Russia did not intend to occupy Ukraine, saying their aims were clear \u2013\u201cdemilitarisation and de-Nazification\u201d.\n\nPeskov added that the decision to open talks with Ukraine was in response to the request of President Zelenskyy.\n\n\u201cFollowing Zelensky\u2019s proposal to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine, Putin can send representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Ministry and his administration for negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation,\u201d the readout said.\n\nThe readout added that Minsk was chosen as the venue for the proposed talk.\n\nUkraine Arms Residents with Machine Guns\n\nAs pressure to capture Kyiv heightens, the Ukrainian government has armed volunteers at Kyiv with 18,000 machine guns and tasked them to defend the capital city.\n\nAuthorities have called on the population to resist the invading troops by all means.\n\nThe Interior Ministry adviser, Vadym Denysenko, stated that 18,000 machine guns \u201chave been handed out in Kyiv to all volunteers, all those who want to defend our capital with weapons in their arms.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian Interior Ministry had earlier posted a leaflet containing step-by-step instructions of how to make petrol bombs on its social media.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence and the Interior Ministry had sent an appeal to residents of Kyiv to inform the authorities of the movements of the invading troops.\n\nPutin Tells Ukrainian Military to Seize Power\n\nPutin has called on the Ukrainian military to seize power in their country.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during a televised address, Putin told the Ukrainian military it would be \u201ceasier for us to make a deal with you\u201d than with \u201cthis gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis\u201d.\n\nHe accused the Ukrainian leadership of using civilians as \u201chuman shields\u201d.\n\n\u201cI once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis to use your children, wives, and elders as human shields,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTake power into your own hands. It will be easier for us to reach an agreement.\u201d\n\nUN Condemns Arrests of Anti-war Protesters in Russia\n\nThe United Nations yesterday condemned numerous \u201carbitrary arrests\u201d of people in Russia for protesting the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and urged their immediate release.\n\n\u201cArresting individuals for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or a peaceful assembly constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of liberty,\u201d UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.\n\nShe said the agency understood that \u201cmore than 1,800 protesters were reportedly arrested. It is unclear whether some have now been released.\u201d\n\nHer comment came a day after Putin defied Western warnings to unleash a full-scale ground invasion and air assault on Ukraine that quickly claimed dozens of lives and displaced at least 100,000 people.\n\nProtesters turned out in cities around the world, including in Russia.\n\nAn independent monitor said police had detained protesters in 51 cities across Russia, cracking down on dissent after authorities warned citizens against marching.\n\n\u201cWe call on the authorities to ensure the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained for exercising these rights,\u201d Shamdasani said.\n\nUN rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned Thursday that the Russian invasion \u201cclearly violates international law and puts at risk countless civilian lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must immediately be halted,\u201d she said.\n\nBachelet said her office would continue to closely monitor the situation and warned that \u201can information war is also underway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is particularly crucial at this time that we continue to closely monitor and attempt to verify reports of human rights violations, including civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects, including critical infrastructure, and other impact on human rights on the ground,\u201d said Bachelet.\n\nPull Back from Ukraine Now, Nigeria Tells Russia\n\nThe federal government yesterday met with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria, expressing worries over the Russian-Ukraine conflict with a call for peace to resolve the conflict.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, met with the envoys yesterday in Abuja, saying that the Nigerian government called for peace and the use of diplomacy in resolving all differences.\n\nOnyeama said Nigeria does not condone the approach of aggression by Russia, calling on Russia to pull back.\n\n\u201cPeace and diplomacy to be prioritised by both sides.\n\n\u201cWe support every effort being made to stop the aggression and Russian troops to return to Russia,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the closed-door meeting, German Ambassador to Nigeria, Birgitt Ory, who is also chair of the G7 Group, appreciated the African Union on its statement on the situation.\n\nOry, who also commended Nigeria for putting in its weight, said Nigeria is a very important voice that the world needed to hear.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defense across the Alliance, now and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of the NRF, called the force\u2019s activation a \u201chistoric moment\u201d according to a statement.\n\n\u201cThey represent a flexible, combat-credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing their inherent agility,\u201d Wolters said.\n\n\u201cThese deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.\u201d\n\nIn a message released Friday morning, Zelensky thanked NATO for its support but urged the alliance to do more, lamenting the fact that Ukraine was left to fend for itself.",
          "summary": "The NATO Response Force has been activated as a defensive measure in response to Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\nThis is the first time the Response Force will be activated since it was formed in 2002 at the Prague summit.\nAll 30 members of NATO must agree to activate the force, which they had earlier done on Thursday.\nThe NATO Response Force, which consists of about 40,000 troops, is a highly ready and technologically advanced multinational force made up of land, air, maritime and Special Operations Forces components that the alliance can deploy quickly, wherever needed.\nThe activation of the response troops does not mean that any US or NATO troops will go into Ukraine, which is not a member.",

Or maybe they didn\u2019t read the supreme court Judgement,\u201d he told The Nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAondoakaa was appointed attorney-general and minister of justice by late president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua on July 26, 2007.\n\nIn 2010, he was removed in controversial circumstances by Goodluck Jonathan, the acting president at the time.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the emergence of Bassey Obot as the substantive candidate to represent Uyo federal constituency in the primary election conducted by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom in 2006, his name was substituted with that of Bassey Etim even after Obot had been duly presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the PDP candidate.\n\nOn December 12, 2007, in a case with the reference number CA/C/45/2007, the court of appeal in Calabar delivered judgment in favour of Obot, ordering the president of the court of appeal to set up a new tribunal to adjudicate over Obot\u2019s petition in Uyo.\n\nAfter a petition from Etim, Aondoakaa, in his capacity as the AGF, wrote a letter to the president of the court of appeal, advising him not to comply with the decision of the lower court to constitute a new panel of judges to hear the matter.\n\nAgainst the AGF\u2019s advice, the president of the court constituted a new panel and gave judgment on April 18, 2008 that Obot be sworn into the house of representatives as the member representing Uyo federal constituency. In addition to this ruling, the court also dismissed Etim\u2019s appeal with an order that INEC should issue certificate of return to Obot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a twist, the former AGF wrote to Maurice Iwu, chairman of INEC at the time, asking him not to obey the judgment of the court of appeal, which he described as \u201cobvious desecration of the institution of the judiciary.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote to the speaker of the house of representatives recommending that the judgment of the appeal court be disregarded but \u201callow the status quo ante to remain until the last word is heard from the supreme court.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Obot was not issued with the certificate of return by INEC nor sworn into the green chamber. So, Obot sued Aondoakaa in 2009 in his official capacity as AGF and personally as the 2nd respondent.\n\nVERIFYING THE SUPREME COURT RULING\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal high court in Calabar, Cross River state capital, granted Obot\u2019s request restraining the 2nd defendant from further and/or continued occupation of the office of the 1st defendant and/or the discharge of the functions of the said office. The court further restrained Aondoakaa from holding any public office.\n\nBut Aondoakaa\u2019s lawyer, in arguing his case, submitted that the learned trial judge restrained the appellant from holding public office instead of limiting himself to the prayer restraining him from holding office as the attorney-general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopies of a judgement obtained by TheCable, dated December 10, 2021, and delivered by Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, justice of the supreme court, the apex court affirmed the judgement of the federal high court in Calabar that the former AGF \u201cought not to be entrusted with any other public office at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was indeed highly reprehensible for the chief law officer of the federation to counsel disobedience to any judgement at all, talk less of a judgement from which there is no further right of appeal,\u201d the judgement reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am in complete agreement with the learned trial judge, as affirmed by the court below that having regard to the conduct of the appellant while occupying the sacred office of chief law officer of the federation, he ought not to be entrusted with any other public office at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with the court below that the order made, though not specifically asked for, is a consequential order naturally flowing from the resolution of the questions for determination in the 1st respondent\u2019s favour and the grant of his reliefs. As held in Amaechi Vs INEC (supra) the court has a duty to use its powers to do justice in the case where an attempt to subvert the administration of justice has occurred.\u201d\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe supreme court affirmed the judgement that Aondoakaa, the former AGF, be restrained from holding any public office in Nigeria.",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In the past 3 years, the Kenyan parliament has discussed two pieces of health legislation that has sparked online debates. The bills are the Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, also known as the Surrogacy Bill.\n\nAccording to a new report by Mozilla Foundation, Kenyans\u2019 conversations on Twitter on these health bills have been manipulated by disinformation campaigns sponsored by an anti-choice Spanish advocacy group, CitizenGO. The report shows that CitizenGO, a group that has been linked to the Spanish far-right, by exploiting the Twitter Trends algorithm, was able to input itself in these conversations in an attempt to influence debates around health bills.\n\nAccording to briefs seen by the researchers of the report, the messages the campaign used to attack activists contained cartoon caricatures and memes that echo messaging by American and European right-wing groups.\n\nThe Reproductive Healthcare Bill was introduced to the parliament in 2020 and is supposed to outlaw forced sterilisations; make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free and provide rights to reproductive healthcare services to every woman in Kenya, including adolescents. In 2021, the Surrogacy Bill proposed Kenyan politicians should develop standards and regulations around surrogacy\u2014an arrangement where a woman (a surrogate mother) carries a child in her belly on behalf of another woman, who receives the child after birth.\n\nOdanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation based in Nairobi, reviewed content posted between 2019 and 2021 and discovered that CitizenGo, and accounts linked to it, had tweeted 20,811 times and engaged in 11 campaigns\u2014when a large number of accounts tweeting using a predetermined hashtag or keyword. 10 of these problematic campaigns made it to the Trend section.\n\nThe Mozilla report reveals that CitizenGO paid the owner of these accounts or \u201cdisinformation influencers\u201d around $10 to $15 to make tailored tweets that discredited the bills.\n\nThe campaign made multiple false and misleading claims about surrogacy and reproductive health. For example, a tweet in the campaign claimed that children of surrogates display behavioural and emotional issues\u2014a claim the report revealed the African Population Health Research Center (APHRC) had debunked. Those tweets went on to attack journalists, activists and politicians that advocated for reproductive rights or the two reproductive bills.\n\nIn response to this report, Twitter has permanently suspended 240 accounts connected to this disinformation campaign for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.\n\nA booming disinformation industry\n\nLast year, Madung and Brian Obilo, another Mozilla fellow, discovered, through a series of interviews with social media influencers who coordinated disinformation attacks, were responsible for spreading the hashtag #AnarchistJudges. The tweets under this hashtag, which trended countrywide, cast suspicion on the competence and integrity of court officials that were against the Constitutional Amendments Bill of 2021 in Kenya.\n\nLike this campaign, it was also coordinated through WhatsApp and social media influencers were paid between 10$ to 15$ per campaign to tweet predetermined malicious tweets.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation report noted that the campaign had all the patterns of a disinformation campaign: heavy repetition of content under hashtags, newly created accounts tweeting political content, synchronised posting period and false tweets.\n\nHeightening Twitter Trend\u2019s criticism\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trends section helps users identify the most discussed topics on the platform and also help them find popular information or discussion. They vary depending on geographical location and personal interest.\n\nBut the feature has come under fire multiple times over the years for spreading hate and disinformation, and at some point, external critics and Twitter employees suggested eradicating the feature altogether, after it struggled to deal with disinformation around the US presidential election. One of Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up the feature was by adding more context to trending topics.\n\nMadung expressed concerns about the potential influence of these disinformation actors in the upcoming Kenya election: \u201cHealth is a political issue & more so reproductive health. As we mentioned in the report, there\u2019s clear evidence that these groups will be looking to exert their influence on candidates and citizens to ultimately affect the ballot in favour of candidates that agree with them.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that Twitter should assess individual countries and map out how the Trends section can be used to push disinformation; establish collaborations with local researchers, and develop a transparent partnership with fact-checkers and civil societies, all of whom can offer context about the region. Last year, Twitter was forced to disable the Trends feature in Ethiopia as it was increasingly used to push by warring parties to spread hate campaigns. By the way, researchers could not find any tangible impact of this intervention on the subsequent volume of hate speech on the platform.\n\nLast year, a Buzzfeed investigation revealed that Nigerian influencers paid to tweet in a coordinated manner successfully manipulated Twitter Trends in order to sway public opinion and court judgement in favour of Venezuelan politician, Alex Saab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to manipulate (content) in jurisdictions such as ours where the volume of content is not as high as countries such as the US,\u201d Madung tells TechCabal. With African countries increasingly vulnerable to disinformation actors on Twitter, a collaborative effort between Twitter, policymakers, civil societies and media organisations will be crucial to keep online discourse saner and difficult to manipulate.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Meet the 19 year old Nigerian building his own blockchain empire",
          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway.\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited him home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. But I made a deployment error that cost the company $10,000.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "title": "What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few days after announcing its Series D round that sent its valuation over the $3 billion mark, African fintech startup, Flutterwave, at a virtual event, announced additional services to its existing offering. In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues. However, going by some of its appointments in the past year, the startup seems prepared for problems that may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRussian military activity in eastern Ukraine has increased recently, with threats of a larger invasion looming. Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, has unequivocally stated that Ukraine has no historical claim to independence; on Monday, February 21, 2022, he said that modern Ukraine was \u201centirely created by Russia.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, potentially igniting a European war over Russia\u2019s demands for an end to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) eastward expansion.\n\nBut what could have caused the conflict? While tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, had existed for some time, the situation began to spiral out of control in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged US president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to join NATO in January of last year. This infuriated Russia, which began sending troops near its Ukrainian border for \u201ctraining exercises\u201d and increased the number of troops sent in 2021.\n\nSadly, 14,000 people have died in Ukraine since 2014; I\u2019m sure many more will perish if caution is not exercised. Plus, I think this conflict has the potential to spark World War III. Do you think so? Leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) data protection laws have long been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d globally. Nonetheless, because technology has changed our lives in ways no one could have predicted in the last 25 years, the rules must be rewritten.\n\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, one of its most significant achievements in recent years. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, enacted when the Internet was in its infancy.\n\nAnd over the last four years, some progress has been made in protecting personal data since the GDPR was implemented.\n\nLarge technology companies have come under intense scrutiny. Due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing, they have had to backtrack and seek ways to protect user privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Facebook and Google are under increasing pressure to better balance privacy and ad targeting, with their fortunes on the line as users revolt, regulators loom, and Apple seizes the opportunity to improve its image.\n\nPer Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free as of December 2021; that figure is 94% on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut is Apple more secure than Google in terms of privacy?\n\nResearch shows that an iPhone or an Android device constantly sends data to Apple or Google, including your location, phone number, and local network details.\n\nSo, how do Google and Apple strike a balance between privacy concerns and profit motives? In the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo covered and provided more insight into this.\n\nPlease read the article here, The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022, and explosions have been reported in the country\u2019s east.\n\nWhy should you care? The cryptocurrency market has fallen sharply as the war in Ukraine escalated, with missiles continuing to pour down on the country\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and its airport being captured by airborne troops.\n\nThe missile reports have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, causing a selling hysteria that has resulted in a loss of nearly $500 million in liquidations for the entire crypto market as of the time of writing.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, $462.91 million in cryptocurrency has been \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 financially lost \u2013 since two nights ago, Wednesday, February 23, 2022. Also, the crypto market is down more than 10%, as many altcoins have suffered significant losses.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order occurred on Bitfinex, where LINK \u2013 an Ethereum token \u2013 worth $3.21 million was liquidated. During the sell-off, Bitcoin and Ethereum lost $129.95 million and $116.68 million, respectively.\n\nRecall that the flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s stock markets experienced a \u201cbloodbath\u201d at the start of the trading session on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe crash occurred as investors reacted to Western governments\u2019 promised sanctions in response to Putin\u2019s shocking announcement that Russia had launched military action against Ukraine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow Do We Take Care of Our Mental Health at Work?

The School which uses the gamification of learning through AR and VR technologies plans to explore the metaverse and take students on a journey to explore the many possibilities in the virtual world. DevPartners: According to Evans Data Corporation, there are an estimated 26.9 million software developers worldwide; however, according to the international finance corporation (IFC), there are an estimated 83,000 software developers in Nigeria. The data tells a story of the vast talent deficit in Nigeria. DevPartners is solving the tech talent shortage issue in the African tech space by working closely with the School of Ground Truth and other partners in developer communities in upskilling potential tech talent through training, internship, outsourcing, and funding. Communication Arc: This is the company\u2019s digital marketing arm, with a presence in some African countries.

          "text": "Mr. Simon Harry, the Statistician-General of the Federation, has disclosed that processes are ongoing to rebase Nigeria\u2019s consumer price index (CPI), which measures inflation rate by the end of 2022.\n\nHe disclosed this yesterday in Akwanga, Nasarawa State, while briefing journalists on the sidelines of a two-day retreat for the Governing Board and Management of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nAccording to him, the statistical processes were already ongoing for the rebasing of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the size of economic activities in 2023.\n\n\u201cCertainly, there are processes involved for both macro-economic indicators, and without us accomplishing those processes, there is no way that rebasing can be done fully,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor the GDP, which measures the performance of the economy, there are certain statistical activities that will have to be carried out.\u201d\n\nHe said the National Business Sample Census (NBSC), which would determine the structure and dynamics of businesses in Nigeria had been done.\n\nHe added that the process for the National Agricultural Sample Census (NASC), which determines the status of growth of the agricultural sector, one of the major sectors driving the GDP, has begun.\n\nHarry said further: \u201cWe are currently conducting the pilot, the main fieldwork will be commencing in April, and so that is a very important activity.\n\n\u201cThe other important statistical activity that we will be carrying out is the Nigerian Living Standard Survey (NLSS), because we want the base year to be very current and so we do not want to use the 2018-2019 NLSS.\n\n\u201cThis year, we are conducting a fresh NLSS and preparations have already commenced so that by June or July, we shall be going to the field hoping that the result will be out by November of this year.\n\n\u201cSo, until all these activities are completed, one for the CPI, as we need the NLSS for us to be able to form a strong benchmark for rebasing, the same also for the GDP, we are looking at the end of the year for the CPI.\n\n\u201cBut for the GDP, we are looking at principally 2023, to rebase it fully when all these activities would have been fully completed and the results out.\u201d\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that rebasing of GDP entails the replacement of the old base year used for compiling the GDP with a new, more recent base year for computing the constant price estimates.\n\nCertainly, there are processes involved for both macro-economic indicators and without us accomplishing those processes, there is no way that rebasing can be done fully.\n\nOn the retreat, Harry said it was basically to work out modalities for better work efficiency.\n\nHe said the NBS had come up with a four-year Corporate Strategy 2022 to 2025, which aligns with the National Development Plan (NDP).\n\nAccording to him, the strategy is structured into seven priority areas \u2013 institutional and organisational development; infrastructure and human resource management; data production, which is the core mandate of the Bureau; statistical advocacy; information technology; and data dissemination.\n\n\u201cThe belief is that if all these priority areas are well-implemented and meticulously organised, certainly, we will be able to take not just the Bureau but the entire statistical system in Nigeria to a loftier height and that is our target.\u201d\n\nThe President, Nigerian Statistical Association (NSA), Godday Ebuh, said the place of statistics in NDP could not be overemphasised, as effective service delivery is dependent on efficient, effective and reliable statistics.\n\nHe said firstly, statistics is all about organising, gathering and planning for effective decision making.\n\n\u201cNow, if you are talking about national development, the key indices or the key indicators are all about statistics.\n\n\u201cSo what are we planning, what are we going to achieve, so it is garbage in garbage out.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for an effective national development plan of any nation, efficient, reliable and good statistics is needed.\u201d\n\nEbuh also said all hands must be on deck to achieve the NDP set goals and pledged the Association\u2019s support in that regard.\n\nThe Chairman, Governing Board of NBS, Kabiru Nakaura, said in achieving the NDP in the next five years, emphasis must be placed on data and statistical gathering and dissemination, as that was the only way to achieve results.\n\nAccording to him, no nation can develop without accurate data. \u201cOur own responsibility is to supply the data to the government so it determines where it gets the resources, where to spend the resources and do things right.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Commissioner representing Enugu State at the National Population Commission (NPC), Ejike Ezeh, said both agencies were into data generation.\n\nAccording to him, synergy is necessary for both agencies to establish comprehensive data for national development.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsogbo Progressive Union, the umbrella association of indigenes of Osogbo, has been battling with leadership crisis which has made the body moribund for some years now.\n\nInvestigation conducted by newsmen revealed that the crisis has crippled the association to the extent that more than half of its property which the union rely on to finance its activities through rents had been allegedly sold off and proceed allegedly diverted to private purse and some individual pockets.\n\nIt was also gathered that the leadership crisis had resulted in litigations most of which have not been disposed off despite that pleas by some elders of the community to settle out of court.\n\nAt the peak of the crisis, another association known as Osogbo Descendant Progressive Union (ODPU) was formed to replace the original OPU and all its property and secretariat located at Osogbo Town Hall had been taken over by the new body allegedly engineered by the current traditional ruler of the town, Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun Oyetunji Larooye 1.\n\nThe crisis rocking the union, according to investigation, got to the peak in 2015 when the monarch, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun Oyetunji who is the patron of the union, allegedly directed that Ambassador Siyanbola be made automatic head of the new executive of the union for second term in office and it resulted in litigation which lasted for more than six years without any headway.\n\nIn 2018, the monarch dissolved Ambassador Siyanbola led executive and formed Osogbo Descendants Progressive Union (ODPU) and asked the union to hand over to the newly created association which did not enjoy the acceptance and support of the majority of the indigene of the town.\n\nSiyanbola wrote to the leadership of the new body against tampering with property of the union and it lost lots of resources during the period of litigations while many others lost hope and confidence in the affairs of the union.\n\nA reliable source told our reporter that One Afolabi Fatai allegedly wrecked havoc on the property of the union as he claimed to have been appointed a consultant over the union\u2019s property, terrorising tenants and collect certain percentage of the rents paid by tenants claiming same to be his commission.\n\nIn January 2021 some prominent elders intervened which brought relative peace to the union asking the union to settle out of the court. Some selected people that are neutral to form caretaker committee were contacted to run the union for one year after which credible election will take place.\n\nThis was after the court accepted terms of settling out of court on 20th January 2021. The chairman of that caretaker committee was Hon. Justice Kunle Adeigbe while others are Alhaji Gasali Kasmo, Alhaji Akeem Woleola, Mr. Suleiman Bodunrin, Bashir Gbodupe and Barrister Bode Babalola among others.\n\nAt this point, ODPU was still fighting on union\u2019s property and Oba Jimoh Oyetunji was said to visited the Osogbo Town Hall where the secretariat of the union was located along with traditional chiefs, local hunters and traditional town crier going round the premises that henceforth rent to union\u2019s property should be paid to the new union formed by Ataoja, ODPU through Fatai Afolabi.\n\nAfterwards, the home branch body of the union organised an election which produced Alhaji Lamar Makinde as the new President of the union but the former caretaker committee claimed that it had already conducted another election through electoral college with Justice Kunle Adeigbe as Chairman an exercise which other people claimed was not known to them.\n\nKunle Adeigbe later petitioned the police alleging that Makinde led executive burgled into the secretariat of the union and carted away some vital items, the allegation was dismissed by the police after the conduct of investigation which was said to be false.\n\nOba Oyetunji was said to have not been happy with the new association which he formed, ODPU was not given free hands to operate and instructed one Alhaji Ajadi Badmus who is one of the living members of Board of Trustees of OPU to go and change OPU to ODPU.\n\nThe traditional ruler was also said to have directed the new President of the union, Alhaji Kamar Makinde to hand over key to the union\u2019s property to him but Makinde tacitly begged him to allow him to consult the elders that he will do so at appropriate time.\n\nWhen contacted, the President of Home Branch of the union, Alhaji Akeem Woleola confirmed the development and said his wish for the union is an independent OPU which would be detached from so many conflicting interests that have held Osogbo down for a long time.\n\nWoleola stated that he and his team contributed more than enough resources to the union just to ensure a united OPU that is devoid of attracting undue influence such that do not good for Osogbo.\n\nHe cited some federal government projects that skipped Osogbo all because people who are suppose to fight for these projects got themselves engrossed in who become what in OPU just to protect hidden interest they plunk from the instability of the union.\n\nAlso, the current President of the union, Alhaji Kamar Makinde described the development as unfortunate noting that part of the land and property of the union were just sold off to one person stressing that his administration will ensure that all the property are legally recovered.\n\nHowever, efforts to get across to Justice Adeigbe was unsuccessful as calls put across to him were not picked.",

          "text": "Regional groups, political parties, civil society organisations (CSOs) and eminent Nigerians have implored relevant authorities to ensure that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday is strictly adhered to with a view to promoting fairness and credibility in future elections in the country.\n\nAfter weeks of anticipation and outright suspense, the president eventually appended his assented to the electoral bill.\n\nBut Buhari did not sign the bill into an Act without getting a firm commitment from the National Assembly for an immediate review of section 84 (12) of the law which restricts serving political appointees, including ministers, from seeking elective offices.\n\nThe said section of the Act provides that political appointees seeking elective offices must first of all resign their appointments and that they.\n\nIt stipulates: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking at the council chamber of the presidential villa after appending his assent to the bill, President Buhari who said the latest version of the bill was a great improvement from the earlier version which he refused to sign in November 2021 said in line with established tradition, he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government after careful and thorough reviews of the bill and its implications for the democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of the practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly\u201d.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo; Senate President Ahmed Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, chief of staff to the president, and secretary to government of the federation were present to witness the signing of the bill.\n\nAlthough the president admitted that the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 passed by the National Assembly holds a lot of promise for improving the electoral process in the country, with the introduction of new technology and efforts to engender clarity and transparency, he highlighted the need to amend section 84 (12), which he said contravenes the rights of political office holders to vote or be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nThe president noted: \u201cDistinguished Senators and honourable members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potential of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes a fundamental defect, as it conflicts with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the national election\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Buhari commended the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn their part, Senate President Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabimila, commended the president for giving Nigerians a law that will improve the nation\u2019s electoral system.\n\nLawan pledged that the parliament would look into the president\u2019s request on section 84 (12), saying the parliament expects an immediate communication on the proposed amendment.\n\n\u201cYou know, this is a legitimate request. And that is why I commend the president. I will commend him for so many things, but let me also qualify it that even though he disagreed with the section, especially clause 84(12), that talks about public political office holders, he still went ahead to sign the bill into law and that is to show his commitment and desire to have an electoral law that will ensure that we have better outcomes when we do election.\n\n\u201cSo we will look at what is asking for, I hope that they will send the request for the amendment in good time. Because time is of the essence, INEC is waiting. And because we don\u2019t want to spill over some of these dates unnecessarily we will be expecting communication from Mr President to this. And then the National Assembly in both chambers will look into the request for the amendment but.On the whole I think this is a wonderful development for this administration, for Nigeria, for the evolution and development and growth of democracy in Nigeria,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nFor his part, Gbajabimila said the 9th Assembly had delivered major legislations in its three years of existence.\n\n\u201cSo we have over a year left and I believe we will begin to polish off some other pieces of legislation but the major ones, we have dispatched within the interest of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the development, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) said they will continue to demand for electoral transparency, even as theycommended President Buhari, the media, National Assembly and other Nigerians for standing on the right path.\n\nThe executive director of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, said assenting to the electoral bill was a big achievement that should be commended.\n\nRafsanjani who also doubles as the chairman, Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), thanked the National Assembly, Media, CSO and Nigerians for the collective success on having a new amendment to the electoral Act.\n\nHe said that under democracy people cannot be suppressed by the few interests groups, noting that CSOs will continue to demand electoral transparency in order to have good governance in Nigeria.\n\nRafsanjani said that President Buhari has fulfilled his obligations by upholding the values of democracy and assenting the electoral bill.\n\nRafsanjani noted that the protest, which CISLAC was part of, became necessary owing to the fact that the President Buhari-led administration has declined assent to the bill twice.\n\nAccording to the CISLAC helmsman, the electoral act will guarantee INEC\u2019s financial independence, which in turn will ensure the electoral umpire gets early funding on time to prepare for election.\n\nIn the same vein, Mr Rafsanjani appealed to Nigerians to comply with the electoral law.\n\nHe also appealed to Civil Society Organisations and the media not to relent in fighting for social justice as only then would we able to achieve the Nigeria of our dreams.\n\nAlso, reacting to the development, regional bodies, political parties and CSOs urged INEC and other relevant authorities to ensure enforcement of the law.\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said the signing of the bill into law will help to broaden and deepen democracy in Nigeria.\n\nSpokesman of Ohananeze, Alex Ogbonnia, however insisted that it has put INEC on the alert to prepare for a transparent election in 2023.\n\nOgbonnia stated that with the signing, INEC has enough time to plan for the 2023 election, adding that INEC should not fail the people.\n\nAlso, the apex northern sociocultural group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) commended President Buhari for signing the bill into law.\n\nIn the same vein, Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) and the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) applauded the president for taking the bold step in signing the Electoral Act.\n\nACF through its national publicity secretary, Mr Emmanuel Yawe said, \u201cIt is a positive sign. The political temperature was unnecessarily heated up because of the delay in signing the bill. We hope this will go down if the demands of those agitating for the bill to become an Act are met. We also hope that this will lead to a smooth general election next year\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), through its spokesperson Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, \u201cThis is a welcomed development, even though a little bit belated. INEC will roll out a comprehensive timeline. There is so much riding on what exactly is amended and how it will contribute to the quality of elections and the processes in this country.\n\n\u201cIt is full of traps and daily people are putting more traps, we will however wait and see the actual content of the amended bill, because when I see what is amended and how it will contribute to the elections in this country, then one can talk more, I hope they will publicise it and I hope people will get opportunity to make an input and above all it is important we emphasis on the orderly and peaceful political electoral and other election activities.\u201d\n\nAYCF through the national president, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, said \u201cI commend the president to have done what he did, this is what is expected from him as a statesman, it is one thing to sign the electoral bill and it is another thing for Nigerians to do the right thing. Often time people do the wrong thing not because there are no laws but because they don\u2019t put them into practices and that is why sometimes things happen wrongly. Today I am happy he signed the amended Electoral Act, so nobody will hold him responsible for not signing it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the CNG through its spokesperson AbdulAzeez Suleiman said, \u201cWhat is important is that the president has at last signed the bill after it suffered several rejections. It is now for legal experts and other professionals to x-ray and dissect its practical implications.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, like most Nigerians who have called for electoral reforms, we are optimistic that the law will ease electoral processes and promote fairness and credibility in future elections especially that it also provides for the use of electronic voting and electronic transmission of results\u201d.\n\nOn its part, the Pan Yoruba Social political organization, Afenifere, said the signing of the electoral Bill into law by President Buhari without constitutional amendment and restructuring of the country will not yield the desired results.\n\nAfenifere\u2019s acting leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, who stated this said, \u201cI am not impressed, I am not impressed because to go into any election, without restructuring the country is an exercise in futility.\n\n\u2018\u2019Why conducting the election when the constitution under which you operate is against the election and the people, the constitution is fraudulent, we agreed it is fraudulent, why is he trying to change it, we all knew it is a military constitution, they(military) set aside the constitution Nigeria founding fathers gave to us.\n\n\u201cThe military came with their own constitution and inserted in it, all the things our founding fathers have got rid of on credibility, but we should have told the military to return to the barracks with their constitution, but we failed to do that. That is my view, mind you I have few years to spend with you, but I have to leave my word with you.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) said by signing the electoral bill into law, Buhari has advanced Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, president of the forum, Dr Bitrus Pogu, expressed optimism that Nigerians will experience more transparency in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cOf course, the Middle Belt Forum is so grateful to Mr President. By signing the electoral bill, he has advanced our democracy.\n\n\u201cHe has improved on the quality and transparency and the credibility of our elections. However, we should not stop at this point because it is not just voting electronically and transmitting the election results electronically. The number of accredited voters must be transmitted electronically,\u201d Pogu said.\n\n\u201cSo, the transmission should also include the accredited voters so that if the votes are transmitted, it will conform to the accredited people that took part in the process.\n\n\u201cWe thank the president for obliging to the cry of Nigerians by signing this bill into law. So, our position is that it will not just be about transmission of election results electronically, but also transmission of the accredited voters,\u201d Pogu added.\n\nAlso, the umbrella body of political parties in the country, Inter-party Advisory Council (IPAC), described the president\u2019s action as a big achievement for the 2023 general elections.\n\nIPAC said with the signing, Buhari has improved the electoral legal framework for the country.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend yesterday, IPAC chairman, Yabagi Sani, congratulated the president, INEC and Nigerians on the feat.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate the president for doing that. It is a landmark achievement. We now have an electoral bill that we can use for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big achievement. IPAC congratulate the President and Nigerians. We also congratulate INEC because they now have an improved electoral legal framework. So, we are happy,\u201d Sani said\n\nOn the return of the Electoral Act to the National Assembly for more work on section 8, IPAC said it is the prerogative of the president to do that, adding that he must protect the constitution of the country.\n\nOn its part, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) commended President Buhari for signing the electoral bill into law, saying it is a development which provides an improved legal framework in the lead up to 2023 electioneering processes and all coming elections.\n\nA statement by national secretary of the party, Sen John James Akpanudodehe, noted: \u201cThis is a big win for our electioneering processes and our democracy. Since 2015 when the President Buhari-led APC government came into being, our commitment and support for constitutionally-permitted innovations that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria\u2019s electioneering processes and internal democracy, have not been in doubt. The new Electoral Act is another pointer.\n\n\u201cFrom legal backing given to election management bodies to review election results declared under duress, provisions for people with disabilities and special needs, electronic transmission of election results among other key provisions, current and coming generations will fondly remember President Buhari as the courageous leader who institutionalised credible elections and internal democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe note with appreciation the patriotic efforts of the National Assembly, civil societies, development partners and indeed all well-meaning Nigerians whose collective efforts and support has birthed the new Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe task of improving the credibility of our elections is a collective and continuous one. As a party and government, we will continue to champion needed reforms. We hereby call on well-meaning Nigerians to join us to completely stamp out past practices of electoral fraud weaponised by past administrations of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\u201d\n\nBut the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the newly signed Electoral Act is a death knell for the APC) which thrives in manipulations, ballot box snatching, ballot box stuffing and alteration of election results at the collation centers against the expressed will of the people.\n\nIt congratulated Nigerians, particularly Civil Society Organizations for fighting on the side of the PDP in putting pressure on President Buhari to finally assent to the electoral bill.\n\nThe party also saluted the courage of PDP and other opposition members in the National Assembly for standing their ground on the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill which among other things principally provided for the electronic transmission of election results directly from the polling units.\n\nThe national publicity secretary of PDP, Hon Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cThe PDP calls on Nigerians not to rest on their oars but to further strengthen their resolve by rallying themselves to take charge of their polling units and ensure that their votes are transparently counted and transmitted in the 2023 general elections.",

          "text": "Until the airports in Ukraine are opened, Nigerians trapped in the country may not have an easy exit, the federal government has been told by the authorities of Ukraine.\n\nConsequently, the Nigerian government is weighing the option of evacuating the affected citizens by road.\n\nThis was one of the outcomes of the meeting Nigeria had with the two envoys of Russia and Ukraine to Nigeria yesterday.\n\nThe Ambassador of Ukraine Kirdoda Valerii had said that his country\u2019s air space was no longer safe for flying and that the airports had been closed.\n\nNigeria had summoned the Ambassador of Russia Alexei Shebarshin and Valerii following the escalating violence triggered by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, who met with the envoys separately behind closed doors, told reporters that during his parley with the Russian envoy, he expressed the displeasure of the Nigerian government over the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a United Nations (UN) member state, and country with which Nigeria has diplomatic relations.\n\nOnyeama also told Shebarshin that Nigeria wants Russia to revert to the status quo before the military action and to prioritise diplomacy and dialogue.\n\n\u201cThis is really the position of the government. And also, that we have 5,600 Nigerians in Ukraine and we are very concerned about what we are hearing and what we are seeing regarding missiles and bombs about the safety of our Nigerian citizens there, that we would like to be able to evacuate them,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Onyeama, the Russian envoy promised to communicate the concern of the Nigerian government to his home country, adding that Russia considers Nigeria a friendly nation and would do nothing to harm her citizens. The envoy assured the minister that their action is targeted at military installations and not against civilian areas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOnyeama said he also discussed with the Russian envoy about the practicalities of how Nigeria can get her citizens out of Ukraine, those who want to leave the country and what measures they could apply to facilitate to safeguard Nigerians in Ukraine, adding that hopefully, the war won\u2019t last long.\n\nOn the question about the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine, the minister said the issue can only come up when the airports open.\n\nOnyeama said the Russian envoy stated that they would also see some airports as military targets possibly.\n\nThe minister further discussed road travel as an alternative to facilitate the evacuation of Nigerians even though some Nigerians have been able to flee into the neighouring countries such as Poland.\n\nThe Russian envoy, however, told Onyeama that there might be risk involved, while also saying that Russia was mindful of the civilians from foreign countries and promised to take all the necessary measures to ensure their security.\n\n\u201cHe was a lot more sanguine, optimistic that no harm will come to them, but we cannot take any risks,\u201d Onyeama stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the same vein, Onyeama, after his meeting with the Ukrainian envoy, expressed the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the country over the war imposed on the nation and its people that came under heavy bombardment, which has led to dozens of deaths and injuries and destruction of property.\n\nThe minister pointed out that Ukraine is a country that Nigeria has diplomatic relations, a member of the UN and cannot condone the violation of their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nHe also told the Ukrainian envoy that Nigeria has over 5,000 students and citizens in the country and was very concerned about their safety and welfare.\n\n\u201cAnd we certainly want the cooperation of the government of Ukraine to do whatever is possible to ensure their safety and security and to also seek advice as to how the evacuation can be facilitated,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nAccording to the minister, the envoy said the Ukrainian government has given all the residents and civilians, specific instructions about how to stay safe and the measures to take.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Embassy in Ukraine will also act as a coordinating mechanism in reaching out to all Nigerians in Ukraine and ensure that they adhere to the advice and directives.\n\nOn his part, the Ukrainian envoy expressed gratitude to the government and people of Nigeria for their support.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are in a very difficult situation, but we are fighting against the aggression and we believe that we will all win,\u201d the Ukrainian envoy said.\n\nValerii also said Nigerian students in Ukraine were in the same situation as anybody else in his country.\n\n\u201cUkrainian government does not differentiate between people on the basis of their nationality and that is the best effort to protect everybody.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the evacuation of Nigerian students is not possible because it is not safe to fly on the sky of Ukraine. As soon as it is safe to fly on the sky of Ukraine, we will join the Embassy of Nigeria in Ukraine and jointly with the Nigerian government, we will arrange for the evacuation of Nigerian students,\u201d the envoy said.\n\nOn the reports that Nigerians are being conscripted into the Ukrainian army to fight, the envoy noted declared that it was optional.\n\nThe federal government also yesterday raised concerns over the refusal by Poland to allow Nigerians fleeing the conflict in Ukraine into the country even when nationals of other African countries were reportedly being allowed into Poland.\n\nThe minister of foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, raised this issue on behalf of the government when he met with envoys of European Union countries in Abuja yesterday.\n\nOnyeama noted that the government was receiving emergency calls from Nigerians who were going by road, evacuating Ukraine and a lot of them heading to Poland.\n\n\u201cWe have had a number of calls, desperate calls and that there are cases of women and pregnant women and so forth,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nThe minister also said the government was informed that nationals of other African countries were being allowed into Poland and wondered why Nigerians were being denied entry into the country.\n\nAccording to the minister, the Polish Ambassador to Nigeria, Joanna Tarnawska, has however, assured him to immediately check with the capital in order to address the situation.\n\nNigeria is preparing to host the president and first lady of Poland, and it appears to the government as an aberration that a situation that people fleeing a global crisis like what is taking place in Ukraine should be prevented from getting out to safety.\n\n\u201cSo, we hope that also the European Union and others, and if that is indeed the case, will prevail on, not just necessarily Poland, but also any other border country to please share some sympathy and humanness to refugees fleeing this crisis, be they Nigerians or any other nationality,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nTarnawska, in her remarks, however said Poland was taking every necessary step to provide safety for those fleeing Ukraine.\n\nEarlier, the Head of the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Samuela Isopi, who led the delegation, said the meeting justified the importance that the EU attached to the issue of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nIsopi told Onyeama that the European Union was ready to assist Ukraine with help, including financial and humanitarian assistance.",

          "text": "The selection of 5,000 men and officers from the 1.5 million Nigerians who applied for vacancies into the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has not gone down with some prominent Nigerians. Their candidates did not make the final list.\n\nThe recruitment process started in 2019 and lasted till this year when the incumbent minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbsola and the commandant-general of the corps, Dr. Abubakar Ahmed Audi, concluded it.\n\nWhen the final list came out, LEADERSHIP Weekend learnt that some governors, senators and members of the House of Representatives, traditional rulers from some parts of the country and businessmen protested because their candidates were missing on it.\n\nConsequently, they mounted pressure on the minister and CG who allegedly insisted that in view of the precarious security situation, the federal government could afford to compromise on stands in the recruitment of men and officers into the NSCDC.\n\nIt was learnt that by the insistence on merit by the minister and the CG, the affected leaders went to high authorities to \u201cpress buttons\u201d but failed to realise their ambition as the presidency reportedly refused to intervene in the exercise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was learnt that it was against this backdrop that some governors cried out that the names of candidates in their states\u2019 allocations were alien to them.\n\nA credible source in the ministry of interior told LEADERSHIP Weekend; \u201cWe adhered strictly to the rules of fairness, justice and equity in the selection process.\u201d\n\nInvestigations revealed that both the minister and the NSCDC boss who inherited the selection process which began in 2019 ignored the sordid path that the recruitment process had often charted and refused to bow to pressures from influence peddlers in the country but ensured that the selected 5,000 recruits emerged through merit.\n\nThe source in the ministry said a former minister of interior who started the recruitment process, a former commandant-general, past and serving governors, senators and House of Representatives members were the worst hit because their lists enjoyed preferential treatment in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Civil Defence, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board (CDCFIB) opened its recruitment portal on August 9, 2019, where it later disclosed that 1.4 million Nigerians had scrambled for the 5,000 job openings advertised by the NSCDC.\n\nWhen the application portal was opened in 2019, about 1, 477, 042 Nigerians applied for various spots but using a set of criteria, the figure was pruned to 217,000 in March 2020 and 53,116 in December 2020. Sometime in 2022, the figure was again reduced to 6,500 before the final screening which arrived at the targeted 5,000.\n\nA top source at the board told LEADERSHIP Weekend that contrary to claims in some quarters, the process was hijacked by Aregbesola and Audi\u2019s predecessors, political and business heavyweights, who reserved slots for their preferred candidates through backdoor, \u201cWe could not risk the nation\u2019s future, development and progress by presenting less than the best for the job.\u201d\n\nUnder the old order, 10-40 percent of the total slots were reserved for the powers that be and later increased to between 40- 80 percent, a practice that had led to the less competent dominating the corps. However, Aregbesola and Audi stepped on every toe imaginable to achieve the goal of selecting only the most qualified 5,000 candidates.\n\nHowever, some aggrieved staff members of the board have argued that the usual \u201cwho gets what, how and why, the drama that characterised the over two years recruitment process brought to the fore, the wishy-washy manner in which individuals who were not even capable of spelling their names, but were highly favoured got key positions into the various sectors of the polity at the detriment of those who merited them.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted on certain allegations against key actors in the recruitment process, the director of public relations of the corps, DCC Olusola Odumosu, told our correspondent that the selection was purely on merit. He expressed shock at the news that some powerful toes were stepped on as he categorically said that no prominent Nigerian attempted to influence the process.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is that all the classification of persons you listed are well meaning Nigerians who understand that the nation requires its best and brightest to pilot it through the turbulence of nationhood and the challenges of development. I strongly believe and I am aware that all former ministers of interior and CGs of the Civil Defence take this philosophy very seriously and strive often to put their best foot forward. For as much as I know them, favouritism, tribalism and playing the second team just does not suffice. Only the first eleven will do. I mean, the best.\u201d\n\nOdumosu said both the minister and his boss were ardent believers in the logic that the most qualified should get the job. They both do not give room to mediocrity in recruitment. There is ample evidence to show, he said.\n\n\u201cYes, selecting these 5,000 following the rot that had attended the system was no mean task. It was one which came with a lot of danger. It was not a job for the faint-hearted or the lily-livered. It was a job for the brave and lion-hearted. It was a job for the fearless and incorruptible. Aregbesola and Audi fit that bill,\u201d he said.\n\nOdumosu added; \u201cThe Civil Defence Corps understands that a drowsy work-force is not what we need in the country, especially at a time when the nation needs a surgical operation on all fronts to solve the myriad of problems confronting it on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cI can beat my chest to tell you that they both spearheaded institutional reforms through the establishment of due process mechanisms and strategies that became the nightmare of fraudulent persons. As far as this selection is concerned, the two leaders were fearless in the discharge of their duties and shunned attempts to compromise them. Yes, they spoke with authority and acted with finality against favouritism.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman added, \u201cMy boss is one person who firmly believes that Nigerians must go back to the days where merit, professionalism, expertise and willingness to work dominated the workforce which yielded viability and sustainability. He is of the school of thought that argues that leaders must begin the process of placing into leadership positions square pegs in square holes, so that efficiency can take the centre stage in our polity.\u201d\n\nFurther findings by our correspondent showed that those who were secretly offered employment and were gearing up to assume duties prior to Audi\u2019s resumption of office were thrown out.\n\nA source close to the interior ministry in Abuja said the federal government was deeply embarrassed by the controversy surrounding the NSCDC recruitment and would, therefore, not allow what it described as \u201cbackyard\u201d recruitment into the service.\n\nThe source said, \u201cI can say that the government prior to this final list, cancelled the backdoor recruitment exercise that was carried out and took appropriate steps to recruit in a transparent way.\n\nAlready, the Bauchi State House of Assembly has rejected the outcome of the recent recruitment process as it relates to the state, declaring it as a scam.\n\nThe resolution of the House followed the submission of the report of the Joint Committee on Security and Public Service on the exercise by the corps which was laid by Hon. Sabo Bako Sade, representing Sade Constituency.\n\nAccording to the report, the committee discovered that after the screening for the recruitment, the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the state communicated to the Assembly that there was a scam during the exercise in which seven of the 10 applicants whose names appeared on the state\u2019s list were discovered to be non-indigenes as reported by Hon. Jamilu Umaru Dahiru, the member representing Bauchi Central.\n\nThe committee has since recommended that the outcome of the exercise and communicate the same to the national headquarters of the NSCDC.\n\nAlso recently, Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum gave reasons why the nation\u2019s security system is seldom compromised.\n\nHe was quoted to have said, \u201cThese days, the governors, ministers and other top government functionaries have slots; nobody is to interview them whether they are qualified or not. Admission into the Nigerian Army, police and other security agencies are now politicised.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the undue influence of politicians has made it almost impossible for the country to get the required commitment and dedication from those recruited into the security agencies.\n\nHis words, \u201cThe major problem is the recruitment process, those being recruited into Nigerian Army, police, and other security agencies are job seekers, many of them are there because they don\u2019t have a job. Those enlisted 20 years ago are performing well but these people are looking for employment only, so there\u2019s no commitment and dedication.\u201d",

          "title": "Agony Of Borno Student Whose Throat Was Slit For Refusing Errand",
          "text": "Jubril Sadi Mato (Ramadan), an 11-year-old pre-junior student of Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri, woke up in the wee hours of January 15, 2022, had his ablution and observed his prayers with hope of a brighter day ahead.\n\nHe went about the activities of the day, full of life. But by nightfall, when most students had begun to retire to bed, Ramadan as he is fondly called, had his life almost snuffed out by his senior colleague.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that a senior colleague, from SS2 Class had sent Ramadan on an errand, but he refused to go.\n\nThat fateful night, the senior colleague then picked him up and took him to a lonely place and used a razor blade to severely cut his neck, injuring most of his artery nerves and trachea.\n\nHis attacker, who was later identified as Ahmad Umar Goni, left the victim to die with his body soaked in blood.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut after some minutes, Jubril struggled and found his way to the principal\u2019s office, before he finally broke down and became unconscious.\n\nJubril was rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) as he laid critical at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the perpetrator, who was alleged to be indoctrinated on psychotropic substances, was subsequently arrested and handed over to police for further investigations.\n\nA family member of the victim, who spoke with LEADERSHIP Weekend on condition of anonymity, noted that the case of Jubril had effectively been decriminalised as a result of a collapse in prosecutions that has allowed many offenders to escape justice and to go on to reoffend in the knowledge that they are highly unlikely to be held accountable.\n\nHe said for the fact that their acts of violence are normalised, accepted or excused, give a feeling of power and impunity to these individuals and encourages such recurrent shameful predatory behaviour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis support system, the family member of Jubril said, must be annihilated at all cost and in no uncertain terms.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first case of armed violence in the college, there are several other cases relating to sexual abuse and armed violence, but the school management had swept them under the carpet. This is likely to mean we are creating more victims as a result of our failure to act.\n\n\u201cThis can result in far-reaching and catastrophic consequences on the physical and mental state of any child. Because It is, amongst others, responsible for a decrease of academic performance and a high proportion of school dropouts, denying its victims the very right to education,\u201d he said.\n\nHe therefore appealed to Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum, the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Legal Aid Council and other reputable organisations and individuals to seek redress for Ramadan as his condition remained critical at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital.\n\nSome students of the school, who also spoke on the issue, claimed they were told by the management that Jubril attempted to commit suicide because he hated being a boarder.\n\nOne of the students, who craved anonymity, said, \u201cThey told us that he tried to kill himself with a razor blade by cutting himself. But we later learnt that it was one of our seniors who wounded him for refusing his errand.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know his present condition. I hope he is not dead?\u201d he said.\n\nA senior staff of the college, who also craved anonymity, said: \u201cOn the same day, a delegation from the Borno State Ministry of Education visited the college when the director departed to Damaturu, Yobe State, leaving his principals behind; they were told that the principals were not on site.\n\nThe source added that the suspect committed the act under the influence of drugs which were being secretly sold to students by a senior managing officer of the Junior Secondary School Section.\n\nAccording to him, the college management covered numerous cases of misconducts perpetrated by the students and some of the staff members without the knowledge of the parents, even though, the Parent and Teacher Association (PTA) was scrapped for years, following mass protest over increment and change of school uniforms by the management.\n\nIn a swift reaction to media reports on the incident, the principal, Mr Kashim Ibrahim Abdullahi, through a press statement signed and issued on the 22nd February, 2022, said the suspect, Ahmad Umar Goni, an SS2 student for an unknown reason partially cut the throat of one student, Jubril Sadi Mato of pre- junior secondary school.\n\nThe statement added that the matter was immediately reported to the principal of the junior secondary school who rushed the victim to Borno State Specialist Hospital from where they were referred to the trauma centre of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH), where Jubril has been receiving medical attention, adding that staff of the college queued up to donate blood for the victim and the school fully took financial responsibility.\n\nThe principal said according to the provision of the law of the land, the college has no right to treat crime cases of such magnitude and thus handed the culprit over to the police a few hours after the incident for further investigation.\n\nThe principal said:\u201d The management of Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri issued this press statement regarding an incident that took place in the college on Saturday night, 15th January, 2022 at about 10: 05pm, immediately after prep.\n\n\u201cOne student Ahmad Umar Goni of SS2A for an unknown reason partially cut the throat of one student, Jubril Sadi Mato of Pre-JSS.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some media houses, individuals as well as other critics of the college without any proof or verifiable evidence went on spreading false information when the college itself is still waiting for the police to conclude their investigation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the management of the college denounces all these conspiracies and fake news about the incident. For instance, several allegations were made against the college of allegedly conniving with the parents of the culprit and the guardian of the victim to conceal the fact about the incident.\n\n\u201cContrarily, the testimonies of both the parents in their media interactions debunked these allegations which were meant to dent the image of the college. It is also noteworthy to mention that such an incident has never occurred in the 47-year history of the college.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, Jubril is now getting better by Allah\u2019s grace. The management of the college, its entire staff and students sincerely sympathise with the family of the victim and earnestly pray for his full recovery. \u201c\n\nThe ministerial emergency committee for the investigation of attempted homicide at Elkanemi College of Islamic Theology, Maiduguri was upgraded to state committee by the Zulum administration.\n\nThe committee was approved by Borno State Governor Babagana Umara Zulum on 25th January, 2022, to investigate the reported attack on a pre-JSS student, Jibril Sadi Mato, by a senior student on 15th January, 2022.\n\nThe setting up of the committee was contained in a statement signed by the secretary to the state government (SSG), Alhaji Usman Jidda Shuwa.\n\nShuwa stated that the committee was headed by the acting permanent secretary and solicitor-general of the Borno State Ministry of Justice, Abdullahi Husaini Izge, while it has directors of schools, ministry of education, representatives of civil society organisation, chairman of Borno State Parent and Teacher Association (PTA), representatives of Department of State Services (DSS),and the state police command, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) as well as the secretary of Cabinet Affairs, Governor\u2019s Office, among others.\n\nThe statement added that the committee will be inaugurated by the state deputy governor, Umar Usman Kadafur, at his office on Wednesday, 26th January, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, family members of the victim have decried the inability of the committee to make its findings public since over three weeks after the incident.\n\nThe family members through a statement issued by their lawyer wondered why no member of the family was represented in the committee.\n\nA cousin of Jubril Sadi Mato, Aisha Mato, while expressing worry over the continued delay in addressing the cause of the incident to our correspondent, said the victim has remained at home since he was discharged from the hospital and that the injuries which was not properly handled by UMTH is currently developing complications hence they want to take Jubril to an Egyptian hospital for further treatment.\n\nShe regretted that neither the school management nor the state government has reached out to them since their son was discharged from the intensive care unit of UMTH a fortnight ago despite countless efforts to ascertain the true situation that led to their son being cut on the neck.\n\nShe said: \u201cRamadan (Jubril\u2019s pet name) has not overcome the trauma of that incident. Since he was discharged from the hospital, he has refused to return to school or even agree to go to another school despite our efforts to get him enrolled in a new school. He keeps saying he does not want to go to school again because he will be killed.\n\n\u201cAnd lately, the unhealed injury has developed complications with his stomach swollen with constant foaming from his mouth. This is why we want to take him to a hospital in Egypt for proper medical attention.\n\n\u201cWe have been waiting for the state government to tell us the findings of their investigations but up to this moment, they have not said anything to us. The school management too has kept silent. We are at the crossroads at the moment because we don\u2019t even know what is happening.\n\n\u201cIt seems there is a conspiracy to sweep the matter under the carpet but we will not allow that to happen. We actually heard the rumour that the school management attempted to hide the incident from getting to the public space but we did not believe it, but with what is happening now, we tend to give credence to that rumour. But we will pursue this matter to a logical conclusion because we want justice for our son,\u201d the cousin said.\n\nCorroborating Aisha Mato, another cousin of Jubril, Adam Mato, said the victim, who has suddenly developed complications, needs further and urgent treatment in a better hospital.\n\nHe appealed to the state government and the school management to join the family and restore the health of Jubril whom he said is in urgent need of medical attention.\n\n\u201cThe management of the school is not even following up to know the condition of the boy. They have been nonchalant about the issue. It is very sad,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHe claimed that UMTH had not been helpful by refusing them a referral letter that would assist the new hospital to understand the kind of treatment and where it stopped on the boy.\n\nHe said the UMTH management has been dribbling them whenever the request is made by the family.\n\nBut a credible source in UMTH who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there is no way the hospital can give them a referral letter after the boy had been discharged from the hospital.\n\nThe source said unless they bring him back on admission to be discharged with referral, the request won\u2019t be granted.",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019ll usher in robust democracy, NASS \u2026It\u2019s historic \u2013 INEC, holds extraordinary meeting Saturday \u2026Buhari institutionalising credible elections in Nigeria \u2013 APC \u2026Action a death knell for APC \u2013 PDP \u2026Atiku, Saraki, Ekweremadu hails Buhari, NASS \u2026NBA thumbs up president, says it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Friday called on members of the National Assembly to immediately amend some sections of the Electoral Act 2022 that contravene the rights of political office holders to vote and be voted for in political party conventions and congresses.\n\nThe president made the call before assenting to the Electoral Act at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election.\n\nQuoting the Section, the president said, \u201c84(12) No political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election,\u201d the President noted it had introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\n\u201cThe practical application of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under sections 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension, as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it would not be right for the country\u2019s democratic processes to overstretch beyond constitutional limits.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restrictions into the constitution on account of practical application of Section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said the Electoral Act 2022 holds a lot of promise for improving the election processes in the country, with introduction of new technology and efforts to engender clarity and transparency.\n\n\u201cFrom the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11), among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting Section 84(12) accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe president commended members of the National Assembly for their commitment and dedication to improving the previous Electoral Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for a credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe president said he received inputs from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the government, after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes, before signing The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022 into law.\n\nINEC\u2019s declarations\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that it fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with the implementation of the newly signed 2022 Electoral Act in earnest.\n\nTo this end, the Commission has summoned an extraordinary meeting scheduled for today Saturday, February 26, 2022.\n\nA statement issued Friday by the National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education, Barrister Festus Okoye, described the assent as \u201chistoric,\u201d noting a statement would be issued on the way forward after the commission\u2019s extraordinary meeting.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cToday, Friday, February 25, 2022, the president of the Federal Republic Nigeria signed the Electoral Bill 2022 into law.\n\n\u201cThis is historic, being the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in 1999 that the Electoral Act is repealed and re-enacted. It contains many progressive provisions that will facilitate the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe nation now has the Electoral Act 2022 which replaces the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the new Act constitutes the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cGiven the tight timelines contained in the new law, the Commission fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest.\n\n\u201cConsequently, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission is scheduled for tomorrow, Saturday, February 26, 2022. Thereafter, a statement will be issued on the way forward.\u201d\n\nNBA\u2019s commendations\n\nIn its reaction, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) lauded President Buhari for signing the Electoral Amendment Bill into Law.\n\nIts chairman, Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Dr. Onyekachi UbanI, gave the commendation Friday in Lagos, describing the assent as \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nUbani, however, said that assent to the bill came at the right time with the 2023 general elections underway.\n\n\u201cIt is a commendable step in the right direction, better late than never.\u201d\n\nSenate\u2019s promise\n\nReacting to the president\u2019s action, the Senate declared that it would expunge Section 84(12) that runs contrary to some provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nA statement issued by its spokesperson Friday, Senator Ajibola Basiru, read in part, \u201cThe Senate has taken notice of Section 84(12) of the Act, especially the concerns raised by Mr. President, and assured Nigerians that the National Assembly will give the Section the desired legislative attention.\u201d\n\nReps\u2019 take\n\nOn its part, the House of Representatives stated that signing of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into Law by President Buhari \u201cwill usher in a more robust democracy.\u201d\n\nIts spokesperson, Benjamin Kalu, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Friday in Abuja.\n\nKalu said signing the bill into law had opened various options of participation in politics, adding that there would be no room for excuses.\n\nAccording to him, this is a happy day for democracy in Nigeria; the ninth assembly has been a great voice to this achievement.\n\n\u201cWe have stood on the side of Nigerians to ensure that what was worth doing at all was worth doing well.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank the chairman of the National Assembly and the President of the Senate, Sen. Ahmed Lawal. We also thank the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\n\u201cThe two chambers have exhibited a lot of maturity in governance by not involving themselves in any ego trip, but by collaborating and cooperating with the executive.\n\n\u201cI am happy that finally, the president again, leaves a legacy that all of us will always remember. The president has done what was very difficult for many past administrations,\u201d Kalu said.\n\n\n\nAPC applauds\n\nApplauding President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law, the All progressives Congress (APC) described It as \u201ca big win for our electioneering processes and our democracy.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s national secretary, John James Akpanudoedehe, called on Nigerians to join the APC government \u201cto completely stamp out past practices of electoral fraud weaponised by past administrations of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\u201d\n\n\u201cSince 2015, when the President Buhari-led APC government came into being, our commitment and support for constitutionally-permitted innovations that will improve the transparency and credibility of Nigeria\u2019s electioneering processes and internal democracy, have not been in doubt. The new Electoral Act is another pointer.\n\n\u201cFrom legal backing given to election management bodies to review election results declared under duress, provisions for people with disabilities and special needs, electronic transmission of election results among other key provisions, current and coming generations will fondly remember President Buhari as the courageous leader who institutionalised credible elections and internal democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe note with appreciation the patriotic efforts of the National Assembly, civil societies, development partners and indeed all well-meaning Nigerians whose collective efforts and support has birthed the new Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe task of improving the credibility of our elections is a collective and continuous one. As a party and government, we will continue to champion needed reforms,\u2019 he said.\n\nPDP thumbs down\n\nDespite the avalanche of commendations from across the country, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the president\u2019s action as \u201ca death knell for the All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d\n\nThe party, in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, however, congratulated Nigerians, particularly civil society organisations, for fighting on its side in putting pressure on President Buhari to finally assent to the Bill.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe newly signed Electoral Act is a death knell for the All Progressives Congress (APC) which thrives in manipulations, ballot box snatching, ballot box stuffing and alteration of election results at the collation centers against the expressed Will of the people.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that President Buhari and the deflated APC has come to their wits end and bowed to the sustained pressure by the PDP and Nigerians for the entrenchment of processes that can guarantee free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe victory by Nigerians in resisting the APC and compelling President Buhari to sign the new Electoral Act clearly signposts the inevitable triumph of the will and aspiration of the people to kick out the APC through a process that ensures that votes cast at the polling units count.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu hails Buhari\n\nIn his reaction, a former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu, has commended President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 into law, saying \u201cthe journey to the new Electoral Act was by far the most frustrating.\u201d\n\nHe said this in a post on his verified Facebook page titled, \u2018The New Electoral Act Is Progress For Our Democracy,\u2019 shared on Friday shortly after the president signed the Bill into law.\n\n\u201cAfter the major electoral reform of 2010 that also involved amendments to the 1999 Constitution to, among others, open the doors to technology in our electoral system, check some executive excesses, manipulations by political parties, and strengthen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) through financial and administrative autonomy, our expectation after amendments to the Electoral Act in 2015 was that the new administration would support the National Assembly to further straighten our electoral laws and system.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, four times, the amendments were turned down in the 8th National Assembly, apparently thwarted by narrow, partisan interests and ambitions.\n\n\u201cThe efforts in the current National Assembly also faced similar challenges, but it is heart-warming that it has finally materialised with the presidential assent.\n\n\u201cWith the electronic transmission of election results, early primary elections, and adequate time for INEC to prepare for elections, among other breakthroughs, our elections will never be the same again and more Nigerians will be encouraged to exercise their franchise, knowing that their votes will count.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s call\n\nAccording to former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, the Independent National Electoral Commission should roll out election guidelines ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to him, this will enable political parties to commence the process of choosing their leaders in 2023.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cNow that the legal framework for the 2023 elections is in place following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Electoral Bill, @inecnigeria needs to roll out the election guidelines in earnest so that the political parties and Nigerians can fully commence the journey to choose their leaders in 2023.\n\n\u201cI wish to acknowledge the work of the legislature in bringing this law with innovations into fruition. I also pay tribute to the nudge of civil society and patriotic Nigerians in making this brand new Electoral Act a reality.\u201d\n\nSaraki\u2019s thumb-up\n\nOn his part, a former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has commended President Buhari, the National Assembly, CSOs and other Nigerians who remained persistent in insisting that \u201cNigeria deserves a new law that will guarantee free, fair and peaceful polls in 2023 and beyond.\u201d\n\nSaraki in a statement by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Head of Abubakar Bukola Saraki Media Office, noted that while President Buhari \u201cdeserves commendation for working with the federal legislature and rising above partisan interest to give the country a new law that could reform the electoral process, the big applause should go to the members of the civil society organisations who for the past one year have kept up the pressure and continuously agitated for the passage of the new Electoral Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new Electoral Act brings us closer to having free, fair, and peaceful elections in which people\u2019s votes count, where the majority will have their way and the minority will have their say. For too long, the old electoral law had been part of the problem. We can now seek to elect our leaders having in mind the current challenges facing our country.\n\n\u201cWith a new Electoral Act, we can move on to debating real solutions to the problems of insecurity, creation of jobs, strengthening of the economy, cementing national unity and building a better future for all Nigerians,\u201d Saraki said.",

We have diplomatic relations with Ukraine. It\u2019s a member of the United Nations, as well as Russia of course.\n\n\u201cWe urge that peace be prioritised by the two sides and we are very sad that the diplomatic process that was ongoing before this attack was cut short.\n\n\u201cWe support every effort being made to stop the aggression and that the Russian troops return to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the sovereignty of Ukraine and the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nRussian President, Vladimir Putin, in the early hours of Thursday, ordered an invasion of Ukraine. The invasion was marked by shelling and rocket attacks on several Ukrainian major cities, including the capital, Kyiv.\n\nSaturday marks the third day of the invasion where according to the Ukrainian Health Minister, 198 civilians including three children have been confirmed dead.\n\nRussia also brushed off the barrage of Western sanctions and said it had fired cruise missiles at military targets.\n\nAccording to NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, Ukrainian forces are putting up resistance and inflicting damage on Russia\u2019s military as it seeks to push deeper into the country.",

          "text": "Russia said on Friday it was partially limiting access to Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s Facebook, accusing it of \u201ccensoring\u201d Russian media, the latest in a series of steps against U.S. social media giants.\n\nMoscow has been trying to exert tighter control over the internet and big tech for years, something critics say threatens individual and corporate freedom, and is part of a wider crackdown against outspoken opponents of the Kremlin.\n\nThe state communications regulator said that Facebook had ignored its demands to lift restricts on four Russian media outlets on its platform \u2013 RIA news agency, the defence ministry\u2019s Zvezda TV and websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Russia\u2019s restrictions on Facebook would involve. Last year Moscow slowed down the speed of Twitter in a punitive move.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the decision of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, starting from Feb. 25, partial access restrictions are being imposed by Roskomnadzor on the Facebook social network,\u201d the regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement.\n\nFacebook, which had no immediate comment, has already irked Russia\u2019s authorities. Moscow routinely fines the company small sums for what it says is a failure to delete illegal content quickly enough.\n\nIn December, it issued a much bigger fine of 2 billion roubles ($24.27 million) for what it described as a repeated failure to delete content.\n\nMoscow has also increased pressure on domestic media, threatening to block reports that contain what it describes as \u201cfalse information\u201d regarding its military operation in Ukraine, where Russian missiles were pounding Kyiv and families cowered in shelters.",
