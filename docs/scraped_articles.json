          "text": "Friday Olokor\n\nNigeria recorded 86,000 new HIV infections and 49,000 deaths from HIV-related illnesses in 2020, according to the National Agency for the Control of AIDS.\n\nAs a result, a coalition of civil society organisations in sexual and reproductive health response has raised concerns over the low prevalence of contraceptive use, especially female condoms among Nigerian women.\n\nThey, therefore, stressed the need to encourage further investments in the production of condoms in Nigeria.\n\nThe CSOs bared their minds during the 2021 World AIDS Day symposium organized by Pathfinder International Nigeria in Abuja.\n\nThey emphasized that collective action was critical to the efforts by Nigeria towards addressing the risks.\n\nWhile emphasizing that three out of every five new HIV infections were girls, the stakeholders said that 83 percent of women in Nigeria were not using any form of contraception during sex.\n\nThe Research, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of NACA, Tosin Adebanjo, said the agency had estimated that about 1.7 million people are living with HIV in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe latest number of new infections in 2020 is 86,000. For the same year, we estimate about 49,000 people died from HIV-related illnesses. We have seen that out of 100 people who are living with HIV, 21 of them report one form of stigma and discrimination or the other.\n\n\u201cReducing and eliminating stigma and discrimination is a responsibility that belongs to everyone of us in the society. We want to foster an environment in Nigeria where people living with HIV and AIDS are comfortable to seek treatment and disclose their status. Our challenge is funding, and we expect domestic resources to fill in that gap.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary, Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria, Emmanuel Clifford, said any discussion on preventing new HIV infections would be incomplete without talking about the female condom.\n\nHe said, \u201cGiven our stated objective to end inequalities in the HIV/AIDS response, it is critical that we develop a robust system to support the widespread adoption of the female condom. Our 17 per cent female contraceptive use seems pale when compared to a need the 83 per cent who need one form of protection or the other during sexual intercourse.\u201d\n\nThe NEPWHAN Scribe identified some cultural and religious beliefs as hindrances, stressing the need to focus on increased awareness as a way to boost demand and use of the female condom.\n\nThe Media and Communication Officer of Pathfinder International Nigeria, Bayo Ewuola, regretted that inequalities still existed in the nation\u2019s healthcare system, and called on the government to fully implement its anti-stigma laws, especially in HIV response and services.\n\n\u201cInequality exists in the healthcare system. We know how difficult it is for people to access HIV and Sexual and Reproductive Health Services, especially in hard-to-reach areas. To improve our HIV response, we need to have an enabling environment in terms of policy implementation.\n\n\u201cThere are quite a lot of policies and guidelines that are in existence, such as the anti-stigmatization legislation, but we need the government to strictly implement these laws,\u201d Ewuola said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

South African epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim says it was detected first in Botswana and then in South Africa where the announcement of the new variant was made on November 25.\n\nOn Tuesday Dutch authorities announced that six days before that on November 19 an individual had tested positive for what also turned out to be the Omicron variant.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organisation said \u201cthe first known laboratory-confirmed case was identified from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021\u201d, without specifying where.\n\n\u201cIt has probably been circulating in South Africa for longer than we thought \u2013 since early October,\u201d Jean-Francois Delfraissy, president of the French government\u2019s scientific advisory board told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Why is it \u201cof concern\u201d? \u2013\n\nThe day after South Africa\u2019s announcement the WHO named the new variant after a Greek letter, like previous versions, and classified it a variant \u201cof concern\u201d.\n\nThe classification is based on Omicron\u2019s genetic characteristics and also how it seems to have behaved in the population so far.\n\nOmicron\u2019s unique genetic structure translates to multiple changes to the spike protein that might make it more contagious and harder to control via current vaccines \u2013 but these possibilities are so far theoretical.\n\nMeanwhile, cases in the Gauteng province of South Africa, which includes Johannesburg, have gone up rapidly with many identified as Omicron.\n\nResearchers across the world are looking into how contagious Omicron is, the severity of the disease it causes, and whether it is more resistant to vaccines.\n\nThe WHO has said the process will likely take weeks.\n\n\u2013 Will it replace Delta? \u2013\n\nThe Delta variant is currently the form of COVID-19 that is the most sequenced across the globe.\n\nNaturally-competing variants that evolved after Delta (like lesser-known Mu and Lambda) have not managed to overtake it in the population \u2014 but the spread of Omicron in Gauteng suggests it could.\n\nOn Thursday the European Centre for Disease Control said that if the pattern in South Africa is reproduced in Europe, Omicron could make up the majority of COVID-19 cases within a few months.\n\nHowever, Delta was never very present in South Africa, so a comparison with Europe is hard to draw at this stage.\n\nWriting in the British daily The Guardian, US expert Eric Topol said it is not clear whether Omicron\u2019s spread is because of \u201chigh transmission, like Delta, or immune evasion\u201d.\n\nImmune evasion is when a virus can infect a person who has already gained immunity either from a previous infection or from vaccination.\n\n\u2013 Is it more dangerous? \u2013\n\nOn Sunday, a South African doctor said she had treated about 30 cases of Omicron and had only encountered \u201cmild symptoms\u201d in these patients.\n\nThe scientific community warned against drawing conclusions based on this testimony since the patients were mostly young and therefore less at risk of serious COVID-19.\n\nSo far, all cases detected in Europe are \u201ceither asymptomatic or with mild symptoms\u201d, according to the EDCD.\n\nThis does not mean that Omicron will not cause serious Covid \u2013 but it does leave the door open to a rare optimistic hypothesis.\n\n\u201cIf Omicron is very contagious but doesn\u2019t cause severe Covid (and doesn\u2019t fill hospital beds), it could confer group immunity and contribute to making SARS-CoV-2 into a benign seasonal virus, which would help end the crisis,\u201d French virologist Bruno Canard tweeted.\n\nHe added, however, that such a scenario would be a \u201cstroke of luck\u201d.\n\n\u2013 What about vaccines ? \u2013\n\nAgain, it is too early to say whether vaccines will be less effective against transmission or severe disease from Omicron than against other variants.\n\n\u201cWe have to see whether the antibodies produced by current vaccines still work and to what extent \u2013 whether they still prevent severe illness,\u201d said Enouf.\n\nWhile waiting for real-world data, scientists are trying to answer this question through lab tests.\n\nBut even if vaccines are less effective against Omicron it doesn\u2019t mean they will be totally ineffective.\n\nIn addition to the antibody response that could be weakened by mutations in Omicron, the body has secondary T-cell responses that can protect against severe illness.\n\n\u201cWe think that the cell response will be partly effective against Omicron,\u201d said Delfraissy.\n\n(AFP)",

Therefore, we must expand the usage of our forces. We must deregulate politics because that will now release economic potentials for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI believe in what the National Assembly or what the legislature proposed in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill that there must be direct primaries. The proposal must be upheld by the President. No matter the cost. I believe we need good leadership. The imperative of good leadership is much higher than the cost involved.\u201d\n\nHe urged the president to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, saying \u201cNigerians have a pulse, and I don\u2019t think it will augur well for the country; if Nigeria\u2019s democracy continues to be held ransom by our governments.\u201d\n\nThe guest lecturer, Barrister Muzammil Yahaya, in his presentation, said the removal of oil subsidy has to be looked at from various dimensions.\n\nOn the state of the nation\u2019s democracy, he explained that Nigerians ought to be involved in every decision to be considered.\n\n\u201cInasmuch as I see subsidy removal as a necessity, but it\u2019s the wrong time for such a policy. So, I urged the federal government to consider more opinions and to hear from Nigeria\u2019s Federal issue here louder,\u201d he said\n\nOn his part, CNG Spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said It\u2019s time for the younger generation to rise, struggle and walk to the place this leader who thinks power is their birthright. Mobilize young people during elections and leave us divided.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou cannot change a system unless you have to be in the system. Gone is the day when our students would be dictated to their actions and they would be decided by people who have dominated or prefer to use the word manipulate them.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered substituted service on the Attorney General of the 36 states of the federation in a suit against the 36 states of the federation seeking total financial autonomy for the nation\u2019s judiciary.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIn an originating summons marked FHC/ABJ/CS/502/2021, the plaintiff, Emeka Okoye, sued the 36 states through their Attorney Generals.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the hearing date fixed for December 7, the court has granted leave in favour the plaintiff to serve the 36 state Attorney Generals by substituted means by posting the originating summons and other processes through Courier services to be delivered to their various addresses.\n\nSpecifically, Justice Binta Nyako had after hearing an exparte motion by counsel to the plaintiff, Chief Oba Maduabuchi (SAN), appointed a national courier outfit, Red Star Express, as special bailiff to effect service of the originating summons and other accompanied processes on the defendants as good and proper service.\n\nIn moving the exparte motion, the senior lawyer had submitted that originating summons for service on the defendants outside jurisdiction of court issuing the writ is governed by the provisions of sections 97 and 99 of Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and not the rules of the court issuing the originating summons.\n\nHe further submitted that without the leave of the court sought and obtained, the service of the originating processes on the defendants will be null and void and liable to be set aside upon application by the defendants.\n\nAlso listed as defendants in the originating summons dated June 18, 2021, are the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF).\n\nIn the substantive suit, the plaintiff, is seeking an order of the Federal High Court, \u201cdirecting the Federation Account Allocation Committee (2nd defendant) to henceforth pay directly all monies standing to the credit of the judiciary to the National Judicial Council (NJC).\n\nAmong the questions he formulated for the court to find an answer to in resolving the matter is \u201cWhether by the provisions of sections 121 (1), (2) and (3) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), it is proper for the state Governor to include the budgetary expenditure of the judiciary in the state which is charged upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the state in the budgetary estimates the Governor presents to the state House of Assembly?\u201d\n\nHe also asked, \u201cWhether by the provisions of section 121 (3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria(as amended), it is proper to pay funds standing to the credit of the judiciary in the state to any other person or authority outside the heads of court in the various states as directed by section 121(3) of the 1999 constitution?\n\n\u201cWhether by the community reading of sections 81(3), 121(3) and 162(9) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria(as amended), the Federation Account Allocation Committee is right in paying the fund standing to the credit of the judiciary to various state Governors

disbursements of funds due to the judiciary from the federation account to be paid directly to the National Judicial Council and not any other person or authority.\n\nThe lawyer added that the constitution equally makes provisions for how funds standing to the credit of the judiciary from the consolidated funds in the states are to be disbursed a and paid directly to the various heads of courts of the various states.\n\nHe however noted that under the system being adopted in violation of the constitution, funds meant for the judiciary are being to the governors of the 36 states, instead of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and heads of court in the states.\n\nHe said the direct payment of the fund due to the judiciary to the governors of the 36 states \u201cis against the spirit and letters of the 1999 constitution.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the NJC \u201cis the only body authorised by the constitution to receive and distribute funds due to the judiciary either in states

The new cases reported Wednesday represent a 16.5% positivity rate of cases tested, up from a 1% rate early in November.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s previous surge, driven by the delta variant in June and July, saw daily new cases reach a peak of more than 20,000. With a population of 60 million people, South Africa has recorded more than 2.9 million COVID-19 cases, including nearly 90,000 deaths.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to be certain that the omicron variant is responsible for the rise in cases, but it is very possible, say experts. Standard PCR tests can suggest that a positive case is caused by omicron, but only a full genetic sequencing can confirm it.\n\nLabs in South Africa and Botswana are urgently doing genomic sequencing to study omicron cases in order to see if it is significantly more transmissible, causes more serious cases of COVID-19 or if it evades protection from vaccinations, said Gumede-Moeletsi.\n\n\u201cThe current data that we\u2019re having is still very limited. So there are so many additional characteristics of this virus that the researchers are busy studying, of which transmissibility is one of them. Severity is also another,\u201d she said, adding that researchers also need to find out if current vaccines will still be effective against it.\n\nHospitalizations for COVID-19 are rising in South Africa, but not at the dramatic rate of the new cases.\n\nThe omicron variant has been detected in five of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces and accounted for 74% of the virus genomes sequenced in November, the country\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases announced Wednesday.\n\nThe earliest detection of the variant in South Africa may have been on Nov. 8 in Gauteng province, according to data released by the institute. It said until the end of October, the delta variant accounted for most genomes sequenced in the country, but in November the omicron variant overtook it.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Nigeria gets 1.683m bpd January quota\n\n*Receives Dec. 17 deadline to submit compliance plan\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite concerns over the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, and recent emergency oil reserves releases by a United States-led coalition, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ yesterday resolved to stick with its current production policy of 400,000 bpd monthly increases in January.\n\nThe decision came as a surprise to market watchers who were expecting the producers\u2019 group to temporarily halt the July 2021 agreement to tame the expected oversupply from the first quarter of 2022, owing to the added threat of renewed lockdown by some nations.\n\nA number of analysts had expected the group to pause its monthly increase next month in light of the upcoming strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) release by key crude buyers and the recent emergence of Omicron, a potentially more transmissible Covid-19 strain.\n\nIn July, OPEC+ had agreed on a roadmap to restore all of the production it removed from the market in May last year in response to the Covid-19-induced collapse in oil demand.\n\nThe roadmap entailed a 400,000bpd increase in the group\u2019s collective quota every month through to April next year, followed by a rise of 432,000 bpd each month until all of the original cut is unwound.\n\nThe increases must be rubber-stamped at monthly ministerial meetings and can be paused for up to three months if market conditions warrant it.\n\nThe group also agreed to a six-month extension to the deadline for its compensation scheme which imposes additional cuts for countries that produce above target to the end of June 2022.\n\nIn reaction, oil prices were largely bearish for the rest of the day. Specifically, Brent crude, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, was $1.21, or 1.7 per cent lower at $67.66 a barrel as of yesterday afternoon, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.24, or 1.8 per cent, to $64.33.\n\nGlobal oil prices have lost more than $10 a barrel since last Thursday, when news of Omicron first shook investors, but OPEC and its allies insisted on releasing more oil into the market next month in line with previous months.\n\nAlso weighing on the market was weekly US inventory data showing that US crude stocks fell less than expected last week, while petrol and distillate inventories rose much more than expected while demand weakened.\n\nA statement released after meeting stated: \u201cThe 23rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), was held via videoconference, on Thursday December 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe meeting reaffirmed the continued commitment of the participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to ensure a stable and balanced oil market.\n\n\u201cIn view of current oil market fundamentals, the meeting resolved to reaffirm the decision of the 10th ONOMM on April 12, 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings including the 19th ONOMM on July 18, 2021.\n\n\u201cIt reconfirmed the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th ONOMM and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of January 2022.\n\n\u201cIt agreed that the meeting shall remain in session pending further developments of the pandemic and continue to monitor the market closely and make immediate adjustments if required.\u201d\n\nOPEC noted that it was extending the compensation period until the end of June 2022 as requested by some underperforming countries and requested that they submit their plans by December 17, 2021.\n\n\u201cCompensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th ONOMM,\u201d it added.\n\nWhile reiterating the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism, the organisation resolved to hold the 24th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting on January 4, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria has received a production output allocation of 1.683 million bpd for January, in spite of its inability to meet previous quotas.\n\nThe country has been lagging in its capacity to produce enough as a result of ageing upstream infrastructure, sabotage and oil theft as well as difficulty in restarting the oil wells that were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently assured that by the end of the year, Nigeria would be able to ramp up its production to at least 1.7 million bpd.\n\nDespite the over 1.6 million bpd allocated to Nigeria in September and October, the country was only to supply 1.399 million bpd and 1.354 million barrels in the two separate months.\n\nKyari argued that although Nigeria has faltered in meeting its OPEC allocation, by the end of the year, the country may be able to hit 1.8 million bpd, excluding condensates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that by the close of the year, we will get back to the 1.7 barrels to 1.8 barrels per day of crude oil. When I mention this figure, I am only talking about crude oil because we also produce condensates and when you combine, we can easily hit 2.0 million barrels by the end of the year,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe GMD reiterated that Nigeria was hugely impacted by its inability to restart the oil facilities after the Covid-19-induced shutdowns, emphasising that with the fresh clarity around the fiscal environment with the introduction of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), more investments were being expected in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear, during the covid-19 pandemic, we shut down some of these wells and they usually don\u2019t come back as early as we want them. Right now, we do have some challenges around the facilities and these are being taken care of. There\u2019s enormous work going on that will get us back before the end of the year,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Be rest assured, whenever you walk, we will walk with you. We will be by your side. Whenever you run, we will run with you to the end,\u201d Badmus assured on behalf of LASU students.\n\nSanwo-Olu who had the first session with the Students Representatives Council, charged the students to join hands with the state government and LASU management for the institution to make it competitive among notable universities in the world.\n\nSanwo-Olu during the sitting announced a donation of two brand new big buses to the SUG to ease movement around the campus as well as other gadgets and equipment for students\u2019 use.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to tell you that we are in this journey together and together, we will build the biggest university in the whole of Africa and it will compete with the greatest universities in the entire world.\n\n\u201cI feel highly honoured that all of you have turned out in large numbers to come and see the possibilities of what we can do collectively.\n\n\u201cThis arcade will provide the right atmosphere for the leadership of the Student Union of LASU and opportunity for students\u2019 management better relationship.

          "text": "*Fixes December 10 for mock auction\n\n*Restates plan to launch 5G Network next year\n\nEmma Okonji in Lagos and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), yesterday confirmed that three telecoms operators submitted their Expression of Interest (EoI) to the commission to bid for the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, whose auction date has been fixed for December 13, 2021.\n\nThe NCC in a statement signed by its Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, disclosed that it received their applications to bid for the spectrum.\n\nAdinde also said the three bidders met all criteria, including the payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM), which pegged the initial deposit at 10 per cent of the reserved bid price of $197.4 million (N75 billion).\n\nHe said the NCC had already fixed December 10 for a mandatory mock bidding, ahead of the main bidding process that will hold December 13, 2021.\n\nThe three bidders are MTN Nigeria Plc, Airtel Networks Limited and Mafab Communications Limited. All three bidders paid N7.5 billion each as non-refundable initial deposit, which is 10 per cent of the reserved bid price.\n\nAlthough Mafab Communications is not known in the Nigerian telecoms space, THISDAY gathered that it is a new entrant and a strategic investor with a non-mobile licence that is investing in one of the small telecoms operators in Nigeria.\n\nThe NCC stated: \u201cConsistent with its regulatory principle of open and transparent auction, the NCC has announced that three telecoms companies have qualified as approved bidders of the forthcoming 3.5 gigahertz (Ghz) spectrum auction for the deployment of Fifth generation (5G) networks in the country.\n\n\u201cThe qualified bidders that have met the criteria for participation in the licensing process of 3.5Ghz spectrum, including payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM), are MTN Nigeria Plc, Mafab Communications Limited and Airtel Networks Limited.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the stage is now set for the three companies to participate in the main auction as well as in the mandatory Mock Auction process, which will come as a precursor to the main auction.\u201d\n\nThe commission has also reaffirmed the dates for the conduct of both the mock auction and the main auction. The mock auction was scheduled to hold on Friday, December 10, 2021 at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, while the main auction will hold on Monday, December 13, 2021 at same venue and same time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management of the Nigerian NCC, Mr. Adeleke Adewolu, has expressed the commission\u2019s readiness to launch the 5G network in 2022.\n\nAdewolu who made this known in his speech yesterday, at the agency stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum held in Port Harcourt, stated that the recent engagement of the stakeholders was, \u201cto formally commence efforts towards the launch of 5G networks,, next year.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cThis would enable Nigerians enjoy cutting-edge technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing; Quantum Computing, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the forum titled, \u201cTalk to the Regulator,\u201d Adewolu said it was held at a crucial point in the evolution of the telecoms sector, not just in Nigeria, but globally.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe NCC is currently leading the industry to facilitate the rollout of broadband infrastructure so that Nigeria can achieve the target of 70 per cent broadband penetration to at least 90 per cent of the population by 2025 as articulated in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP 2020-2025).\u201d\n\nAdewolu added that NCC was assisting to put in place critical supporting infrastructure that would facilitate Nigeria\u2019s emergence as a truly digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to develop a comprehensive national citizens\u2019 identity database on which every other sector of the economy which requires citizen identification can leverage,\u201d Adewolu disclosed.\n\nHowever, in his keynote speech, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, stated that the objective of the programme with the theme: \u201cImproving Stakeholders Satisfaction,\u201d was embedded in the NCC\u2019s Strategic Vision Plan (SVP 2021-2025).\u201d\n\nDanbatta listed the vision as, \u201cOrganisational renewal for operational efficiency and regulatory excellence, facilitate the provision of infrastructure for a digital economy which fosters national development.\u201d\n\nAlso, it \u201cpromotes fair competition, inclusive growth, increased investment and innovative services, and facilitate strategic collaboration and partnership.\u201d\n\nRepresented by Adewolu, the NCC Vice Chairman disclosed that such stakeholders\u2019 gathering was earlier held in Kano for the north and Lagos for the south-west, saying the Port Harcourt session was for the south-south and south-east regions.\n\nHe noted that the successes achieved by the industry were because the commission put stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction at the centre of her activities.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo sustain past achievements and reach new heights, we need all our stakeholders, particularly our licensees, to be fully on board. We need you to key into our programmes and to operate with maximum efficiency.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his remarks, the Director, Licencing and Authorisation Department, NCC, Mr. Mohammed Babajika, stressed that despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its resultant challenges, the Commission is further liberalising the Telecoms industry finalising the framework for Mobile Virtual Network Operator and currently reviewing existing regulations.\n\nSome of the stakeholders that spoke with THISDAY at the forum were Doreen Ekeh, Retail manager for the Port Harcourt branch of Airtel Network and Emmanuel Aneke with Smile Network.

It\u2019s a similar problem in biology; molecules don\u2019t work the way they\u2019re supposed to after a while because a left-handed glove can actually convert into a right-handed glove that doesn\u2019t fit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe body has a process of clearing these spent or defective proteins from cells, known as autophagy. But according to UCR, autophagy slows down in people over the age of 65, although it is not clear exactly why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis slowing down of autophagy is what the scientists suspect to be the cause of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIf a slowdown in autophagy is the underlying cause, things that increase it should have the beneficial, opposite effect,\u201d Julian said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology? Did Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s story inspire you? Then, we\u2019d love to hear your story. Kindly reach out to me (emmanuel@techpoint.africa) or my colleague, Oluwanifemi (oluwanifemi@techpoint.africa).

Oui Capital and other angel investors also participated in the round.\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work: Interestingly, Herconomy closed the funding round in just 24 hours. A feat that was achieved thanks to the Herconomy community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how? It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities. End AIDS. End Pandemics.\n\nAn awareness campaign that the stigma attached to people living with AIDS can be just as deadly as the disease.\n\nIn a press statement by the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the world \u201ccould face 7.7 million AIDS-related deaths over the next ten years\u201d if inequalities are not addressed.\n\nToday\u2019s insight on AIDS is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here.\n\nOctamile raises $500k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctamile Founder, Gbenro Dara\n\nOctamile, an African insurtech startup, has closed a $500,000 pre-seed round to simplify access to insurance for Africans.\n\nThe funding round was led by EchoVC. Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance? According to Dara, \u201cinsurance is one sector that has the power to elevate the economy, but only about 5 out of 100 Africans have any form of insurance protection.\u201d\n\nData by Statista corroborates this statement, revealing that Africa accounts for less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nOfferZen\u2019s $5.1m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfferZone team.

When it comes to fundraising, for some, it could be as easy as getting funds in two hours, and for others, it could take as much as nine years\n\nThe fundraising journey can be very tedious, and as Bashir Aminu, Payourse CEO, told Techpoint Africa on a call yesterday, it took a while for everything to come together.\n\nToday, Payourse announces a $600,000 pre-seed, which saw participation from Michael Ugwu, Flori Ventures, Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Others include CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg; Kola Aina, Managing Partner, Ventures Platform; Angel Touch Holdings; and Oluwatobi Anisere.\n\nThis is the company\u2019s first real funding round, with the combination of a $100,000 raise from Ugwu in March 2021, another $100,000 from Flori Ventures in July 2021 and an angel investment from Payourse\u2019s co-founder, John Anisere\u2019s brother, Oluwatobi Anisere in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Aminu tells Techpoint Africa that they never actually reached out to investors. Ugwu sent a Direct Message to one of the co-founders on Twitter, Flori Ventures was introduced through a partner and so was Olumide Soyombo, Founder of Volton Capital.\n\nBut the early days of applying to accelerators and getting rejected \u2014 they applied to Y Combinator twice and got rejected both times \u2014 taught them an important lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was getting the meeting with the investors that was the problem. We realised that once we actually get a meeting with an investor and talk to them, they want to invest. The first day we had a call with Michael, he wanted to invest.\u201d The same story with Flori Ventures, Aminu says.\n\nThe journey into entrepreneurship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Aminu, Anisere, and Hakeem Orewole co-founded Payourse, launching the company\u2019s first product, Coinprofile.\n\nAminu had dropped out of a five-year programme in the Federal University of Technology, Minna in 2017, but had caught the crypto bug before then.\n\n\u201cI found out about crypto from a friend and then I bought some and since then I became obsessed. Because it was interesting to me and I was someone who was really curious back in school, and II didn\u2019t really understand how it could be money and wanted to understand it. I kind of went into a rabbit hole of trying to understand how bitcoin and crypto works.\u201d\n\nThat same year, he met Orewole on an online crypto forum and the two became good friends. So good that both founded a crypto startup in the same year.\n\nUnfortunately, it failed because, as Aminu laughingly says, \u201cI was very young then and didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d They went on to found another startup in 2018, but this one \u201cfailed even faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, Aminu decided the startup life was not for him and decided to take his chances in the labour market.\n\nDuring his undergraduate days, he had learnt graphic design and soon got a job with an Australian company where he learnt a little bit of product designing while in his role as a graphic designer.\n\nHe moved to Busha \u2014 where he met Anisere \u2014 and then to TeamApt, Yellow Card, Interswitch, and finally Binance.\n\nWhat is a Payourse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayourse\u2019s homepage\n\nOn Monday, November 22, 2021, Aminu announced on Twitter a new parent company, Payourse.\n\nToday, I'm excited to introduce our new parent brand.\n\n\n\nMeet Payourse @payourse. We're passionate about accelerating access to crypto for Africans by providing tools that make it easier, faster and cheaper for businesses to build user-friendly crypto products like @coinpHQ. \u2014 Bash \u6211\u521b\u9020 \u272a (@scozky) November 22, 2021\n\nBut as he tells Techpoint during our call, Payourse has been in existence since 2019, when they first founded Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cWell, we actually created Payourse, a long time ago, in 2019 as a parent company, but we never really announced it to the world. But it\u2019s always been the parent company. And we\u2019ve always had this long term vision of a company which would build user-friendly products on top of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to make crypto accessible to everyone, as Aminu strongly believes it is the future of finance in Africa.\n\nAfrica is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally with six countries \u2014 Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania \u2014 making it into the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20.\n\nThe Web3 \u2014 a decentralised version of the Internet built on public blockchains \u2014 craze has also been making waves, with increasing noise being made in crypto and blockchain spaces.\n\nHowever, apart from creating accessible products is the vision to be the crypto powerhouse, a go-to for any organisation looking to build or integrate Web3 or crypto products.\n\nPayourse currently has two major products, Coinprofile and Simpa.\n\nThe first iteration of Coinprofile was a Disha but for crypto wallets.\n\n\u201cI used to be an OTC (over-the-counter) trader, so anytime someone wants to send me crypto, and I always have to go to my wallet address and copy wallet address and send it to them. It was a very tedious process.\u201d\n\nFrom experience, he knew that other traders faced the same issues, so the idea was for people to create an account and store all their wallet addresses, and a unique link is created, leading to a landing page. This was where the name coinprofile came from. It doesn\u2019t require sign-ups, and there are no transaction charges.\n\nThe current remittance product came in May. Now, users can send cryptocurrency to anyone and receive it in cash in their bank accounts.\n\nThen there\u2019s Simpa, a no-code tool that enables businesses to create their own crypto exchange.\n\nThe numbers and the challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith free transfers, how does Payourse make money? Well, Aminu tells Techpoint that they earn an average of 1.5 \u2013 2% and sometimes even as much as 10% per transaction.\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile, with millions of dollars processed on the platform. Since its launch, the exchange has grown 15,000% across all touchpoints and maintained a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nAminu says Simpa is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version and is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks.\n\nBut building a company always comes with its challenges. And two of the biggest have been talent and marketing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve faced challenges in hiring. In fact, we\u2019ve had to let go of two of our employees. We had to hire them at that point because we hadn\u2019t raised a lot of funding, and we couldn\u2019t get a lot of really good people to apply for our roles.\u201d\n\nIn the end, they\u2019ve had to settle for junior to mid-level developers, with most senior developers opting to work for international companies.\n\nWith a team of eight and three technical founders, they\u2019ve had to rely on word of mouth and judging by their numbers, they might not be doing too badly, but Aminu tells us that an essential hire in the wake of this raise is hiring a Growth or Marketing person.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from hiring, Aminu outlines two critical things this fund would be used for: building out current products to package them for sales and making existing use cases better.\n\nIn a round that was oversubscribed up to $2 million, Aminu says there\u2019s no rush to get more funding.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe Payourse will be the powerhouse of crypto in Africa. When a business wants to develop crypto products for the African market or wants to integrate crypto into what they already have, we are the go-to.\n\n\u201cOur plan is not just to build infrastructure, but also build use cases around the infrastructure. We already have Coinprofile and Simpa. It might take a while, but we are not honestly looking to raise a $100 million very quickly. We want to, first of all, have a business and a clear path to revenue. The funding will come.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The AFW promises guests a visual spectacle that will celebrate art, fashion and music made in Nigeria that are taking the world by storm.\n\nOriginally scheduled from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021 and then postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dubai Expo is from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.\n\nThe theme of the Expo is \u201cConnecting Minds, Creating the Future\u201d. The expo also has three subthemes: opportunity, mobility and sustainability each with its own pavilion.\n\nNigeria\u2019s pavilion \u2013 located in the Opportunity category \u2013 features a lifesize sculpture of a majestic horse by Nigerian metal sculptor Dotun Popoola, who is renowned for \u201ctransforming trash to treasures, rubbish to rubies and waste to wealth\u201d in a bid to save the ecosystem.\n\nRead also: Air Peace resumes Dubai flights Dec 1\n\nOver 190 countries are taking part in the Dubai Expo 2020 and the Arise Fashion Week, in collaboration with the Dubai Expo 2020 Nigerian Pavilion and the Federal Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment, will be showcasing the best of African fashion designers and music at the expo.\n\nRenowned designers will showcase their collections: Lisa Folawiyo, Ituen Basi, Banke Kuku, Onalaja, Tjwho, Lagos Space Programme, Huddaya. Long-term partner of Arise Fashion Week, Naomi Campbell will be making an appearance alongside other global celebrities.\n\nFor decades African fashion has been on the backburner of international fashion and Arise is committed to changing the narrative. AFW has been at the forefront of promoting and celebrating the next generation of African fashion designers and providing a platform for designers to showcase their work. Its award last year promoted 30 designers selected from a group of 150 talented designers. The whole ceremony was televised on ARISE News and streamed on ARISE Play. It was the first time ever that winners received monetary prizes. The winner Kenneth Ize received $100,000 cash prize while runners-up R\u00e9 Lagos and South African Mmuso Maxwell received $75,000 and $50,000 respectively.\n\nThe Nigerian and African fashion industry, like all other sectors of the economy, was negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic but the African Development Bank estimates that the African fashion business is worth $31 billion, which presents a huge opportunity for the business of fashion and the continent\u2019s economy.",

          "text": "Egypt\u2019s ambassador to Nigeria, Ihab Moustafa Awad has disclosed that in the past, Egypt\u2019s embassy in Abuja used to receive about 30 visa applications daily but during the ban of Emirates flights, the number increased to 300 applications, showing a 900 percent increase.\n\nAwad however acknowledged the slow pace of the applications attributing it to lack of capacity both at the Egypt Embassy in Nigeria and the Nigerian embassy in Egypt but revealed that his administration is working on an electronic visa that would make it easier for applicants to send in their applications from anywhere in the country instead of travelling to Abuja.\n\nOn February 1, 2021, Emirates airline directed that Nigerian travellers at the Lagos and Abuja airports must conduct rapid COVID-19 tests before departure. The Federal Government reciprocated and imposed a ban on Emirates flights into Nigeria.\n\nWhile the ban lasted, African national carriers like EgyptAir took advantage of the situation by collaborating with the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA) on increasing intra African trade and tourism. The effect of that collaboration saw a huge influx of tourists from Nigeria to Cairo, Egypt\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting at the Lagos office of Egypt Air recently, Susan Akporiaye, the President of NANTA, said before now, travel agents often sell Dubai route more than other routes but when the ban on flights happened, the association had to collaborate with African carriers to explore better options and Egypt has since become the most preferred destination for tourists.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 enabled everyone to start looking inwards and we started having a rethink on what we can do because we needed to find a way to keep living and doing business. Borders were not closed so much in Africa and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agenda came up strongly. For us in the travel sector, we decided to push the tourism sector.\n\nRead also: Emirates to resume daily flight to Nigeria Dec. 5\n\n\u201cSo the NANTA team visited all the African countries that have a national carrier flying into Nigeria and Egypt Air was among the airlines we visited. Since we started the campaign to open up new destinations, Egypt has been the best destination for us. We found out that there is a huge clothing and textile industry in Egypt and that is one of the things that take Nigerians to Dubai, yet we have it in Africa,\u201d Akporiaye said.\n\nShe added that since NANTA started the campaign, Egypt Air has had full flights.\n\nMuharram Abdel Rahman, the country manager for EgyptAir, said when the governments of Nigeria and UAE banned flights to and from Dubai, Egypt Air saw an opportunity and decided to take advantage of it by collaborating with NANTA on how to increase trade and tourism between Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nRahman said the result of the collaboration saw a 400 percent increase of Nigerian tourists to Egypt.\n\n\u201cIn every field, when opportunities present themselves, you should be able to catch them. So when there was the suspension of flights between the UAE and Nigeria, it was a great opportunity for us to take advantage of it. After our meeting with NANTA, we started advertising Egypt as a favourable destination for Nigerians for tourism and trade.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we used to have about 50 tourists weekly but now that number has grown to about 250 weekly of people visiting Egypt from Nigeria weekly and our flights are always full,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The sharp spike seen in the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant in some sub-Saharan African countries is occurring without reflection on Nigeria\u2019s epidemic curve, a week after the variant emerged.\n\nNigeria\u2019s course of COVID-19 infection has maintained a daily average of 80 cases in the last one month, free of any repeat of the last daily peak of 711 cases recorded in October, which stoked fears of a fourth wave.\n\nCases in the last one week have hovered below 200 daily.\n\nHowever, the emergence of Omicron has seen cases surge by 105 percent through the African continent to 52, 300 cases, with South Africa solely accounting for 31,000 new COVID-19 infections, the Africa Centre for Disease Control states.\n\nData from South Africa, for instance, demonstrates Omicron is driving an upswing that is steeper than Delta as daily new cases and hospitalisations have risen more than five times in a week.\n\nRead Also: COVID-19: Nigeria\u2019s active cases surpass 9,000 on spiking infections\n\nBut the lack of widespread testing in Nigeria and the low capacity for genomic surveillance has had experts cast doubts on whether the figures aggregated by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) captures most cases in several parts of the country.\n\nDiseases experts say the detection of the new variant by South Africa and the evidence of rising infections that has come to light is both a result of resilient surveillance and testing, an area Nigeria is yet to fully develop.\n\nThe rate of testing for COVID-19 in Nigeria at 3.4 million lags behind 19.5 million in South Africa, 10.4 million in Morocco, 3.8 million in Ethiopia and 3.6 million in Egypt, data on Worldometer, a COVID-19 data gathering site, shows.\n\nSouth Africa has tested 323, 509 of every one million persons compared with 16, 309 in one million in Nigeria.\n\nOyewale Tomori, a professor of virology told BusinessDay that testing in Nigeria is not enough, untimely and inconsistent, noting that countries serious about curbing the virus test as many contacts as they can reach and go after community testing of regular people who are not sick.\n\nAlthough Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s epicentre of COVID-19 infection stayed put on testing for a period, with follow-ups on contract tracing, such efforts have been dwindling.\n\n\u201cThe risks are high for Nigeria, especially with low vaccine coverage, insensitive surveillance system (genomic sequencing in particular), and uncoordinated lab testing. NCDC is charged with coordinating lab activities among other duties. But rather than coordinate, it tends more to controlling and states end up doing what they like,\u201d Tomori said.\n\nAccording to the former vice-chancellor at Redeemer\u2019s University, Ede, while there is no benchmark rate on testing as it depends on the epidemiology of the disease, anything below 10 per cent of the population is poor.\n\nGoing by NCDC data, Nigeria has done slightly over 3.5 million tests, marking 1.6 percent of the population.\n\nAccording to the Africa CDC, a total of around 8.6 million infections have been registered in Africa so far, causing more than 223,000 deaths.\n\nAs of December 1, 52 new confirmed cases and 1 death brought confirmed cases to a total of 214, 270 cases and 2, 978 deaths recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThis, on low ebb, has been fuelling arguments that the COVID-19 pandemic isn\u2019t a real threat to the country\u2019s health systems of economy.\n\nBut Nigeria has experienced three waves of the virus and a fourth wave could be looming if Omicron finds its rhythm in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cOf course, there is a high and great opportunity for the emergence of more variants in environments with low COVID-19 vaccine coverage and disregard for and poor compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Since we do not know how the next variant will behave, this is a delicate situation with possible dire consequences,\u201d Tomori said.\n\nJohn Nkengasong, head of Africa CDC last week expressed concern over the holiday season and fears a sharp increase of COVID-19 numbers due to gatherings over Christmas and New Year.\n\nSeverity profile\n\nThe World Health Organisation on Thursday said it has seen reports of cases of Omicron that go from mild diseases to severe diseases.\n\nThere is also some indication that some of the patients are presenting with mild diseases but again, it\u2019s early days and we do have a surveillance bias right now in terms of the cases being detected.\n\nIn addition, scientists in South Africa tracking the spread of Omicron said Thursday they are seeing a rise in coronavirus reinfections in people who had recovered from COVID-19 as the country reported another sharp daily rise in new cases.\n\nTheir conclusions suggest previous infection provides less protection against the new variant than against earlier versions.\n\nThey also offer a possible explanation of why Omicron has been able to spread so quickly in the country, outpacing even the highly transmissible Delta variant, which is currently dominant in much of the rest of the world.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s biggest private health insurer and other health experts estimate that around 70 percent of the country\u2019s 60 million citizens have already had COVID-19 and hence some immunity against new infection. Omicron appears to be able to evade some of this immunity, giving it an advantage in a population with a high infection rate, the scientists said in a research paper, which hasn\u2019t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",

Ifueko Alufohai, was donated by Access Bank to the state government in support of the unskilled labour force in the state.\n\nConfirming receipt of the grants, beneficiaries who spoke to journalists commended the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led state government for always prioritizing their welfare and bringing succour to widows in the state.\n\nMrs. Agho Florence, a petty trader in Ovia North-East Local Government Area, said the government has continued to prioritize the welfare of widows in the state, taking nuanced steps to alleviate their sufferings.\n\nShe said, \u201cI want to thank Governor Godwin Obaseki for his efforts at improving the livelihoods of Edo people, including widows and other indigent persons in the state.\n\n\u201cThe financial support is quite timely considering that we are going into the festive seasons.

          "text": "The United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, has said brown envelope journalists are ruining Nigeria\u2019s media industry by eroding the public\u2019s trust in the media.\n\nMs Leonard who spoke during a town hall meeting hosted by the Nigerian Guild of Editors on Thursday in Lagos, said a team approach was needed to help improve public trust in the media.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cBrown envelope journalism undermines the public\u2019s trust in the media, erodes journalistic integrity, and defeats the media\u2019s ability to play a transparent oversight role over government actions.\u201d\n\nBrown envelope is generally used to describe a situation where journalists collect money at events or during press conferences to write favourable stories.\n\nAccording to Ms Leonard, one of the challenges that democracies worldwide face is an \u201cunfortunate, pervasive lack of trust in the media.\u201d\n\nShe decried financial inducement of journalists, saying that the \u201cpractice corrodes the institutional position of the media as what we refer to as the \u201cFourth Estate,\u201d or one of our pillars of democracy.\n\nShe urged Nigerian media to leverage their right to press freedom by countering propaganda and disinformation through regular and impartial fact-checking, NAN reported.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador also said access to accurate, unbiased information was critical to democracy.\n\n\u201cIt ensures that citizens make responsible, informed choices rather than acting out of ignorance or misinformation. Information that is publicly accessible to all ensures that elected representatives uphold their oaths of office and carry out the wishes of those who elected them,\u201d the U.S. envoy further noted.\n\nShe noted that the Nigerian media could ensure that citizen voices were heard, which might help reverse voter apathy.\n\n\u201cToo often Nigerian elections are personality-based and lose focus on critical issues such as unemployment, inflation, and lack of health care,\u201d Ms Leonard stressed, adding that the media could hold the candidates accountable for discussing issues.\n\nThe U.S. envoy added that media coverage of elections could encourage more turnout if all outlets focused on the issues that affected the daily lives of constituents.\n\n\u201cPatronage politics, corruption, inequality, and the failure of many democratic governments to deliver for their citizens fuel public and media doubts about the democratic model, causing them to lose hope and accept the status quo as normal,\u201d she stated.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador urged the media to pay attention not just to society\u2019s problems but also to possible solutions.\n\n\u201cWhen you uncover stories that others have tried to hide or deny, inevitably prosecutions follow, and accountability is attained through the voice of the people at the ballot box,\u201d Ms Leonard explained.\n\nAccording to her, most vicious trolls on the internet are shielded by anonymity.\n\nThe ambassador disclosed that the U.S. recently created a new Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy to fight back against disinformation, stand up for internet freedom and reduce the misuse of surveillance technology.\n\n\u201cToo often, technology is being used to silence dissent and prosecute citizens \u2013 and democracies must answer the call to fight back against disinformation, stand up for internet freedom, reduce the misuse of surveillance technology, and establish standards of responsible conduct in cyberspace,\u201d stated Ms Leonard. \u201cDemocracy works at its best where there is a multiplicity of voices from broad segments of society which represent every race, gender and ethnicity addressing a plethora of issues from access to opportunity, health, and prosperity,\u201d according to NAN.",

          "text": "The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has projected Nigeria\u2019s economy to end 2021 with 2.5% growth rate.\n\nLCCI president Mrs Toki Mabogunje disclosed this at the 133rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the chamber on Thursday in Lagos, NAN reported.\n\nThe LCCI chief urged that Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary sides of the economy should promote growth-enhancing and confidence-building policies that would encourage private capital flows to the economy to achieve the growth, and also a medium-term recovery plan anchored on local productivity, ease of business, attracting private investment, and developing physical and soft infrastructure.\n\nMabogunje noted that Nigeria\u2019s inflation would be sustained at its double-digit level in the short to medium term due to persistent food supply shocks, foreign exchange illiquidity, higher energy cost, potential removal of fuel subsidy, insecurity and social unrest in the Northern region.\n\n\u201cThese structural factors will continue to mount pressure on domestic consumer prices,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that despite the non-oil economy growth by 5.4 per cent, insecurity challenges in some parts of the country may cause production to shrink and supply chain to be disrupted.\n\n\u201cKey drivers of the non-oil sector growth were finance and insurance with 23.2 per cent, transport and storage 20.6 per cent, trade with 11.9 per cent, telecommunications 10.9 per cent.\n\n\u201cOthers are manufacturing 4.3 per cent, construction 4.1 per cent, real estate 2.3 per cent as well as agriculture 1.2 per cent all year round.\n\n\u201cHowever, with the worsening security perception about the country, foreign investors are not interested in bringing in Foreign Direct Investments to Nigeria,\u201d Mabogunje said.\n\nOn the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria to retain policy parameters, she said that while the CBN has been keen to extend credit to the real economy as a way of supporting the economy, the fact remains that credit provision in recent times has proved ineffective in boosting output growth and stabilising consumer prices.\n\n\u201cThis is given the weak pass-through effect of traditional monetary policy instruments on the broader economy.\n\n\u201cA broad-based combination of fiscal and monetary policies is imperative to achieving the twin objective of economic growth and price stability.\n\n\u201cLooking forward, factors such as oil prices, oil production, output growth, inflation, foreign exchange stability, foreign capital inflows, credit to the private sector are expected to influence monetary policy.\n\n\u201cThese decisions are decisions in the short to medium term.\n\n\u201cOn the fiscal side, we expect to see clear communications and actions on the proposed fuel subsidy removal and how this will ease government\u2019s revenue and boost investment in infrastructure,\u201d she said",

          "title": "AESID To Umahi: Don\u2019t Drag Oluchukwu Into Effium Crisis",
          "text": "A good governance and accountability group, Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID), has raised the alarm that the Ebonyi State governor, Engr. David Umahi, has wrongly accused and trying to link its President, Amb. Pascal Oluchchukwu, to the recent crisis in Effium community in Ohaukwu local government area of the state.\n\nThe group described the development as \u201cembarrassing, disdainful and threatening disposition\u201d to Oluchukwu by the governor.\n\nAESID said the governor had allegedly in a phone call recently accused Oluchchukwu of being one of the masterminds of attacks which led to the death of some Police officers on investigation duty in the war-torn Effium community.\n\nBut in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday by the secretary of the organisation, Barr. Nnamdi Imeze E., the group demanded \u201can unreserved apology from Governor Umahi within 24 hours and withdrawal of all threats, accusations he allegedly made against Oluchukwu.\n\nThe organisation said following the recent abduction of some construction workers on duty at the Effium section of the Abakaliki ring road and their reported killing by their captors, the Ebonyi state government had dispatched a team of officers from the anti-kidnapping unit of the State\u2019s Police Command who went in search of the victims before they were reportedly ambushed by armed gunmen who shot and killed them including abducting some of the uniformed men.\n\n\u201cWe brutally condemn the recent incidents of renewed attacks and hostilities in Effium since the war between the Effium aborigines of Korri extraction and the their Ezza brothers both of who have always lived in peace and harmony till the recent politically-motivated killings over alleged control of a motor park.\n\n\u201cHowever, AESID is perturbed by the weighty allegations without any iota of credible proof or substance against our leader, Ambassador Paschal Oluchukwu who was recently put on a rather strange call by the Governor, accusing him of being one of the sponsors of the fighter warriors accused of perpetrating the recent attacks on Police men on duty. Governor Umahi is on record as having specifically threatened to petition our revered leader to the Buhari Presidency as a sponsor of the Effium crises.\n\n\u201cThis does not only sound strange to us but a surprising case of attempting to give a dog a bad image in order to hang it! We would consequently wish to raise some few very germane posers and concerns for the Umahi-led administration which AESID believes has failed to better manage the Effium crises with a view to bringing a reasonably enduring solution:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSince this ugly carnage started in January 22, 2021, what really can the Umahi government boast of doing to bring peace? We recall that AESID, just like some other platforms had long called for the removal from office of the Local Government Chairman and other political office holders from the area who has been severally accused of using public funds to hire arms and mercenaries to sustain the tempo of the killings. About 11 months down the line, Odaa and other suspected masterminds of the killings have rather remained not only in office, but still calling the shots on happenings in the now deserted Effium community.\n\n\u201cWhat has the panels set up by the State government accomplished thus far that is known to Ebonyians? Why is it taking nearly eternity for Umahi to be pragmatic in bringing an enduring solution to the crises? Does his biddable posture since the beginning of the crisis not validate claims in certain quarters that his administration is rather fertilizing or giving tacit endorsements to the crisis for some yet-to-be-uncovered political reasons?\n\n\u201cWith thousands successfully displaced from their homes and many still taking shelters in his newly-built Round-Abouts at Ezzamgbo, Abakaliki in the residences of some deeply concerned friends, well-wishers and relatives in various parts of the State, what succour has the Umahi administration really given these distraught victims? Or are there no longer humanitarian and disaster management agencies in the State and at the federal level?\n\n\u201cWhy is it difficult for the Umahi government to take bold steps towards sincerely reaching out to all parties involved in the conflict and rebuilding the destroyed homes, farmlands and other properties worth billions of naira that have been damaged in Effium?\n\n\u201cWhat also happened to the army of security personnel which Umahi claimed on National Televisions to have dispatched to the area to restore peace?\u201d\n\nWhile condemning the phone threat allegedly made by the governor, AESID said without publicity, Oluchukwu had donated cash and other resources to the affected communities.\n\n\u201cHe has as a matter of fact been deeply concerned by the crises that he has given several other supports to the victims and their relatives all buoyed by his very passionate disposition for the plights of Ebonyi people anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cSame should be widely and reasonably publicized in various Nigerian media outlets and copied the various offices he may have contacted or plan to contact for the purposes of accomplishing his voiced evil machinations, which is not only record but being carefully studied by our team of local and international legal experts.\n\n\u201cFailure to do so as demanded within the stated period, AESID vows to make a formal petition against his office and person which would culminate into a proper litigation before some reputable national and international human rights and social justice agencies. Even when he leaves office, we shall stringently demand that he proves his sneering allegations against our leader before the International Criminal Court, ICC, Amnesty International and other justice agencies of repute,\u201d they stated.",

          "text": "The President of the Association of Contractors of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Sylvester Tonye, has disclosed that the federal government was owing NDDC contractors over N2trn for projects executed in the Niger Delta region.\n\nTonye, who spoke while briefing journalists in Abuja on Thursday, emphasised that the federal government must urgently inaugurate a substantive Board for the NDDC to ensure smooth operations.\n\n\u201cYou have an Interim Administrator who does not even come to the office in Port Harcourt. For over two months you will never see him. He is always in Abuja. We want a Board that will sit and be responsible to the people.\n\n\u201cThe Senate has screened the Board already, let them bring them on. The forensic audit was a scam. You can not be on my site and I am not there and you say you are doing a forensic audit. Who does that?,\u201d he queried.\n\nSpeaking on abandoned projects in the Niger Delta region, chairman of the contractors, Joe Adia, said: \u201cthere is no way you will give a project to a man, he will go to source for funds on his own, then when he gets to a milestone, you refuse to pay him for about five years, how does he go back to that project?\n\n\u201cAutomatically the project is abandoned because you refused to play your part as the Commission. The Federal Government does not give enough money to the Commission, but the little that comes is embezzled.\u201d\n\nWhile urging the government to come to their aid urgently, he recalled that during the probe of the NDDC by the National Assembly, the pieces of evidence they presented were swept under the carpet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also lamented that the Interim Management that exists in the NDDC is not adding value to the Commission, that rather it is returning NDDC far beyond where they are coming from.\n\n\u201cWe are saying bring the board so that there will be equity and even distribution of representation in the region. We are the victims. We are the ones that have been owed for over 10 years.\n\n\u201cWe have nine states in the NDDC, but one man is heading NDDC. It is an abnormal activity. We have given them enough time to bring the board, but since they have refused, we have come out to say they must bring the board. It is not a matter of negotiation, they must bring the board as early as yesterday,\u201d he added.",

It is like he was not aware of things before, but now Almighty Allah has enlightened him. Every sane person will be happy. Besides, making such comments in his position ,I know he is serious and deeply concerned about it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf politics reunite us ,it\u2019s good to go.If that couldn\u2019t be ,we should thank Almighty Allah since we\u2019ve made progress. In his thinking, he has explained how the situation is,\u201d he said.\n\nHOW GANDUJE BETRAYED ME\n\nResponding to a question on whether he saw Ganduje\u2019s felicitations on his 65th birthday ,Kwankwaso said he has not seen the birthday felicitations because he was busy doing other things.\n\n\u201cI was busy working, I never know. If he was like that since the beginning ,things wouldn\u2019t have gotten to this level. Whoever knows, no one will believe Ganduje would be castigated before me and I will heed to that. All the commissioners know ,other workers and the Kano people too. There will be problem if someone did a wrong and you decided to look at him as someone who did multiple wrongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a cordial relationship with people including Ganduje ,that was how I left the state government and went to the Ministry of Defence. We arranged and he went to Chad,I then asked him to come back home so that we work together..He came back and I gave him the form for the position of Deputy Governor. I did that because he was the eldest ,without paying a single kobo. This is because in our Kwankwasiyya movement ,we don\u2019t ask for a kobo. \u201c\n\nKwankwaso however ,regretted that despite his kindness to his former Deputy Governor ( Ganduje),they are now at serious loggerheads .

          "text": "Former Governor of Kano state, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, has said that the current crisis brewing in the \u0136ano state chapter of the All Progressives Congress ( APC),did not come to him as a surprise.\n\nSenator Kwankwaso blamed the incumbent Governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, saying his alleged selfish attitude was responsible for the crisis.\n\nKwankwaso told the BBC Hausa in an interview ,that he knew it was just a matter of time that there would be an implosion in the ruling party in Kano state due to series of Internal wranglings.\n\nAccording to him ,\u201d whoever failed to embrace the person who was kind to him over the years, even he, himself has testified that I was kind to him, and when he got the opportunity for once, he could not sustain Kwankwaso and the Kwankwasiyya movement, you should know there won\u2019t be a peaceful coexistence.\u201d\n\nSenator Kwankwaso explained further that the internal crisis in the ruling party was exacerbated by a deep sense of selfishness ,winner takes all attitude and impatience, adding that the development had further gave credence to what he had in mind.\n\nHe likened the situation to a Hausa proverb that can be losely translated as \u201d no matter how far a lie can go, truth must prevail. \u201c\n\nIn the BBC Hausa interview, Kwankwaso said he was delighted with the kind words of a former Governor of the state ,Malam Ibrahim Shekarau who spoke well about him ,pointing out that whoever got such an eulogy would definitely be happy.\n\n\u201cI was told about what he said regarding to me, but I was full of gratitude to Almighty Allah. It is like he was not aware of things before, but now Almighty Allah has enlightened him. Every sane person will be happy. Besides, making such comments in his position ,I know he is serious and deeply concerned about it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf politics reunite us ,it\u2019s good to go.If that couldn\u2019t be ,we should thank Almighty Allah since we\u2019ve made progress. In his thinking, he has explained how the situation is,\u201d he said.\n\nHOW GANDUJE BETRAYED ME\n\nResponding to a question on whether he saw Ganduje\u2019s felicitations on his 65th birthday ,Kwankwaso said he has not seen the birthday felicitations because he was busy doing other things.\n\n\u201cI was busy working, I never know. If he was like that since the beginning ,things wouldn\u2019t have gotten to this level. Whoever knows, no one will believe Ganduje would be castigated before me and I will heed to that. All the commissioners know ,other workers and the Kano people too. There will be problem if someone did a wrong and you decided to look at him as someone who did multiple wrongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a cordial relationship with people including Ganduje ,that was how I left the state government and went to the Ministry of Defence. We arranged and he went to Chad,I then asked him to come back home so that we work together..He came back and I gave him the form for the position of Deputy Governor. I did that because he was the eldest ,without paying a single kobo. This is because in our Kwankwasiyya movement ,we don\u2019t ask for a kobo. \u201c\n\nKwankwaso however ,regretted that despite his kindness to his former Deputy Governor ( Ganduje),they are now at serious loggerheads .

WHO DEY ZUZU!! Just copped my first RR!! God is good! I\u2019m forever grateful to y\u2019all!! \u2764\ufe0f \u2026 oh yea 2021 BTW.\n\nThen in November, he asked his fans and friends to donate money towards the clearing of the car. His target was N100 million. But he ended up raising over N200 million.\n\nThe whole money, along with N50M of his own will now go to orphanages in Nigeria.\n\nAs the whip joins the fleet in his garage, here are some facts about the luxury SUV, produced by Rolls Royce.\n\n1.Rolls Royce Cullinan is the first Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) for all terrains produced by Rolls Royce, makers of limousine-like sedans such as Phantom and Ghost.\n\n2. This mammoth machine gets its name fittingly from a gigantic diamond, considering its overwhelming opulence and ultra-expensive price.\n\n3. Rolls Royce touts the machine capable of gliding over any terrain, whatever challenge the environment presents.\n\n\u201cWherever you dare to go. Handle any adventure with absolute authority in the most capable Rolls-Royce ever created\u201d.\n\n4. A unique aluminium spaceframe underpins Cullinan, along with new Rolls-Royce chassis technology, to deliver the signature Rolls-Royce magic carpet ride. The driving experience is peerless,\n\n5. The back seat feels as spacious as a living room, and the Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament broadcasts the size of the owner\u2019s bank account, says CarandDriver.com.\n\n6. The RR Cullinan is one of the most luxurious SUVs on this planet and sits at the top. It is truly the Rolls-Royce of SUVs with a refinement that can\u2019t be matched\n\n7. The engine bay is filled with a twin-turbo 6.7-liter V12 engine that produces 563 horsepower. The noise from the Cullinan engine is the same as the sound of the tick of a clock.\n\n8. The car can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds.\n\n9. All-wheel drive is standard. It rides on air suspension that receives information from a road-scanning camera and automatically adjusts the vehicle\u2019s height to compensate for the standards of regular luxury vehicles.\n\n10. Standard safety systems in the 2021 Rolls Royce Cullinan include forward-collision warning and automated emergency braking, lane-departure warning and lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control.\n\n11. Rolls Royce Cullinan interior is the same as that of the 2021 Rolls Royce Phantom.\n\n12. The car\u2019s drawback is that it is awkwardly shaped, with some inelegant interior bits. For instance, its regular back seat lacks adjustability.\n\n13.The Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of the 2021 Rolls Royce Cullinan will start from $340,350.\n\n12. The landing price in Nigeria will be above N230,000,000 .\n\n*Qiuick Facts with help from sellatease.com",

          "text": "Lasun Yusuff, a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, claims that the 2018 Osun gubernatorial election was rigged and that the agents involved were suitably compensated with lucrative jobs in the current administration.\n\nYusuff disclosed on a radio current affairs program in Osogbo on Friday that he was not a violent man when he made a statement in Abuja after the acquisition of his gubernatorial nomination forms at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Secretariat in Abuja.\n\nHe stated that by stressing that \u201cno man born of a woman can rig him out in the next election,\u201d he meant that anybody planned to rig the 2022 governor election, which would be a replay of the rigging of the 2018 gubernatorial race, would face God\u2019s judgment.\n\nHe further stated that his speech was a warning to politicians not to be a nuisance or criminal, and that any act of rigging would result in the offenders being hunted down.\n\nThe former Deputy Speaker, who claimed the 2018 Osun gubernatorial election was rigged, said the processes up to the rerun, as well as President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s claim that the election was remotely controlled, were all indicators that the APC did not win the race fairly.\n\nHe encouraged anyone who wished to question him on his claim to do so, but warned that doing so would lead to the party\u2019s demise.\n\nThe Ilobu politician added that he gets along well with both Rauf Aregbesola, the state\u2019s former governor, and Adegboyega Oyetola, the current governor.\n\nIn his words, \u201cRauf Aregbesola did well in claiming Osun for the progressives having led from the frontline. He is three things to me; he is my elder brother, friend and confidant.\n\n\u201cWhen I wanted to contest as Deputy Speaker, he called me and told me he may not support me on that but while I wanted to contest the 2018 Osun gubernatorial election, he did not say anything to me. At first, I held it against him but as for now, it is all in the past.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Adegboyega Oyetola had a meeting with me, I told him to go round, meet the people and address aggrieved members of the party.

These include MOUs on Military Cooperation, Power, Cooperation in the field of Geology, Mining, and Mineral Processing, Oil and Gas and several others.\n\n\u201dToday, we also jointly launched the Nigeria-South Africa Youth Dialogue, another veritable tool for interaction among our youth with the aim of creating shared values and aspiration. Many of our youth, from Nigeria and South Africa joined us virtually during the launch,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked his colleague for initiating the Youth Dialogue, noting that continuous interaction between the youth of the two countries would further break barriers and suspicion among our people.\n\nHe added that the inauguration of the Joint Ministerial Advisory Council on Industry, Trade and Investment, would enable the private sectors of the two largest economies in Africa to further promote economic cooperation and development.\n\n\u201dWe appreciate that we need to do much more to achieve further integration of our two economies and take full advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\n\u201dOnce again, I wish to thank my brother President and members of the South African delegation for their visit and their wonderful friendship, cooperation and solidarity,\u201d he said.\n\nRamaphosa\n\nIn his remarks, President Ramaphosa thanked the leaders of Nigeria, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal for expressing their dissatisfaction with the travel ban imposed on South Africa and sister neighbouring countries in the aftermath of the discovery of the Omicron COVID-19 variant by South African scientists.\n\nHe described the imposition of the ban by some western countries as arbitrary, discriminatory, unscientific and unproductive in the long run.\n\n\u201dThis is a global pandemic and overcoming it requires that we collaborate and work together as a collective.\n\n\u201dThe resulting damage to this travel ban to the economies of the countries affected will be considerable and long lasting.\n\n\u201dSo I want to use this opportunity to tell the countries that have imposed this ban to reverse their decisions whether they are the northern more developed economies or in other parts of our continent or elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\n3 Omicron variant, 105 COVID-19 cases\n\nMeanwhile, The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Wednesday announced fresh 105 COVID-19 infections just as Nigeria joined the growing list of countries that have recorded the new Omicron variant with the detection of 3 cases in the country.\n\nThe agency stated this in its daily report in Abuja.\n\nThe 105 additional cases, NCDC said, is an increase from the 21 cases reported in the country the previous day, warning that Nigeria was at the risk of registering high incidences of the new variant due to neglect of preventive measures at airports and other points of entry in the country.\n\nThe latest additional cases which were recorded in 8 states and the FCT, showed the country now had a total of 214,218 COVID-19 confirmed cases.\n\nIt listed the states that recorded the new COVID-19 cases to include Lagos (43), Gombe (21), FCT (16), Niger (10), Rivers (6), Plateau (5), Edo (2), Bauchi (1), and Kano (1).\n\nThe NCDC said 12 people had recovered from the infection as at Tuesday, while the total number of discharged cases now stood at 207,304 nationwide.",

          "text": "\u2026Says challenges undermining national unity can no longer be ignored\n\nThe immediate past chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega, has called on elected leaders at all levels to address the smouldering crisis arising from regional agitations across Nigeria to safeguard the unity of the country.\n\nHe specifically enjoined the leaders to consciously promote and uphold the rule of law in order to engender peace and harmony.\n\nAccording to him, national unity in a diverse country like Nigeria is not easy to attain due to what he called \u201cethno-linguistic differences, social and religious identities, which ordinarily foster and bolster prejudice and obstinacy, which are susceptible to mobilisation and manipulation by ethno-religious elite.\u201d\n\nProfessor Jega spoke in a keynote address at the National Unity Summit 2021, entitled Nigeria: \u201cThe Imperative of Unity\u201d organised by the National Prosperity Movement (NPM) Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nThe former INEC boss said the tensions that sparked off agitations across the country were linked to crises of inequality, marginalisation and outright denial of citizens\u2019 rights to harmonious co-existence among others.\n\nHe also fingered at \u201cincompetent and parochial leaders\u201d for the surge of regional and sectional violence and security challenges across the country, saying \u201cnational unity has to be deliberately forged, nurtured and entrenched through citizenship mobilization, sensitisation and education, as well as through policies and programmes for actualising the goal of unity in diversity and national integration.\u201d\n\nThe former university vice chancellor highlighted the major threats to national unity to include; negative mobilisation of ethno-religious and other primordial identities, especially in contestations for power in electoral politics, hate speeches targeted at perceived \u2018others\u2019, in an \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them\u2019 categorisations, reckless peddling of misinformation, giving primacy to \u2018indigenes\u2019 over \u2018citizenship\u2019 rights in state and local governance, Boko Haram insurgency, and irredentist militancy in the South-east and South-south among others.\n\n\u201cThere is in present day Nigeria evidence of remarkable erosion of national unity and seeming whittling down if not abandonment of yester-years lofty projects of national integration. The resurgence of, and violent activism by, insurgents and irredentist militants with a clear agenda for dismemberment of Nigeria, is indicative of the sorry state of national unity.\n\n\u201cSo is the increasingly indifferent and apathetic disposition of teeming youth with regards to serious national affairs, which ordinarily would require their active engagement. Indeed, many young men and women are frustrated that they are diverting their energies to aggressive behaviour and creativity to all sorts of criminality. Some have even given up on Nigeria and are merely looking for opportunities to \u2018check-out\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis situation needs to be effectively and decisively addressed. The imperative of national unity is of such importance that the challenges undermining it can no longer be ignored, and all hands need to, have to, be on deck to find lasting solutions to them.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Director General of the National Prosperity Movement, Ahmad Sajoh said NPM\u2019s conviction for organising the summit was predicated on the belief that, as a society, Nigerians were greater than the challenges confronting them.\n\nThose who graced the summit included Ekiti state Governor Dr Kayode Fayemi and General IBM Haruna, who was chairman of the occasion, among several others.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), on Thursday confirmed that three telecoms operators submitted their Expression of Interest (EoI) to the commission to bid for the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, whose auction date has been fixed for December 13, 2021.\n\nThe NCC in a statement signed by its Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, disclosed that it received their applications to bid for the spectrum.\n\nAdinde also said the three bidders met all criteria, including the payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM), which pegged the initial deposit at 10 per cent of the reserved bid price of $197.4 million (N75 billion).\n\nHe said the NCC had already fixed December 10 for a mandatory mock bidding, ahead of the main bidding process that will hold December 13, 2021.\n\nThe three bidders are MTN Nigeria Plc, Airtel Networks Limited and Mafab Communications Limited. All three bidders paid N7.5 billion each as non-refundable initial deposit, which is 10 per cent of the reserved bid price.\n\nAlthough Mafab Communications is not known in the Nigerian telecoms space, THISDAY gathered that it is a new entrant and a strategic investor with a non-mobile licence that is investing in one of the small telecoms operators in Nigeria.\n\nThe NCC stated: \u201cConsistent with its regulatory principle of open and transparent auction, the NCC has announced that three telecoms companies have qualified as approved bidders of the forthcoming 3.5 gigahertz (Ghz) spectrum auction for the deployment of Fifth generation (5G) networks in the country.\n\n\u201cThe qualified bidders that have met the criteria for participation in the licensing process of 3.5Ghz spectrum, including payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM), are MTN Nigeria Plc, Mafab Communications Limited and Airtel Networks Limited.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the stage is now set for the three companies to participate in the main auction as well as in the mandatory Mock Auction process, which will come as a precursor to the main auction.\u201d\n\nThe commission has also reaffirmed the dates for the conduct of both the mock auction and the main auction. The mock auction was scheduled to hold on Friday, December 10, 2021 at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, while the main auction will hold on Monday, December 13, 2021 at same venue and same time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management of the Nigerian NCC, Mr. Adeleke Adewolu, has expressed the commission\u2019s readiness to launch the 5G network in 2022.\n\nAdewolu who made this known in his speech yesterday, at the agency stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum held in Port Harcourt, stated that the recent engagement of the stakeholders was, \u201cto formally commence efforts towards the launch of 5G networks,, next year.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cThis would enable Nigerians enjoy cutting-edge technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing; Quantum Computing, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the forum titled, \u201cTalk to the Regulator,\u201d Adewolu said it was held at a crucial point in the evolution of the telecoms sector, not just in Nigeria, but globally.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe NCC is currently leading the industry to facilitate the rollout of broadband infrastructure so that Nigeria can achieve the target of 70 per cent broadband penetration to at least 90 per cent of the population by 2025 as articulated in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP 2020-2025).\u201d\n\nAdewolu added that NCC was assisting to put in place critical supporting infrastructure that would facilitate Nigeria\u2019s emergence as a truly digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to develop a comprehensive national citizens\u2019 identity database on which every other sector of the economy which requires citizen identification can leverage,\u201d Adewolu disclosed.\n\nHowever, in his keynote speech, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, stated that the objective of the programme with the theme: \u201cImproving Stakeholders Satisfaction,\u201d was embedded in the NCC\u2019s Strategic Vision Plan (SVP 2021-2025).\u201d\n\nDanbatta listed the vision as, \u201cOrganisational renewal for operational efficiency and regulatory excellence, facilitate the provision of infrastructure for a digital economy which fosters national development.\u201d\n\nAlso, it \u201cpromotes fair competition, inclusive growth, increased investment and innovative services, and facilitate strategic collaboration and partnership.\u201d\n\nRepresented by Adewolu, the NCC Vice Chairman disclosed that such stakeholders\u2019 gathering was earlier held in Kano for the north and Lagos for the south-west, saying the Port Harcourt session was for the south-south and south-east regions.\n\nHe noted that the successes achieved by the industry were because the commission put stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction at the centre of her activities.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo sustain past achievements and reach new heights, we need all our stakeholders, particularly our licensees, to be fully on board. We need you to key into our programmes and to operate with maximum efficiency.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his remarks, the Director, Licencing and Authorisation Department, NCC, Mr. Mohammed Babajika, stressed that despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its resultant challenges, the Commission is further liberalising the Telecoms industry finalising the framework for Mobile Virtual Network Operator and currently reviewing existing regulations.\n\nSome of the stakeholders that spoke with THISDAY at the forum were Doreen Ekeh, Retail manager for the Port Harcourt branch of Airtel Network and Emmanuel Aneke with Smile Network. They commended the NCC for its commitment to the industry.\n\nEmma Okonji in Lagos and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",

          "title": "Despite Emergency Oil Releases, Omicron Fears, OPEC Sticks to 400,000bpd Supply Hike",
          "text": "Despite concerns over the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, and recent emergency oil reserves releases by a United States-led coalition, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ Thursday resolved to stick with its current production policy of 400,000 bpd monthly increases in January.\n\nThe decision came as a surprise to market watchers who were expecting the producers\u2019 group to temporarily halt the July 2021 agreement to tame the expected oversupply from the first quarter of 2022, owing to the added threat of renewed lockdown by some nations.\n\nA number of analysts had expected the group to pause its monthly increase next month in light of the upcoming strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) release by key crude buyers and the recent emergence of Omicron, a potentially more transmissible Covid-19 strain.\n\nIn July, OPEC+ had agreed on a roadmap to restore all of the production it removed from the market in May last year in response to the Covid-19-induced collapse in oil demand.\n\nThe roadmap entailed a 400,000bpd increase in the group\u2019s collective quota every month through to April next year, followed by a rise of 432,000 bpd each month until all of the original cut is unwound.\n\nThe increases must be rubber-stamped at monthly ministerial meetings and can be paused for up to three months if market conditions warrant it.\n\nThe group also agreed to a six-month extension to the deadline for its compensation scheme which imposes additional cuts for countries that produce above target to the end of June 2022.\n\nIn reaction, oil prices were largely bearish for the rest of the day. Specifically, Brent crude, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, was $1.21, or 1.7 per cent lower at $67.66 a barrel as of Thursday afternoon, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.24, or 1.8 per cent, to $64.33.\n\nGlobal oil prices have lost more than $10 a barrel since last Thursday, when news of Omicron first shook investors, but OPEC and its allies insisted on releasing more oil into the market next month in line with previous months.\n\nAlso weighing on the market was weekly US inventory data showing that US crude stocks fell less than expected last week, while petrol and distillate inventories rose much more than expected while demand weakened.\n\nA statement released after meeting stated: \u201cThe 23rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), was held via videoconference, on Thursday December 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe meeting reaffirmed the continued commitment of the participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to ensure a stable and balanced oil market.\n\n\u201cIn view of current oil market fundamentals, the meeting resolved to reaffirm the decision of the 10th ONOMM on April 12, 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings including the 19th ONOMM on July 18, 2021.\n\n\u201cIt reconfirmed the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th ONOMM and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of January 2022.\n\n\u201cIt agreed that the meeting shall remain in session pending further developments of the pandemic and continue to monitor the market closely and make immediate adjustments if required.\u201d\n\nOPEC noted that it was extending the compensation period until the end of June 2022 as requested by some underperforming countries and requested that they submit their plans by December 17, 2021.\n\n\u201cCompensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th ONOMM,\u201d it added.\n\nWhile reiterating the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism, the organisation resolved to hold the 24th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting on January 4, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria has received a production output allocation of 1.683 million bpd for January, in spite of its inability to meet previous quotas.\n\nThe country has been lagging in its capacity to produce enough as a result of ageing upstream infrastructure, sabotage and oil theft as well as difficulty in restarting the oil wells that were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently assured that by the end of the year, Nigeria would be able to ramp up its production to at least 1.7 million bpd.\n\nDespite the over 1.6 million bpd allocated to Nigeria in September and October, the country was only to supply 1.399 million bpd and 1.354 million barrels in the two separate months.\n\nKyari argued that although Nigeria has faltered in meeting its OPEC allocation, by the end of the year, the country may be able to hit 1.8 million bpd, excluding condensates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that by the close of the year, we will get back to the 1.7 barrels to 1.8 barrels per day of crude oil. When I mention this figure, I am only talking about crude oil because we also produce condensates and when you combine, we can easily hit 2.0 million barrels by the end of the year,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe GMD reiterated that Nigeria was hugely impacted by its inability to restart the oil facilities after the Covid-19-induced shutdowns, emphasising that with the fresh clarity around the fiscal environment with the introduction of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), more investments were being expected in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear, during the covid-19 pandemic, we shut down some of these wells and they usually don\u2019t come back as early as we want them. Right now, we do have some challenges around the facilities and these are being taken care of. There\u2019s enormous work going on that will get us back before the end of the year,\u201d he stated.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

Be rest assured, whenever you walk, we will walk with you. We will be by your side. Whenever you run, we will run with you to the end,\u201d Badmus assured on behalf of LASU students.\n\nSanwo-Olu who had the first session with the Students Representatives Council, charged the students to join hands with the state government and LASU management for the institution to make it competitive among notable universities in the world.\n\nSanwo-Olu during the sitting announced a donation of two brand new big buses to the SUG to ease movement around the campus as well as other gadgets and equipment for students\u2019 use.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to tell you that we are in this journey together and together, we will build the biggest university in the whole of Africa and it will compete with the greatest universities in the entire world.\n\n\u201cI feel highly honoured that all of you have turned out in large numbers to come and see the possibilities of what we can do collectively.\n\n\u201cThis arcade will provide the right atmosphere for the leadership of the Student Union of LASU and opportunity for students\u2019 management better relationship. It would provide an opportunity to engage with the wonderful youths in LASU, because this is also a building to develop the future leaders that are leaders here today.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Awosanya who is currently in London, said he would join Governor Sanwo-Olu for the Peace Walk if he is Nigeria at the time of the exercise, saying he is more concerned about a peaceful society.\n\n\u201cBecause I am an advocate for peace, justice, equity and fairness, I will walk with anybody who wants peace,\u201d Awosanya, popularly known as Segalink said during an interview on Channels Television.\n\nAwosanya said the Sanwo-Olu-led administration was doing everything possible to ensure peace in Lagos, adding that the government should be encouraged for a peaceful society.\n\nHe said the decision of Lagos State Government based on its White Paper to accept 11 recommendations, reject one, accepted six with modifications and forwarded 14 to the Federal Government for consideration out of the 32 recommendations made by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry, was a good development that should be encouraged.\n\nAwosanya said, \u201cinjustice is what we should insist must be corrected\u201d and going by the White Paper released by the Lagos State Government, some of the issues raised in the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry have been addressed.\n\nHe said the decision of the Lagos State Government to forward to the federal government, the recommendation of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry that October 20 should be made a national day was commendable.\n\nAwosanya, who started the #EndSARS online, also advised that those dissatisfied with the Lagos State Government\u2019s White Paper should approach the court to express their grievances against the government decision.\n\nAlso speaking during the programme, a Constitutional lawyer, Mr. Wahab Shittu, said the White Paper released by Lagos State Government was commendable because it showed the state government only rejected only one out of the 32 recommendations made by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry.\n\nHe said the claim by the White Paper in respect to the deceased at the tollgate as against the the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry is in order because evidence can only be based on facts.\n\nSegun James",

          "text": "The Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) on Wednesday announced the immediate suspension of all tournaments in China due to concerns about the well-being of former doubles world number one Peng Shuai and the safety of other players.\n\n\u2018SERIOUS DOUBTS\u2019\n\nPeng did appear in mid-November at a dinner with friends and a children\u2019s tennis tournament in Beijing, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media and by the tournament\u2019s organisers showed.\n\nOn Nov. 21, IOC President Thomas Bach had a 30-minute video call with Peng, who competed at three Olympics, during which she told him she was safe.\n\nBut Simon, who said the decision to suspend tournaments in China had the full support of the WTA Board of Directors, said they were not convinced all was well with Peng.\n\n\u201cWhile we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe, and not subject to censorship, coercion, and intimidation,\u201d said Simon.\n\n\u201cThe WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation \u2013 without censorship \u2013 into Peng Shuai\u2019s sexual assault accusation.\u201d\n\nSimon said the Peng situation demanded a response.\n\n\u201cIf powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded \u2013 equality for women \u2013 would suffer an immense setback. I will not and cannot let that happen,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY\u2019\n\nTennis great and founder of the WTA Billie Jean King was among those who applauded the announcement. read more\n\n\u201cThe WTA has chosen to be on the right side of history in defending the rights of our players,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cThis is yet another reason why women\u2019s tennis is the leader in women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\nMartina Navratilova also signalled her support on Twitter, suggesting the IOC \u201ctake note\u201d.\n\nMen\u2019s world number one Novak Djokovic, who recently co-founded a players\u2019 union aiming to represent both male and female professionals, also backed the move.\n\n\u201cI support fully WTA\u2019s stance because we don\u2019t have enough information about Shuai Peng and her well-being,\u201d the Serbian said after a Davis Cup tie in Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s life of a tennis player that is in question here, so we, as the tennis community, need to stand together.\u201d\n\nThe United States Tennis Association commended the WTA.\n\n\u201cThis type of leadership is courageous and what is needed to ensure the rights of all individuals are protected and all voices are heard,\u201d the body said in a statement.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) and men\u2019s Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to Cuba, Ma Hui, responded on Twitter with a single word.\n\n\u201cPosturing?\u201d he wrote.\n\nAGGRESSIVE EXPANSION\n\nSimon had previously said the WTA would shut down its operations in China if it was not satisfied with the response to the allegations.\n\nThe WTA began an aggressive expansion into China on the eve of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and local interest in the sport was fuelled by Li Na winning the 2011 French Open.\n\nChina hosted just two WTA events in 2008 but 11 years later was staging nine, including the WTA Tour finals which were secured in a 10-year deal by the city of Shenzhen in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, the WTA announced a 10-year digital rights deal with Chinese streaming platform iQiyi reportedly worth $120 million.\n\nThe pandemic forced the cancellation of all but one of the WTA events in China in 2020 and 2021, including this year\u2019s Tour Finals which were moved to Mexico.\n\nThe 2022 tour calendar has not yet been published.\n\n\u201cUnless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China,\u201d Simon said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s leaders have left the WTA with no choice. I remain hopeful that our pleas will be heard and the Chinese authorities will take steps to legitimately address this issue.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-headquartered tour\u2019s decision to walk away from one of its biggest markets was applauded by many leading figures in the tennis world but could cost the WTA hundreds of millions of dollars in broadcasting and sponsorship revenue.\n\nPeng\u2019s whereabouts became a matter of international concern following a nearly three-week public absence after she posted a message on social media in early November, alleging that China\u2019s former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.\n\nNeither Zhang, who retired in 2018, nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng\u2019s allegation and the topic has been blocked from direct discussion on China\u2019s heavily censored internet. read more\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how I can ask our athletes to compete there when Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely and has seemingly been pressured to contradict her allegation of sexual assault,\u201d WTA chief executive Steve Simon said in a statement.\n\n\u201cGiven the current state of affairs, I am also greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment and calls to the organisers of the China Open tournament went unanswered.\n\nThe ministry said late last month that \u201ccertain people\u201d should stop the \u201cmalicious hyping\u201d and \u201cpoliticization\u201d of the Peng issue. read more\n\nThe decision comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics over China\u2019s human rights record.\n\n\u2018SERIOUS DOUBTS\u2019\n\nPeng did appear in mid-November at a dinner with friends and a children\u2019s tennis tournament in Beijing, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media and by the tournament\u2019s organisers showed.\n\nOn Nov. 21, IOC President Thomas Bach had a 30-minute video call with Peng, who competed at three Olympics, during which she told him she was safe.\n\nBut Simon, who said the decision to suspend tournaments in China had the full support of the WTA Board of Directors, said they were not convinced all was well with Peng.\n\n\u201cWhile we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe, and not subject to censorship, coercion, and intimidation,\u201d said Simon.\n\n\u201cThe WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation \u2013 without censorship \u2013 into Peng Shuai\u2019s sexual assault accusation.\u201d\n\nSimon said the Peng situation demanded a response.\n\n\u201cIf powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded \u2013 equality for women \u2013 would suffer an immense setback.
