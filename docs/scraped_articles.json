If money can buy the president, former President Goodluck Jonathan could have bought the presidential seat in 2015.\n\n\u201cI urge President Muhammadu Buhari, to consider giving Nigeria a man who can give the entire country a sense of belonging, fix our economy, secure all parts of the country, take education very seriously and protect his legacy.\n\n\u201cThe man Nigerians can trust is Senator Ahmad Lawan. Picking Ahmad Lawan as the consensus candidate of the APC will heal and stabilize the country as it is the closest to equity, justice, and fairness.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that the fairness Nigerians need is to produce a president from the South East of Nigeria. In the absence of the South East, it is the North East.\n\n\u201cThese two regions are the only ones yet to produce the president of Nigeria and since the opposition has gone North East, it is ideal and wise that the APC go North East.\n\n\u201cI am sure Nigerians will not waste their votes on any candidate that is not from the two regions in the next year\u2019s general elections and following years\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\nRead Also:\n\nBarbarians, bandits, gunmen determining the fate of Nigeria\n\nFG\u2019s funding behind MCO\u2019s emergence as Winner of NiRA\u2019s 2022 Award \u2014 Adegbite\n\nBelgium\u2019s proposed collaboration with Nigeria\u2019ll galvanize solid minerals production \u2014 Adegbite\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cAs I welcome you all, I would like to state a Declaration of Cooperation that: \u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nThe President added that, \u201cWe must strive to remain committed to our joint statements in the Declaration of Cooperation and ensure continuity. This is beyond attaining short-term demand-supply balancing, while it calls for strengthening our cooperation through a dynamic and transparent framework for sustainable development in the medium to long term.\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Patrick Gush spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector.\n\nGupta said: \u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHe also disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Kudini Village in Kadarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and has employed over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Okowa has also played critical roles for the PDP at different times by delivering credible, rancor-free conventions.\n\n\u201cAt this time that Nigeria earnestly desires a unifier and nationalist, Okowa comes in handy as we can see the peace that he has wrought in Delta state by actively engaging the youths of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident that given his outstanding performance in Delta, where he has connected with the people through infrastructure development, reliable healthcare delivery, quality education, restoration of the state\u2019s sporting glory, youth empowered with diverse skill acquisition programmes and general human capital development, he would add real value to governance at the centre.\n\n\u201cWe want to use this opportunity to caution all those scheming against and blackmailing Okowa to desist from their evil shenanigans as this will not in any way diminish the rising profile of Governor Okowa as a performing governor, a refined democrat and an icon of good governance,\u201d the group said.",

          "text": "From Wilfred Eya and Romanus Ugwu\n\nA few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), indications have emerged that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s bid to determine his successor has split the ranks of the ruling party and rattled the camps of various aspirants.\n\nThis comes as a meeting of the APC governors held in Abuja, yesterday, to deliberate on who to support as the party\u2019s presidential aspirant ended without any resolution.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe president had on Tuesday at a meeting with APC\u2019s 22 governors and National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, appealed that he be accorded the privilege of picking his successor.\n\nIn what appeared like a task to the governors, the president told them before traveling to Spain that he would expect reciprocity from his support to them in their choice of successors in their respective states. He urged them to work together to look for a successor that would carry on his vision for the country.\n\nHowever when the governors met, yesterday, opinions were divided over the essence of their meeting as some of the governors expressed lack of hope in whatever choice they come up with. Those who argued this way said it looked like the president had his mind set on his choice and it would be waste of time coming up with any candidate for him.\n\nOne of the governors was said to have said any choices presented to the president would amount you mere formality. It was gathered that after much deliberation, the governors said they would better pick two choices and submit their names to the president.\n\nIt was learnt that the governors agreed that they would suggest one person from the South and another from the North out of which the President would be asked to make his choice.\n\nHowever, multiple sources told Daily Sun that the president\u2019s stance has thrown the camps of most of presidential aspirants into confusion and also split the party.\n\nIt was also learnt that those opposed to the president have expressed the fear that what guarantees victory for political parties is not just who the candidates are, but the process through which they emerge. And that if the process is flawed so much as to leave members disenchanted, the APC was already on its way to losing the election.\n\nOne of our sources said: \u201cThe camps of many aspirants have become jittery and currently in disarray over the president comments. From the body language of the president and his recent comment, the primaries would be a mere formality. He was clear that having produced their successors or having won their second terms for those who were only completing their first term that it was only fair for them also to allow him produce his successor. Many of the aspirants especially the frontline ones are already having sleepless nights especially when they recall what happened during the APC national chairmanship primaries.\u201d\n\nThis comes as a group, APC National Stakeholders criticised the president\u2019s plan and warned it would amount to imposition and foreclosure of chances for a free and fair contest at the primary.\n\nIts convener, Aliyu Audu, at a press conference in Abuja, said while they recognise the inalienable rights of the President to be interested in whoever succeeds him, it was important that his desire does not negate the need to democratically elect a candidate who reflects all the values and virtues of the party and has the potential to defeat the candidates of other political parties in the 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cWe say this because the memories of what transpired at the last national convention of the party where the president picked his choice for the position of the national chairman and literally forced the other aspirants to step down in a manner that can best be described as an imposition is still very fresh\u2026.If he is influenced by what is obtainable at the states where governors brazenly handpick aspirants at different elections, then it is imperative to remind the president that he is supposed to be the moral compass for us as members of the party and Nigerians as a whole. As the president and leader of the party, it is a moral responsibility that he set examples for the governors and future elected leaders to emulate and not the other way round.\n\n\u201cThe best legacy president Buhari can leave for the APC and Nigeria as a whole is the legacy of a deeply entrenched democratic process where Nigerians can freely choose who represents them at whatever level in free, fair, credible and transparent processes.\n\n\u201cThis legacy must manifest from the APC which prides itself as a party with progressives ideals different from the other stocks. If the so-called \u2018established internal policies\u2019 of succession in the party fulfils all democratic criteria, we would not be having as much crisis in the party as we have witnessed in recent times.\u201d\n\nAlso, a member of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC), Salihu Moh Lukman, while rejecting Buhari\u2019s appeal to the governors, described it as undemocratic.\n\nIn an open letter to the president titled: \u2018Succession and 2023 APC presidential candidate\u2019, Lukman enumerated the dangers and implications of taking such unilateral decision on the party.\n\nHe reminded Buhari on the need to replicate the process that ensured his emergence in 2015 in the selection of the party\u2019s flag bearer for the 2023 poll.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cAs a party, APC must be able to demonstrate much more sensitivity to the challenges of national unity by ensuring that the eventual standard bearer for the 2023 presidential election embodies commitment to equity and justice as the underlying principles sustaining the corporate existence of Nigeria as a united country.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about representation in terms of where the candidate comes from, but mainly about the negotiation framework leading to the eventual selection of the candidate. In the case of the PDP, negotiation was limited to monetary transactions with the less than 1,000 delegates who eventually elected Atiku Abubakar as the Presidential candidate of the PDP. With all the limitation imposed by the current Electoral Act, the delegates at the APC Convention who will be electing our Presidential candidate will not be less than 4,000. For a party with more than 40 million members, this is a far cry and will be weak in terms of being democratically accountable in terms of decisions of delegates reflecting expectations party members. Once the choice of delegates correlates with expectations of over 40 million party members, invariably, it will most likely equate with the expectations of majority of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and one of the presidential aspirants, asked the APC delegates to put monetary incentives aside and elect a standard bearer who does not have baggage.\n\nIn a letter addressed to APC delegates, yesterday, he said they should put the country first in their choice.\n\nThe senate president said the delegates should vote for him so he could become the presidential candidate of the ruling party and deliver good governance if elected.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nDirector, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, who made the clarification in a statement, yesterday, said that given the professional disposition and zero tolerance for any misconduct in the Nigerian Army, the service would take the weighty allegation seriously and approach the prelate and the Methodist church to unravel the basis for the allegation.\n\nHe said while the army sympathised with the prelate and other kidnapped members of the church and shared in their pains, the insinuation that troops were complicit in the kidnap incident was not entirely premised on any findings of investigations and, therefore, could not be swallowed hook line and sinker.\n\nNwachukwu, while noting that the incident was never reported to the nearest army unit in the area when it occurred, said that the Methodist Church did not take the army into confidence while negotiating the ransom with the kidnappers.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo formal complaint has been received by the unit. More worrisome is the fact that it was alleged that the ransom was paid in less than 24 hours. Was the ransom paid to troops? These are questions that beg for answers.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cGiven the spate of insecurity in the region, the question would be, was the issue reported to the unit covering the area? Did the Methodist Church take the NA into confidence while negotiating the ransom with the kidnappers? No formal complaint has been received by the unit.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the NA unit has not received any debrief from the Prelate or the Methodist Church.\n\nIt is, therefore, important to state that troops are deployed at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Okigwe and in front of the Abia State University Uturu, and no information was made available to them or to 14 Brigade or any other formation, except the information making the rounds in the social media.\n\n\u201cIt must be clarified that troops\u2019 deployment in the Nigerian Army is not done with considerations for ethnic affiliation, hence, a deployment of troops of Fulani ethnic extraction, who, as alleged by the prelate, carried out the dastardly act is not our practice or modus operandi in the NA.\n\n\u201cGiven our professional disposition and zero tolerance for any misconduct in the Nigerian Army, we will take this weighty allegation seriously and approach the prelate and the Methodist church to unravel the basis for the allegation.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Kalu is truly a detribalised Nigerian and a powerful political leader with high leadership qualities. Lawan is now discussed in international fora courtesy of Kalu. Despite the fact that Lawan was the last aspirant to pick nomination form, Kalu was able to energize his campaign and bring him to the front row and that is very commendable.\n\n\u201cLawan\u2019s family should know they have a family in Kalu. It is not easy for a man of his status to drop his presidential ambition for another . His action has taught Nigerians a lot . I have personal love for Kalu because he has swag . He stands on his conviction. The Igbo People will get what they are looking for easily if the Igbo people follow him. He has proven to be there for the Senate President at a time he needed him most. He should be commended by every well meaning Nigerian for standing firm on the principles of equity,justice and fairness; for pushing for the support of the North East after the South East couldn\u2019t clinch it.

I have also told Nigerians that I would only run for president if the two major political parties (APC and PDP) zone their tickets to the South East. That is why I was disappointed with our southern brothers who are talking about fairness and equity but have zero tolerance for the same fairness and equity in the South .\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a South Easterner being president of Nigeria in 2023, I have my full support for a North Easterner. This is because it would be the closest to the equity, fairness and justice everyone is talking about. It further means that the justice is on its way to the South East. I thank those who said they have picked presidential form for me because they meant well for Nigerians. However, since there is no zoning and the contest is open to all Nigerians, I officially withdraw from presidential contest in 2023. I have also picked ticket to run for Abia North Senatorial zone and to complete the good work I started in Abia North.\u201d\n\nKalu later congratulated Lawan for picking the nomination form of the APC, and urged all his allies to support the presidential bid of Lawan.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022Okays $968,818 for emergency restoration of Lagos power line\n\n\u2022Moves to address rising food prices\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nThe federal government has explained why the $3.1 billion contract for complete automation of the Nigeria Custom Service (NCS) approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in 2020 was reversed.\n\nIt said disagreement among partners that formed consortium for the project delayed its take off despite efforts by the government through the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to mediate.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, who spoke to newsmen yesterday, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, explained the rationale behind a new e-Customs concession agreement between the NCS, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Limited.\n\nAccording to the minister: \u201cThe e-Customs project was approved by Council. And there were some challenges that had to do with disagreements among the concession partners.\n\n\u201cRemember that government was not a partner of the concession, it was a group of different investing parties that came together and formed the consortium.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice has intervened. There were several number of meetings to try to iron out the difference. So it has to do with shareholders, who has what responsibility. And at the end of the day, I think one of the partners in the concession did not agree with the arrangements.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cSo the partner that signed was already in the initial concession. So that one party did not agree with the terms that are signed. And there is a new agreement that had been signed and that partner was reported to have opted out of the concession.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the report yet but it was reported to have opted out of being in the concession. So there is a new concession agreement that has been committed. And on the part of the ministry and I know Custom, what it means is that the implementation of e-Customs project can now start with this resolution.\u201d\n\nThe NCS Comptroller-General, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd) who signed the new contract in Abuja, Monday, had explained that the NCS would generate a whopping revenue of $176 billion over the next 20 years through the implementation of e-customs project.\n\nAli reportedly said the e-Customs concession project would ease the cost of doing business, boost revenue, enhance productivity and stop every arbitrariness in the service.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe $3.2 billion e-Customs project to be financed by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and managed by Huawei Technologies Limited under a 20-year concession window, when fully implemented, would quadruple Customs\u2019 current N210 billion monthly revenue collection.\u201d\n\nThe project which was approved by FEC on September 2, 2020, and awarded to Messrs E. Customs HC Project Limited, was expected to last for 36 months, to enhance the agency\u2019s mode of operation using the application of information and technology in all aspects of its administration.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of this project is to completely automate every aspect of the customs business and to institutionalise the use of smart and emerging technologies that will enhanced the statutory function of the Nigerian Customs Service in the areas of revenue generation as well as trade facilitation and enhancement of security,\u201d the Minister of Finance and Budget Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had told State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting in 2020.\n\nAlso, Ahmed disclosed plan by the federal government to address rising cost food prices across the country as it plans to convene a meeting of the National Food Security Council shortly.\n\nShe also disclosed that that FEC gave approval for the National Food Security Council to meet, \u201cvery quickly to address the issue of food inflation, and also provide a plan and some methods in which we can reduce the cost of food to support improved food prices for the citizenry.\u201d\n\nShe further said the Council was briefed about the rising inflation rate and the need to manage the cost of inflation in the country.\n\nAhmed added that FEC considered a report from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning for the first quarter of 2022 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report which showed that the Nigerian economy grew by 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2022, as against a growth of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of last year.\n\nHer words: \u201cThis growth shows a gradual economic stability from the recession that we witnessed in 2020. And also it shows the six quarter of positive growth that the Nigerian economy has presented.\n\n\u201cSo of the 46 economic activities, the bulk sector performance show that services sector grew strongly by 4.7 per cent, agriculture also grew by 3.61 per cent, Industry on the other hand contracted by minus 6.81 per cent and there was also a significant contraction in the crude oil, petroleum and natural gas sector of 26.04 per cent.\n\n\u201cCoal mining sector also declined, oil refinery the biggest contraction of 44.26 per cent, electricity sector, textile outcome. Therefore, even though there has been growth in some sectors, there are significant contraction than others but the net effect is positive growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very mindful of the fact that unless we have most of the sectors growing especially the growth in the jobs impacted sectors, that this growth that is positive will not be directly felt by the people.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe also reported to Council that inflation has started going upward to the extent that the monetary authorities of the Central Bank of Nigeria have had to adjust the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 13 per cent at the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting and that\u2019s an attempt to manage the cost of inflation.\n\n\u201cSo, Council has decided to set up a special effort to look at the sectors that are not growing and also to look at how we can grow the other sectors better.\u201d\n\nAlso briefing newsmen after the FEC meeting, Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, said the Council approved the contract, \u201cto supply and install emergency restoration system or 330 kV and 132KV transmission line for ongoing rehabilitation works in Lagos at the sum of $968,818 as the offshore component, the onshore component is N7,393 million and the contractor is Rab Power Industries Limited.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the update on the federal government electricity deal with Siemen of Germany, he explained that he recently toured their facilities in Germany to ascertain the level of work in the production of the equipment and was satisfied with the spate of work so far.\n\nAccording to him, despite the impact of the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war which slowed down the process of their production, he had been able to get Siemen committed to supply 10 mobile transformers to be installed in the country by September this year.\n\nHe disclosed that works are ongoing in the country as contractors are already working on the sites to prepare grounds for the installation of the equipment immediately they arrive in the country.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, disclosed that the Council approved the memo for the NNPC Limited to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline to take gas to 15 West African countries and through Morocco to Spain and Europe.\n\nGiving a breakdown of contracts approved for his ministry, he said N3.8 billion was approved for the construction of a switchgear room, an installation of power distribution cables and equipment for the Nigeria Oil and Gas Park in Ogbehia, Bayelsa state.\n\nThis, he said, was to support local manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.\n\nSylva added that, \u201cCouncil also approved various contracts for the construction of an access road with bridges to the brass petroleum product depot in Nibomoyekiri in brass local government in the sum of N11 billion plus 7.5 per cent VAT.\u201d\n\nThe Council also okayed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the purchase of 82 Toyota brand of vehicles, branded raincoats and sundry other accoutrements for the use of the Nigerian Police at the total cost of N8,315,209,825.\n\nThis came following approval for the Nigerian Police Trust Fund to award contracts for the supply of sundry accoutrements for the efficient operation of the Police.\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, who disclosed this while also briefing newsmen after the FEC meeting, said the approval included the supply of customised raincoat for distribution to police formations across the country at the cost of N1.9 billion.\n\nDingyadi who said the memo which received the nod of the cabinet, included customised Police boots at the cost of N576 million.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe also got approval for the supply of micro first aid kits for the police at the cost of N1 billion as well as customised instructional materials for the police colleges and schools at the cost of N664 million.\n\n\u201cThere is also the supply of drugs and medical equipment for police hospitals across the country at the cost of N2 billion.

          "text": "\u2022Some govs want to go south; Adamu, others prefer north\n\n\u2022Party may reopen sale of forms to broaden choices for candidates\n\n\u2022Moves to encourage El-Rufai, Zulum to join race\n\nOlawale Olaleye\n\n\n\nFour days to the rescheduled presidential primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), billed to hold Monday, June 6, in Abuja, the leadership of the party, has remained divided on the zoning of its ticket, even as it continues to ponder the options opened to it to match the presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThe current state of play in the APC, has been further compounded by the differing positions of its stakeholders on the zoning palaver, a development, which has seen some governors insisting on going south for balancing, while the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, in cahoots with a few others, would rather go north, for political expediency.\n\nInterestingly, the development, has pushed the party leadership to consider the reopening of sales of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to more members by way of broadening its choices for a suitable presidential candidate, that would secure the confidence of the people and lead the party to victory.\n\nAlready, two persons being targeted to encourage to join the race, are the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and his Borno State counterpart, Professor Babagana Zulum, even though the later had since dismissed the idea of looking at other possibilities in 2023, except returning to Borno to finish off what he had started.\n\nThe APC was first thrown into confusion, when Atiku emerged candidate of the PDP at a keenly contested presidential primaries in Abuja, a situation, which completely unsettled the thinking and extrapolations in the ruling party.\n\nUnfortunately, the confusion was further accentuated on Monday, when President Muhammadu Buhari, at a meeting with the 22 governors of the party and Adamu, pleaded with the stakeholders to let him choose his successor as a sign of reciprocity.\n\nBuhari, in a two-page speech, reminded the governors that, while those governors, who just served their first terms, had a field day securing their tickets to return to office, the outgoing ones, after serving out their constitutional two terms of eight years, also had the privileges to choose their successors.\n\nHe, therefore, enjoined them all to let him too enjoy same privileges through \u201creciprocity\u201d of similar action, to choose his successor at the proposed June 6 presidential primaries.\n\nBy implications, the president had ruled out the possibility of an elective convention but a consensus option that would allow him choose his proffered candidate, who would be affirmed on Monday, at the Eagle Square, in Abuja.\n\nBut since this new thinking was thrown into the mix by the president, the leadership of the party, including the governors, as major stakeholders, had started pondering the options opened to them and particularly, lead them to victory.\n\nThus, while some of the governors insisted that it would remain indefensible to go north, since Buhari, a northerner, would be serving out eight years in 2023, others, including the national chairman of the party, believed going north was the surest path to victory, if they must match Atiku in all the boxes critical to their victory in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nTo this end, the party leadership, has resolved to consider reopening the sales of forms to some members of the party by way of broadening the options and further opening up the turf to more candidates for a competitive approach to the ticket, even when the president had said without equivocation that, there would be no election.\n\nIn their consideration as they came up with this idea, THISDAY gathered, were El-Rufai and Zulum, a move believed would help them push some of their best from the north into the race and put the party on a sure-footing ahead of the elections.\n\nIt is not certain yet if El-Rufai would buy into the idea, having said time and time again that, he was not interested in the presidency and that he believed in the need for power to shift to the south after Buhari\u2019s eight years, because it was the right thing to do.\n\nZulum, on his part, had been touted earlier as a possible option for running mate to whoever emerged the candidate of the party, but had openly come out to turn down the idea, saying also that, while it was a good thing to consider him for the office, especially, given the privileges attached to it, he preferred to return to Borno to consolidate the work he had started.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the governors had maintained the position, that despite Buhari\u2019s appeal for reciprocity in the choice of his successor, they too had a responsibility as stakeholders to advise and guide him on the suitability of his choice candidate for the party.\n\nIndeed, many of the governors, who were insistent on going south, held the view that there was no need to panic over the emergence of Atiku in the PDP, because with a strong southern candidate, which they claimed to have in good numbers, the party would still comfortably defeat Atiku in 2023.\n\nAside not seeing anything wrong in pandering to Buhari\u2019s request for reciprocity, many of the governors still believed that an acceptable choice of successor was key, not just to their victory at the general election, but to help prevail on other contenders, who would be persuaded to stand down for the sake of the president.\n\nAgainst this background, while waiting for Buhari to return from his trip to Madrid, Spain, and present his candidate to the party ahead of the convention, a majority of the governors still stood strong against going north, notwithstanding the fears of other stakeholders, including Adamu.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "\u2022Ayu: The convention was family affair, declares \u2018no victor no vanquished\u2019\n\n\u2022Wike visits former vice president at his Asokoro residence\n\nChuks Okocha\n\nFormer vice president, Atiku Abubakar yesterday received his certificate of return as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections, urging the party to bear in mind that there was much work to be done before victory.\n\nHe spoke as the National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu called for a united party, describing the outcome of the special national presidential convention as a family affair where there was no victor and no vanquished.\n\nAccording to Atiku who spoke on his victory at the convention, \u201cwe should not take that or their defeat for granted. We must unite and work extremely hard for every single vote in this country. There is so much to do. And there is very little time to waste. So let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n\nAtiku who called for unity in the PDP further said, \u201cLet us all remember that what just happened is a contest within a family to decide how to put our best foot forward. The main contest is the one to win the presidency of our country for our party.\n\n\u201cIt will require the entire PDP family and other supporters and sympathisers. We must pull everyone together. Nobody should be excluded; I beg of you\u201d.\n\nThe former vice president said he had already visited some of those who contested against him, \u201cas a way to lead in that effort to unify the party so that we can face our real opponents, defeat them in the elections and begin the process of rescuing and rebuilding this country from the calours and dangerous All Progressives Congress (APC) misrule over the past seven years which is there for everyone to see.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cI am honored and humbled to receive this Certificate of Return having emerged as our party\u2019s candidate in our just concluded special convention. This victory is a victory for all of us, for our party, and for the vast majority of Nigerians suffering under the misrule of the APC. It was a collective effort, and I\u2019m very grateful for everybody\u2019s contributions.\u201d\n\nExpressing his gratitude, Atiku said, \u201cI am particularly grateful that you kept your word and gave us contestants fair treatment, despite what might have been a difficult situation.\n\n\u201cYour integrity and even handedness must be commended. I commend our party\u2019s National Executive Committee for putting our party and our country first in its deliberations and decision-making process.\n\n\u201cI thank all those who assisted my campaign in a variety of ways to enable me to crisscross this vast country and make my case for our delegates and other party elders and members.\n\n\u201cTo all those who volunteer their time to help with organising the convention, as well as the security personnel and agencies who ensured that the event was successful, I say thank you very much indeed.\n\n\u201cI also thank my family, for putting up with my demands and the disruption this quest to serve obviously brought about.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the NWC for transforming the party secretariat.\n\n\u201cSo let me commend the National Working Committee for transforming this place into a decent and beautiful place. This is a clear evidence that, if we have a new PDP government, we will transform this country,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his speech, the PDP chairman said that the event was not a celebration of victory.\n\n\u201cRather within the PDP family, we had a minor contest, a small contest within the family. There were no victors, there were no vanquishes, the party won. It is the party that won. Atiku Abubakar is not yet victorious. He has only been produced as our candidate, the candidate of the whole party.\n\n\u201cAs we marched forward, we need all of you because each one of you had a supporter and all of you plus all your supporters, we want you all to fuse together into one happy political family. It is this family that will face the battle ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have only started a journey. We shall end this journey sometime next year. By the first of June next year, we should take over power from colourless and clueless government that has totally destroyed this country.\n\n\u201cAll of you are aware of what has happened to our country in the last seven years. I don\u2019t need to repeat issues of insecurity, total destruction of the economy, total disunity of the country. We have never been as divided as we are today as a country. Families are divided, communities are divided against each other.\n\n\u201cThere is no trust among ourselves. The president that is coming in is tested and trusted. He will lead us to reunite the country. He will lead us to rebuild the economy. He will lead us to get rid of bandits and terrorists. He will re-enforce the armed forces.\n\n\u201cHe will give us respect in the international community. Today we are a pariah state but in the next 12 months, the whole world will begin to respect Nigeria all over again.\n\n\u201cI urge all of you to come together. It doesn\u2019t matter which candidate you supported, come together and support the party, support our efforts, support our candidates, the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and I want to assure you that we in the National Working Committee will continue to work tirelessly because you didn\u2019t elect to us to organise a successful convention, you elected us to win the presidency for you.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cYou elected us to give you more governors, you elected us to take control of the two houses of the National Assembly. You elected us to win all the Houses of Assembly across the states and we will continue to do just that by working with you, by calling on many of you to come and help us execute these objectives because we can\u2019t do it alone. \u201c\n\nHe said that the occasion is to appreciate members of the party for a job well done\n\nPresent at the occasion were Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State; Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State; former Delta State Governor, James Ibori;\n\nDarius Ishaku of Taraba State and some of the presidential aspirants , including, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, Bukola Saraki, Sam Ohuabunwa and the only female presidential aspirant, Olivia Terila Diana among others\n\nMeanwhile, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike yesterday visited the PDP presidential candidate at his Asokoro residence. The visit was barely 24 hours that Atiku visited Wike in company of some PDP officials.\n\nAtiku who confirmed Wike\u2019s visit in his verified tweeter handle wrote: \u201cIt was a pleasure to receive His Excellency Nyesom Wike in the company of notable leaders and officials of our great party, the PDP at my residence today.\n\n\u201cI am proud of the promises that this spirit of camaraderie holds for our party as a united front that guarantees victory in the next election to rescue the country.\u201d\n\nWike was absent at the PDP secretariat when the Certificate of return was handed over to Atiku by the Ayu-led NWC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Judge orders substituted service\n\n\n\nSunday Aborisade, Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered that the Labour Party and some of its officials be served with a fresh suit pertaining to its leadership crisis through a substituted means.\n\nThe judge, Inyang Ekwo, made the order on Monday after hearing an ex parte application filed by a former Deputy national chairman of the party, Calistus Okafor.\n\nIn the court order seen by our reporter on Wednesday, the judge ordered that the defendants be served through the pasting of the court documents filed by the plaintiff at the Labour Party\u2019s secretariat in Abuja within seven days.\n\nOkafor, a factional leader of the party, is by his suit, challenging the legality of the leadership of Akingbade Oyelakin, whom he said \u201crepresents persons wrongfully and unlawfully parading themselves as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of Labour Party\u201d.\n\nHe also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as a co-defendant.\n\nOthers sued by Okafor include Julius Abure and Umar Farouq who emerged as the national chairman and the secretary of the party, respectively, at a national executive committee meeting of the party held in Benin, Edo State, in March 2021.\n\nThe rest of the defendants sued by the defendants are members of the committee set up by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to take over the affairs of the party.\n\nThe committee members are Salisu Mohammed, Lawson Osagie, Isa Aremu, Baba Aye, Ikpe Ektokudo, Sylvester Ejiofor, and Lucy Offiong. Sued along with them are one Salamatu Aliyu and the NLC.\n\nThe court in its order issued on Monday ordered a \u201csubstituted service of the originating summons, interlocutory injunction, and all other processes in this suit on the 1st to 3rd, 6th to 12th and 14th defendants by pasting the said processes at their political party\u2019s office, which is the 5th defendant\u2019s office, located at No 2, Oke Agbe Street, Off Ladoke Akintoal Boulevard, Garki 11, Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe 1st to 3rd defendants are Abure, Farouq and Oyelakin. The 6th to the 12th defendants are the members of the NLC committee and the 14th defendant is Aliyu.\n\nThe court ordered that the service must be effected \u201cwithin seven days of this order.\u201d\n\nThe judge then adjourned the case until June 30 \u201cfor further mention\u201d.\n\nTHISDAY had reported how Okafor threatened to file the suit and how the legal action might threaten the presidential ambition of a former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, who left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) last week and emerged as the presidential candidate of the LP faction led by Abure.\n\nHowever, Okafor told THISDAY that Obi decided to defect to LP without proper information on the fact that the party\u2019s leadership had been a subject of litigation since 2018.\n\nOkafor claimed that he remained the authentic national chairman of the party. He explained that he got the post by virtue of his position as Deputy National Chairman of the party when the late national chairman, Abdulsalam, was in office. He added that Abure, who is currently leading a faction of the party, was Acting National Secretary, when Abdulsalam, died in 2020.\n\nOkafor further claimed that Abure announced himself as National Chairman without recourse to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution, following Abdulsalam\u2019s demise. He said the LP constitution stipulated that the deputy national chairman should act and/or replace the chairman in the event of death or resignation.\n\nOkafor explained, \u201cThe decision of Abure to make himself chairman, with the active collaboration of some members, actually led to the current leadership crisis in the LP.\n\n\u201cI, Calistus Okafor, approached the court to get a pronouncement to force Abure out and the case has been pending.\n\n\u201cThe matter will come up tomorrow (today) at the Federal High Court. There is no way we would allow an Acting National Secretary to forcefully take over the party and replace the late national chairman against the provisions of the constitution of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NLC and the TUC actually registered the Labour Party in 2006, but they were not the ones administering it.\n\n\u201cPeter Obi, at the moment, has been deceived and he is sitting on a keg of gunpowder and it is a pity. He went to wolves in sheep clothing thinking he was discussing with the right people. Staying in the PDP would have been better for him.\n\n\u201cThe LP has not done any convention since 2014, after the last one it did in Akure, the Ondo State capital.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Appetito, an on-demand grocery retail business that delivers groceries to users from a small network of dark stores in Cairo, announced on Tuesday the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup which operates in Rabat, and the Greater Tunis area of Morocco and Tunisia respectively.\n\nPer a press release shared with TechCabal by Appetito co-founder Shehab Mokhtar, the deal is expected to close by the third quarter of 2022, but the two companies have reached an agreement to operate under Appetito as a single entity. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to welcome unparalleled talent and like-minded entrepreneurs to our family. We\u2019re 12 months ahead of our plan to expand in Africa,\u201d Mokhtar said in the statement.\n\nBoth companies have already begun to train staff together, Lamma co-founder and CEO Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi told TechCabal on a call.\n\nCiting sources close to the matter, Techcrunch reported that the deal is valued between $10 million and $15 million, prompting concerns about how Appetito funded it since it only announced a $2 million pre-series round and raised $2.5 million since it began operations in March 2020. But Mokhtar told Techcrunch that his company expects to soon close an 8-figure round to support the expansion.\n\nAppetito co-founders and Lamma co-founder, Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi. Photo: Appetito\n\nLamma began as a ridesharing app in 2020, but after participating in the Flat6Labs Tunis accelerator program last June, the startup shifted its focus to the quick commerce logistics business. It also raised $72,500 from Flat6Labs Tunis and Orange Ventures in April and October last year, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nThe firm has since embarked on an ambitious expansion program that took it into neighbouring Morocco early this year and has now seen it merge with Egypt\u2019s Appetito.\n\nIn April, when TechCabal called Appetito\u2019s strong focus on the dark store model \u201ca test for multi-node last-mile distribution in Africa,\u201d the company said they planned to add 50 dark stores every year until 2024 as part of its plans to cover Cairo, Giza, and Alexandria. With the addition of Rabat and the Greater Tunis area, it appears that the new Appetito already has its hands full.\n\nEl Idrissi, the Lamma co-founder who will be joining Appetito to lead its growth and expansion, says the firm will focus on consolidating in the markets it is already operating in. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy growth in the long term,\u201d he told TechCabal, \u201cso the first focus of our work is to make sure that our current operations, which are in three countries, are solid. And we have a lot to do in Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia.\u201d The firm, he explained, would only continue international expansion when it was appropriate.\n\nIt makes sense to consolidate and grow locally. On one hand, Appetito\u2019s Egyptian rivals Breadfast and Rabbit (which also operates in Saudi Arabia) are eyeing the same customers as Appetito. And globally, quick-commerce grocery startups have struggled since the second quarter of the year with Getir, Gorillas, and GoPuff announcing layoffs.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Patricia\u2019s CEO on taking risks and building for impact",
          "text": "Hanu Fejiro may today, at 26, sit atop a crypto exchange company boasting of 30,000 daily transactions and 660,000 users, but only a few years ago, he knew little about cryptocurrencies. The company in question, Patricia Technologies\u2014or just Patricia\u2014was originally registered in Nigeria as a gift card exchange after Fejiro fell into the hands of fraudsters.\n\nHe\u2019d received a gift card worth \u20a630,000 (~$73), in 2015, from his uncle in the US, in lieu of a monthly allowance. Needing to exchange the gift card for cash, he went online to transact with a gift card exchange, only to fall victim to a scam. Gift card scams are commonplace: users are asked to disclose the card\u2019s number, unwittingly granting the scammer access to its funds. After his experience, Fejiro figured that if he was getting scammed, others were too; building an exchange where people could safely exchange their gift cards for cash was an obvious opportunity. And he seized it.\n\nFor the next 2 years, from 2017 through 2018, Patricia would operate as a gift card exchange. But not for long.\n\nIn 2019, Fejiro transitioned Patricia from gift card exchanging to a line that he found to be blossoming in popularity and demand: crypto trading. Nigeria was on the cusp of being identified, within the next 2 years\u20142020 and 2021\u2014as a leading crypto economy. The stats thrown around about this development functioned as both news headlines and high praise for the country\u2019s crypto adoption rate. The highest number of Google searches for \u201cbitcoin\u201d came from Nigeria. Twenty-three-point-seven percent of Nigerians online owned some form of cryptocurrency. Businesses were adding crypto plugins to their payment options. Trading volumes were surpassing $1 million per day on Binance.\n\nIf an economy could be a crypto heaven, Nigeria was looking like it. But the country\u2019s government did not share the enthusiasm. Soon, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) would descend its regulatory hammer on crypto trading, and Fejiro would have to think fast to save his young business.\n\nThinking fast, moving faster\n\nFejiro is speaking to me from Dubai. It has taken me and his team 5 weeks to schedule this interview; there\u2019d been a scheduling conflict in February and a long silence after that, until April, when he gets on a call with me, 6 minutes late, battling a cold that sometimes fogs up his voice. And yet, the story he tells me over the course of an hour, about himself and Patricia, is clear and does not stumble. It\u2019s a story he\u2019s told so many times he knows it backwards\u2014which comes as no surprise; he will write his memoir someday, he assures me, and is already shooting footage of his life for a future documentary.\n\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Port Harcourt, studying mathematics and statistics, he\u2019d done everything he could to make some extra change. He sold noodles, then popcorn, then started a clothing company, and had even attempted to start a taxi business. The list of start-and-stop businesses to his credit would eventually stretch from 5 to 13\u2014all before his hit venture: Patricia.\n\nI wonder at his going bullish on several entrepreneurial ventures while still in school. I ask as delicately as I can manage: was he poor? He says no. He\u2019d lost his dad when he was 8 and his mum when he was 16, just before university, but he hadn\u2019t lacked anything; his extended family took good care of him. He just had always been entrepreneurial, he says. When he was in primary school, growing up in Warri, south-south Nigeria, he distributed candy to 4 primary schools in his neighbourhood, earning enough profit to pay his family\u2019s rent for 2 years.\n\nFejiro has an uncomplicated relationship with executing his ideas; he does not overthink them. In his world, if it sounds like a plan, it probably is. He\u2019d christened his company by its curious name on a whim: his mother\u2019s name was Patience, but his grandfather preferred to call her Patricia, to annoy her, and start an argument\u2014every time. Many years later, when Patricia popped into Fejiro\u2019s head as a suggestion for his company\u2019s name, he didn\u2019t think about it twice.\n\n\u201cYou may spend so much time thinking and not acting fast enough,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd the market is actually moving. You need to be able to move as fast as the market. When you spend too much time thinking, you end up losing everything.\u201d\n\nAnd so, when the CBN suddenly banned commercial banks from facilitating crypto transactions, Fejiro knew he had to think\u2014and act\u2014 quickly.\n\nNews of the ban had dropped on February 5, 2021, a Friday afternoon. Reactions to it on social media were riotous, angry, and pained. The apex bank had not only proscribed banks from servicing crypto transactions, it had ordered them to close all accounts found to be used for crypto trading. Worse, the following week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) banned crypto use altogether.\n\nWhen it became clear that the country\u2019s regulations had a hostile attitude towards crypto use, Fejiro relocated Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, famous\u2014at the time\u2014for its liberal crypto regime. This was 5 months after the ban in Nigeria.\n\nThe Estonian business environment is famously progressive. The country has an e-residency programme\u2014the first country in the world to introduce this; a young entrepreneur can easily incorporate their startup there, in a process that takes less than an hour and costs less than \u20ac5,000\u2014all based on a residency permit that is entirely digital. The country had even considered introducing its own national cryptocurrency, the estcoin, in 2017.\n\nBut the Estonian crypto party would not last long. Three months after Patricia\u2019s relocation, the Estonian government opened discussions to tighten its crypto regulations; in March this year, the tightening became law, a move directed at combating rising fraud and money laundering issues associated with its earlier liberal crypto regulations.\n\nAlthough Fejiro supports the tightened regulations, it would seem that he is cautious about camping his business too close to regulatory quick fire. He moved Patricia\u2019s headquarters to Lithuania.\n\n\u201cWe moved out of Estonia when the law became too stringent for us to operate,\u201d he says.\n\nWay bigger than him now\n\nFejiro rises at 7:30 AM, every day. Three times a week his day begins with him receiving management updates from a team he had gradually built from 2 to over 350 employees spread across Ghana, Lithuania, the UK, Nigeria, and China. The management meetings set the tone of his day. Although he describes himself as a risk taker, building a thriving business may have given that trait an altruistic edge. When he started Patricia, he\u2019d invested all his personal money in the venture, but he tells me now that that kind of risk taking is well behind him. \u201cWhen you start a company, you really have nothing to lose except your life savings\u2014and that\u2019s just my life savings. I will take risks, though,\u201d he cautions, lest I get it twisted, \u201cbut at the scale we\u2019re at now, I wouldn\u2019t take a bet-the-company risk, because Patricia is way bigger than me now.\u201d\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "Even after a $10,000 loss, this crypto trader found a gem in the crypto space, and she\u2019s never letting go",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you ready to part with all your money? Are you prepared to lose everything? This is what an expert crypto trader who identifies simply as Ademi asks anyone who wants to make money from crypto. Even after losing $10,000, she still sticks to crypto trading as a career.\n\nAdemi decided to forge a career out of trading crypto and NFTs when she realised how efficient cryptocurrencies are for cross-border transactions.\n\nMy dealings with expert crypto traders have revealed that most of them began trading because they believed strongly in the technology, which made researching the best ways to make money easier.\n\nTheir journeys seldom started with a desire to make money; they often gave in to their curiosity and desire to understand what made them efficient, their shortcomings, how they worked, and their technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdemi got interested five years ago, in 2017, when a friend suggested crypto has a payment option, that are instant, and cross borders quickly. She marvelled at the possibilities and became curious about cryptocurrencies. And that was the beginning of the journey.\n\nWhile crypto traders might flaunt their wealth on social media, the journey to becoming an expert is long and unpleasant. But nothing would deter Ademi as she set out to make some money with crypto and turn it into a career.\n\nStarting with the 2017 bull market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nA crypto bull market is a time when the value of crypto assets keeps rising. It is a time when crypto investors and traders are almost always in the green, and the media goes agog with news of all-time highs and mind-boggling market caps.\n\nIt\u2019s when most people decide to invest in crypto to get a piece of the action. However, a bear market \u2014 what comes at the end of a bull market \u2014 is what separates the newbies from the experts.\n\nThe 2017 bull run was huge. For context, Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, went from $900 to almost $20,000 between May and December. However, just as Bitcoin reached the $20,000 limelight, it was followed by a 30% drop that bloodied the entire crypto market.\n\nBy 2018, Bitcoin had dropped 80% below its initial all-time high in 2017, going as low as $3,500. While it might seem overly dramatic to describe it as a catastrophe, it is a mild way to put it in the eyes of investors who had to watch their investments bleed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@nampoh?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Maxim Hopman</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-fall?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nLike most newbies, Ademi found the 2017 bull run attractive and saw a chance to cash out, not knowing one of the worst bear markets of all time was just around the corner.\n\nShe lost money to the unforgiving bear market but had already learnt how to trade futures, a way to make money even when crypto charts are as crimson red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFutures trading isn\u2019t a hack to make money when the market is on a downtrend; it is considerably more difficult than regular trading.\n\nIt is a way to invest in assets by betting on what their price will be in the future. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than it sounds, but that\u2019s the idea. Ademi was a fast learner, and while the 2018 crypto meltdown did a number on her for some time, futures trading helped her leverage the meltdown.\n\nDetour to crypto influencing\n\nAdemi isn\u2019t just making money speculating what direction crypto assets will take; she also makes money influencing people\u2019s choices on what exchange they use and even which assets they invest in.\n\nShe got in early and spent a lot of time understanding the space, which has helped her build a following over time. As an undergraduate in 2017, Ademi was already learning the crypto ropes, and as soon as she graduated, she landed a job with the crypto exchange, Quidax.\n\n\u201cI mostly organised training for people on how to trade crypto. And I eventually got employed by Quidax.\u201d\n\nWhen you can learn all there is to know about crypto trading as fast as Ademi, a nine-to-five doesn\u2019t seem like an exciting option. After a few months, she left Quidax to be a full-time crypto trader.\n\n\u201cI decided to be on my own after a little while just trading, and it seemed to be working for me. It actually did; 2019 was a good year. I also got to work with people that I met on Twitter.\u201d\n\nFrom talking crypto and sharing trading tips on Twitter, Ademi was gradually becoming an influencer, and she was about to start reaping fruits.\n\nShe had always done most of her trading on BitMex, but it wasn\u2019t optimal enough, making her and some other users lose money. Either price changes didn\u2019t reflect early enough or the platform suffered from system overload.\n\nIt was time for a change, and Ademi was introduced to Bybit. Like BitMex, Bybit offered futures trading, a feature not many exchanges had at the time. Seeing how good Bybit was, Ademi recommended it to her community, and that was where she started reaping influencer profits.\n\n\u201cBecause I was early, I got many people to sign up using my referral link. In addition to profits from trading crypto, I was also able to get income from referrals that I actually didn\u2019t expect, to be honest.\u201d\n\nBy the end of 2019, Bitcoin was trading at about $7,200, and Ademi earned two Bitcoins from all her referrals. Considering profits from trading, 2019 was indeed a good year.\n\nThe NFT holy grail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto trading and influencing were going well for Ademi, but the crypto space constantly evolves and keeping up with the trends could fetch a lot of money.\n\nNFTs were the new trends, and Ademi was not going to be left out. As usual, she didn\u2019t jump in right away; she observed, learnt, and decided to take a dip into the NFT pool last year, and that was when things got interesting.\n\nTrading NFTs started beautifully, with her first NFT coming from the Cool Cats collection. A collection of anthropomorphised 2D cats now has a floor price of 3.4 Eth, which is ~ $12,000.\n\nAdemi got in early, and she made a 100% gain on her investment in the Cool Cats, a very cool start to NFT trading.\n\nIn the crypto game, you quickly learn that things will not always be rosy, regardless of whether you are trading NFTs or trading futures.\n\nAdemi was about to find this out the hard way; asides from the Cool Cats, she had bought into another project that brought her more good fortunes, and NFTs seemed to be the next best thing.\n\nShe decided to go big on NFTs and bought into a collection for $10,000. The collection had good hype, the kind that could result in very high percentage gains, but even in crypto, as with most things, not all that glitters is gold.\n\nAdemi watched as her $10,000 plummeted to almost $0.\n\nWhile $10,000 is a lot of money, she was unfazed by the loss. Some people might decide to call it quits with all things crypto at this point, but to Ademi, it was just another day in the crypto sphere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gotten to that point. Because at the end of the day, crypto brought me here. I started with literally nothing, actually, and crypto brought me here. So I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come to the point where I\u2019ll be like, \u2018no more crypto for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nCrypto as a full-time job\n\nAfter Ademi\u2019s brief stint at Quidax, she never took another job because crypto paid the bills despite $10,000 losses. She had already found something she was good at, and chasing a nine-to-five was unnecessary.\n\nImportantly, Ademi\u2019s crypto career transcended just trading, technical analysis, and staring at charts.\n\nIn addition to teaching and being an influencer, Ademi has a knack for running and managing crypto projects. She is familiar with marketing tactics, what projects are doing wrong, and which projects are likely to succeed or fail.\n\nCrypto trading has been touted as the biggest, if not the only, opportunity that came with the advent of cryptocurrencies, but, according to Ademi, there are many ways to make life-changing money with crypto.\n\nTo her, the crypto space has morphed into an industry of its own creating brand new opportunities for people in different fields such as design, web development, engineering, marketing, and content creation.\n\nThis is why Ademi remains a firm believer in the crypto space, and even when the market decides to bleed for months on end, crypto brought her here, and crypto will keep her here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

I mean, as a reader, this should matter to you.\n\nYesterday, June 1, 2022, Google announced the integration of two of its video-calling apps, Duo and Meet, into a single platform.\n\nThis means that there will only be Google Meet, and Google expects that it will be the only calling app users need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, Slack is introducing new features like the ability to add name pronunciation guides either by recording audio or adding phonetic spelling to promote team collaboration and connection.\n\nLastly, Instagram has incorporated Amber Alerts, a tool that helps locate kidnapped children, into users\u2019 feeds. While the feature was only launched in the United States yesterday, the company plans to expand it to 25 countries in the coming days.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Victoria Fabunmi helps founders get capital\n\nTalk360\u2019s $4 million seed\n\nAppetito\u2019s acquisition\n\nHow Victoria Fabunmi helps founders get capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fabunmi. Source: LinkedIn\n\nI mentioned yesterday that the editorial team is cooking. These meals are ready for consumption. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve started to enjoy them.\n\nStill unclear? I\u2019ll help you out. The editorial team \u2014 Nifemi, Emmanuel, Chimgozirim, Bolu, and Ogheneruemu \u2014 have got new and \u201cretouched\u201d series. And if you noticed, we also brought back How I Work, handled by Samuel our content guru.\n\nWhether you\u2019re interested in blockchain, AI, IoT, how tech helps everyday people, experts\u2019 journeys in tech, East Africa coverage, or venture capital and startups, we\u2019ve got you covered!\n\nOn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team discussed their series and why you should care. While you know Nifemi\u2019s The Experts, I\u2019d like to discuss Chimgozirim\u2019s series, Equity Merchants, today.\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular, you\u2019re probably familiar with Chimgozirim as the guy who covers VCs and startups in Africa. Well, his new series is not far from this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019ll talk to angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity merchants, and founders. If you want to understand how the Venture Capital market works, look for his story every Wednesday at 12 p.m. WAT!\n\nHe\u2019s also adding a podcast and a newsletter. While the articles will be available on the website every Wednesday at 12 p.m. WAT, the podcast can be found anywhere you get your podcasts, and the newsletter will be sent directly to your inbox. Isn\u2019t this fantabulous?\n\nIn his words, this week\u2019s story is the \u201cmost interesting conversation he has ever had in a long time.\u201d Chimgozirim had a chat with Victoria Fabunmi, CcHUB\u2019s Head of Investment.\n\nInterestingly, Fabunmi, like many Nigerian students, was unsure of her career path despite studying accounting at the University of Lagos in Nigeria.\n\nYou can probably relate if you are or were a Nigerian student. But how did you decide on a career path? You can share with me. I mean, I don\u2019t bite. \ud83d\ude01\n\nFor Fabunmi, she was determined to make a difference. And one way she could do that was to venture into investment banking to help businesses bridge the financing gap.\n\nClearly, her undergraduate degree had an impact on her career choice.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re wondering how to get started in venture capital; wonder no more! Irrespective of your background, you can get started. And Fabunmi gave some pointers on this.\n\nCheck them out here: How Victoria Fabunmi helps startup founders get capital to drive growth\n\nTalk360\u2019s $4 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk360, South Africa\u2019s international calling platform, had announced a $4 million seed round.\n\nHAVA\u00cdC led the round. 4Di Capital and some angel investors like Gaston Aussems, Robert Kraal, Gabriel de Montessuss, and Marnix van der Ploeg participated.\n\nIn 2016, Dean Hiine, Hans Osnabrugge, and Jorne Schamp launched the startup as a travelling app to avoid roaming fees. However, after social media apps like WhatsApp introduced Internet calls, the co-founders were forced to reconsider their model.\n\nNow, Talk360 is an African Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) provider that allows users to make international calls for a fee through its app.\n\nIt\u2019s quite different from a voice call on WhatsApp or Telegram, for instance. Only the person initiating the call requires the Talk360 app and an Internet-enabled smartphone.\n\nIn other words, the recipient doesn\u2019t need a smartphone or Internet access. Essentially, you can use it to reach your cousin who lives in a village where Internet penetration is low.\n\nTalk360 claims that it connected 2 million people in 2021. Besides, the startup relies on integrations with older payment service providers, which are severely limited by region.\n\nThe company wants to use some of its funding to build its own payment platform to make payment and checkout easier for its African users. According to Hiins, the platform will bring all of Africa\u2019s \u201cscattered payment methods\u201d onto a single platform.\n\nFurther, he believes that the product will provide businesses with access to Africa\u2019s largest pool of localised payment options.\n\nWhile the app is primarily used in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, the startup is looking to expand its international calling operations across Africa and build a hub in Kenya.\n\nAppetito acquires Lamma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppetito, Egypt\u2019s on-demand delivery startup, has acquired Lamma, a similar startup with operations in Tunisia and Morocco\u2019s Maghreb regions.\n\nLaunched by Shehab Mokhtar, Appetito delivers groceries and household products to customers from 11 dark stores across three cities in the North African country.\n\nIn 2020, Lamma was founded by Yassir El Ismaili El Idrissi, Hamza Guesmi, and Koussi Aymen as a carpooling service in Tunisia.\n\nSoon after that, the startup shifted to a quick commerce platform that delivers groceries, personal care, and fashion items to users in Tunisia and Morocco \u2014 which launched this year.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean? The Lamma team, its three dark stores, and a distribution centre will be integrated into Appetito as the two companies \u201cexplore many synergies.\u201d Also, El Idrissi will join Appetito as CEO.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Appetito intends to become the leading on-demand delivery player in frontier and emerging markets.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nBinance has open roles in Communication, Business Development, Customer Support, Engineering, Marketing, Product, Customer support, and other departments.

This is coming less than three months after the company went public through a SPAC.\n\nWhile the jury is still out on whether Swvl qualifies as an African company, this is the first layoff announced by an African company since the global downturn began. I pointed out that startups in Africa do not seem to be affected by the global downturn, but it may be too early to draw conclusions.\n\nWith Swvl pointing out that some of the roles they were laying off had been automated, it raises questions about how technology could contribute to rising unemployment in Africa.\n\nFor more on these stories, tune in to the Techpoint Africa Podcast on Spotify, Google Podcast, Apple Podcast, and any podcast platform you use.\n\nYou can also send feedback and questions to podcast@techpoint.africa or tweet using the hashtag #TechpointAfricaPodcast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain-based company, Vault Hill, has launched its NFT marketplace with the public sale of land in its human-centric metaverse, Vault Hill City (VHC). The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaverse, a Cardano ecosystem accelerator established to foster the growth of crypto-native projects in Africa, today announced its investment into a seed funding round for Cassava Network, a blockchain infrastructure that empowers African content creators, developers, and end-users through mutually aligned tasks and incentives. Over 40 investors, including Dragonfly, CMT Digital, YGG, Mirana, etc., participated in the recently closed investment round to implement the next phase of Cassava platform development.\n\nAdaverse was launched in September 2021 as a joint venture partnership between EMURGO Africa and Everest Ventures, to identify and provide valuable support resources to promising African founders building the next wave of Web3 dApps in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse tools on Cardano\u2019s third-generation and environmentally-sustainable blockchain.\n\nWhat is Cassava Network?\n\nCassava is a blockchain infrastructure that connects developers and users to the Web3 ecosystem. Through its native token CSV, Cassava transforms any web application into a crypto-enabled app suitable to reward contributors and end-users for their dedication. Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond. The next phase of Cassava development will include a multi-chain wallet that incentivizes users, an African-focused NFT Marketplace, and a rewards system that pays users for transacting and using apps in Cassava\u2019s ecosystem. \u201d\n\nThe market opportunity in the African creative space is enormous. Africa has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations, as well as the highest proportion of entrepreneurs among its working-class adults. Cassava is designed for the innovative youth seeking pan-African connectivity, and a global reach that will translate into sustainable, income-generating opportunities.\n\nWith regards to the global blockchain market, Africa alone is expected to possess a 30% market share and grow from a $1.1 billion market in 2020 to a $134.9 billion market by 2028.\n\n\u201cEMURGO Africa is excited to support the development of Cassava Network\u2019s innovative content rewards ecosystem. We firmly believe Africa is a huge market full of bright potential that can lead the way to spur large user growth and demonstrate the real benefits of a flourishing Web3 economy,\u201d said Shogo Ishida, Executive Director for the Middle East & Africa at EMURGO Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this partnership, which will help fund the revolutionary DeFi tool, which enables mobile applications to migrate to web 3.0 functionality that rewards content creation and user engagement. We are inspired and driven by projects with a strong use case, a resilient founder, and a long term vision to bring change to socio-economic challenges in Africa\u201d said Vincent Li Founding Partner at Adaverse.\n\nAbout Adaverse\n\nAdaverse is a Cardano-focused joint accelerator initiative \u2014 set up with the collaboration of EMURGO Africa, a subsidiary of EMURGO, the official commercial arm of the Cardano protocol, and Everest Ventures Group, a leading blockchain industry accelerator \u2014 looking to build the infrastructure of the projected $139.4 billion African blockchain market by 2028.

          "title": "Nigeria faces three-horse race in 2023",
          "text": "The 2023 general election scheduled to kick off in February promises to be interesting and tension-soaked.\n\nUnlike in 2019 when the race was purely between President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president and candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), this time around, the battle will be among the PDP candidate (Atiku); Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) and whoever that would emerge from the APC\u2019s Residential primary scheduled to hold from June 6 and 7.\n\nAlready, the political scene is charged and excitement is high that there are more choices than there were in 2019. Atiku emerged from a rancor-free primary election that observers however, say witnessed a great deal of wheeling and dealing.\n\nPeter Obi, who had a few days to the PDP convention tendered a resignation from the party and stood down from his presidential aspiration on that platform, joined the Labour Party to achieve his dream of re-engineering the country.\n\nThe APC on the other hand, which had played a \u201cmind game\u201d with the PDP, by shifting dates for its conventions, will eventually pick its standard bearer in a few days from now.\n\nAtiku Abubakar\n\nHe is not a new comer on the Nigeria\u2019s political scene. He is an astute politician and a juggernaut at that. A master strategist who has made marks in business, and education sectors, Atiku has pledged to unify the country. He has consistently claimed to be a \u201cUnifier\u201d; and makes no pretense about what he hopes to do when he gets to the Aso Rock in Abuja as the chief occupant.\n\nThe politician is a detribalised Nigerian, who has over the years, built bridges across the country. This is evident in his choice of wives as a Moslem. He picked one from each of the major blocs. The Board of Trustees (BoT) chairmen of his major businesses are people from other regions other than the north. He founded one of the best higher institutions in the country \u2013 American University of Nigeria (AUN) in Yola, his native home. The university is run by the best brains in the education sector with an American as its president (Vice Chancellor). A visit to the institution would convince any doubting Thomas that with an Atiku in the saddle as the next President of Nigeria, industrial actions by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) would be a thing of the past. The AUN offers scholarship to indigent students. A number of the girls who escaped from the Boko Haram den on that dark day in 2014 when the terrorists abducted hundreds of school young women, found habitation and rehabilitation in AUN. Some are also pursuing their academics in several other places across the globe on AUN\u2019s scholarship. A number of those girls have become hopeful as they have graduated from AUN and other institutions.\n\nAtiku\u2019s success in business is positively touching everyone in his native Adamawa State, particularly those who live in the Yola Township. From real estate to manufacturing and to media, he has established formidable institutions that contribute heavily to the nation\u2019s economy. Although a Moslem by religion, Atiku is broad-minded and accommodates the views of people of other religions.\n\nWhen he contested with Buhari in 2019, he did so excellently that some Nigerians still believe, very strongly, that he may have been robbed of that victory. But with Buhari not going to be on the ballot in 2023, pundits say his chances are brighter this time around.\n\nIn a message he sent out in the morning of Sunday after the party\u2019s primary, Atiku said: \u201cLast night was a momentous episode in our march to reclaim our dear country. Although I am not unaware that there was so much apprehension about the direction that the election could go, I was confident that with God on our side and based on the enormous work that everyone has put into this, we should record a resounding victory. And so it was!\n\n\u201cBut this victory is not enough. Indeed, it is a further call to duty. Now that delegates of our great party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party have done their bit, the challenge now is on you, and I, to present as ONE to get the job done.\n\n\u201cLet me remind you, once again, what this job is all about, dear compatriot. The job at hand for us is to ensure that we uproot the vestiges of bad governance that the ruling All Progressives Congress represents and begin to plant our UNITY SEED that will birth the New Nigeria of our dreams.\n\nLast week, I revealed an abridged version of my policy document, which contains details of my 5-point UNITY SEED agenda.\n\n\u201cDear compatriot, I will take it for granted that you\u2019ll ingrain the content of this policy document. Ours shall be a disciplined and issue-focused campaign, and I will urge you to get prepared for the task ahead, as we set forth.\n\nThe victory last night is yet another chapter in our historic the journey to redeem our country. It is my prayer that come this day, 29 May, next year, we shall get to work together in a government that will accommodate all Nigerians, especially the youth.\u201d\n\nRead also: \u2018We do not see voting patterns changing in 2023\u2019\n\nAtiku Abubakar\u2019s biography\n\nAtiku Abubakar a Nigerian politician was born in Jada, a village which was formerly under the administration of the British Cameroons, which later joined Nigeria. He became the only child to his parents, Garba Abubakar and Aisha Kande when his only sister died at infancy. Abubakar is married to four wives and has been blessed with twenty eight children. At an early age of eight, Abubakar started schooling at the Jada Primary School, Adamawa, which he completed in 1960. In the same year, Abubakar was admitted into Adamawa Provincial Secondary School. He graduated from the secondary school in 1965 after he made grade three in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination. Abubakar continued to study at the Nigeria Police College in Kaduna. He progressed to work as a tax officer in the regional Ministry of Finance; he gained admission to the School of Hygiene in Kano in 1966, where he finished with a diploma. He served as a student Union President at the time, and in the same year he enrolled for a Law diploma at the Ahmadu Bello University Institute of Administration.\n\nCareer\n\nAbubakar was employed by the Nigeria Custom Service after graduation in 1969. He is known to be a serial entrepreneur; he served with the Nigeria Customs Services for twenty years, and at some point, became the Deputy Director, the second highest position held within the system.\n\nAbubakar has been into the government system for a long time, precisely 1980s. He was elected the National Vice-chairman of the Peoples Front of Nigeria (PFN) which was denied registration by the military government. The PFN merged with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) when Abubakar contested and won the SDP primaries in November 1991, and got disqualified by the government. He contested for the SDP presidential primaries in 1993 where he came third with 2,066 votes. He also showed interest in the contest for the gubernatorial seat of Adamawa State under the United Nigeria Congress Party. In 1998, Abubakar joined the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and won the December 1998 governorship election for Adamawa State but also received an option to be running mate with Olusegun Obasanjo to the PDP Presidential seat in 1999, and won the election. Abubakar lasted as the vice president of the federation in the first and second term, although joined the Action Congress (AC) in 2006 toward the 2007 election, where he came third position. He returned to PDP, and in October 2010, he announced his intention to contest for the presidency which he lost in the primaries stage by having 805 votes compared to Goodluck Jonathan who garnered 2736 votes. In 2014, he joined the All Progressives Congress (APC) in a bid to run for the president\u2019s office but he lost at the primary stage to Muhammadu Buhari (3430 votes), Rabiu Kwankwaso (974 votes), and himself with 954 votes. He announced his exit from APC and claimed to return home as he joined the PDP in December 2017. He campaigned and won the primary election for 2019 under PDP, but lost to the incumbent president who won with over 3million votes against him.\n\nBusiness\n\nAbubakar is also into real estate, which he started long ago in 1974, when he applied and was given a loan of N31,000 which he used to build his first house in Yola; he eventually purchased lands and continued building houses he would usually rent out, and eventually he built a portfolio of property in Yola, Nigeria. He ventured into Agriculture at the age of 34 which eventually failed after five years and then he ventured into trading, buying and selling of truckloads of rice, flour, and sugar. Abubakar also ventured into the transportation sector of business; he joined Gabrielle Volpi, an Italian businessman in Nigeria to create the Nigeria Container Services (NICOTES), a logistics company that operated within the Apapa ports. He also co-founded Intels Nigeria Limited, which at a point featured in an accusation of money laundering by the U.S government. Abubakar generated other businesses which include an animal feed factory, Adama Beverages Limited, among others. He also plays in the education sector of the nation\u2019s economy. He is the founder of the American University of Nigeria (AUN). He also owns television and radio station, GOTEL Com.\n\nPeter Obi\n\nHe needs no introduction in the country right now. He has become a household name in many parts of the country. He scripted his name in the hearts of people by consistently saying the same thing and living out what he says in many practical ways. Many of those who tried to traduce him ended up bruising their noses. Peter Obi shut into Nigerian\u2019s consciousness when he turned Anambra from a collapsing state to a vibrant one with hope.\n\nBefore his arrival in the driver\u2019s seat of the state as governor, the state had been run aground. Schools had shut down for a whole academic year and things were really going wrong. Killings were everyday affair like what is going on currently, because of the reign of terror by a bloody vigilance group called \u201cBakassi Boys\u201d. He did not only return normalcy to the state; he also returned it to profitability as several records in the media space can attest. Unlike many politicians, Obi has no skeleton in his cupboard. His down-to-earth lifestyle, which unnecessarily infuriates some people, is his winning Joker.\n\nGradually, he has become a brand in the country. Even his virulent critics, in their sober moments, confess that Obi is the best Presidential material for Nigeria at this time. Obi\u2019s vision is to retool the country. His heart bleeds at the massive looking going on by those who were supposed to plug the high level of malfeasance going on. That was why when he saw the bazaar going on in the PDP in the name of delegates\u2019 votes and list, his heart bled. Anambra people can attest to his Midas touch in the state and they strongly believe that \u201cOkwute\u201d as he is fondly called is the antidote to Nigeria\u2019s numerous malaise.\n\nObi believes that the country has been hijacked by a few privileged elements, but must have to be returned to its rightful owners- the masses.\n\nHence, smarting from his victory at the Labour Party\u2019s primary Monday, he urged Nigerians, \u201cLet us return Nigeria to the rightful owners.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHistory beckons. Nigerians remain hopeful for a national rebirth, which implies returning Nigeria to Nigerians \u2013 farmers, teachers and students, lecturers, artisans, workers, pensioners and over a hundred million poor Nigerians who are not sure where their next meal will come from.\n\n\u201cTherefore, what you are doing today is a patriotic duty towards seeking the desired political emancipation of our dear country, which stands wounded by many years of cumulative leadership failure.\n\n\u201cPainfully, our current dysfunctional system rewards unearned income and conspicuous consumption; allows university lecturers to remain on strike for months; keep our youths at home; and owe pensioners, who gave their patriotic sweat and their youthful energy to serve this country.\n\n\u201cThe despicable contrast is that those responsible for the mess -those elected to take care of them \u2013 have abandoned the national currency and are living in opulence and like kings, spend dollars to buy delegates as well as houses all over the world. Meanwhile, they owe most workers, lecturers and retirees.\n\n\u201cYes, our country stands hijacked by forces of retrogression. We are almost zero in all indices of development. As a result, our future, especially those of the youth and generations unborn is in ruins. We have become a laughing stock among other nations, including African countries where we were once revered.\u201d\n\nObi also said: \u201cI note with humility that the journey is going to be a collective one that will certainly require the cooperation of critical stakeholders in our country, especially the youth, whose future has been thoroughly degraded.\n\n\u201cI therefore, thank all of you and call for your sustained support towards returning Nigeria to Nigerians from forces of bad leadership and retrogression. Such a noble tasks brooks no conscientious objectors.\n\n\u201cI hardly use war metaphors for political analysis due to my belief that politics is not adversarial and not war. However permit me a little indulgence here, to relate what we are embarking on to the ancient battle of Thermopylae, where the Greek forces, conscious of fighting for the life of Greece held on against great odds in the defence of their country.\n\n\u201cIn the battle to re-take Nigerian, the odds are great and seemingly insurmountable, but with our commitment, patriotism and understanding that we are doing, what we are supposed to do for our country, lest she shall die, we shall move on discontent with what is and focused on enthroning what ought to be. In doing this, our battle cry shall remain: get your PVC and become part of this great libration!\n\n\u201cOur governance mission will be twin-tracked. Secure Nigeria in every ramification: national security, human security, food security and tackling insecurity created by unemployment.\u201d\n\nBiography\n\nPeter Obi was born on 19th July 1961 at Onitsha. He had his secondary school education at Christ the King College, Onitsha. In 1980, Peter proceeded to University of Nigeria, Nsukka where he graduated with a B.A (Hons) in Philosophy in 1984.\n\nAfterwards, his love for academic took him outside the shore of Nigeria to Ivy League and Oxbridge schools. He also went to Harvard Business School, Boston, USA; London School of Economics where he studied Financial Management/Business Policy; Columbia Business School, New York, USA (Marketing Management); Institute for Management and Development, Switzerland; Kellogg Graduate School of Management, USA; Oxford University; Lagos Business School, Nigeria and Cambridge. Obi got married to Margaret BrownsonUsen in 1992 and they are blessed with two children.\n\nCareer\n\n\u2022Former Chairman: Board of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\u2022Former Chairman: Fidelity Bank Plc.\n\n\u2022Former Chairman: Guardian Express Mortgage Bank, Ltd.\n\n\u2022Former Chairman: Future Views Securities, Ltd.\n\n\u2022Former Chairman: Paymaster Nigeria Plc.\n\n\u2022Former Chairman: Next International (Nigeria) Ltd.\n\n\u2022Former Director: Guardian Express Bank Plc.\n\n\u2022Former Director: Chams Nigeria Plc.\n\n\u2022Former Director: Emerging Capital Ltd.\n\n\u2022Former Director: Card Centre Plc.\n\n\u2022Member, Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG).\n\n\u2022Member, Nigerian Chartered Institute of Bankers.\n\n\u2022Member, British Institute of Directors (IOD).\n\nPolitical career\n\n2006 \u2013 2014 \u2013 Governor, Anambra State of Nigeria.\n\n2006 \u2013 2014 \u2013 Chairman, South-East Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\n2008 \u2013 2014 \u2013 Vice-Chairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nTill May 2015 \u2013 He was the Honorary Special Adviser to the President on Finance.\n\nTill May 2015 \u2013 Member, Presidential Economic Management Team\n\nDuring his tenure as the Governor of Anambra State, he served as a member of;\n\n\u2022 Federal Government Committee on Minimum Wage.\n\n\u2022Federal Government Committee on Negotiation with Labour on Subsidy.\n\n\u2022Federal Government Committee on Mass Transit.\n\n\u2022Federal Government Committee on Natural Resource.\n\n\u2022 National Economic Council Committee on Power Sector Reform.\n\n\u2022National Economic Council Committee on Sharing of MDGs Funds.\n\n\u2022National Economic Council Committee on Accurate Data on Nigeria\u2019s Oil Import and Export.\n\n\u2022Agricultural Transformation Implementation Council.\n\n\u2022Sub-Committee on Needs Analysis of Public Universities in Nigeria.\n\n\u2022National Economic Council Review Committee on the Power Sector.\n\nAPC candidate\n\nThe nation is eagerly awiating the candidate of the APC. Some people are predicting it is either going to be Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State and national leader of the party; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, or Ahmad Lawan, Senate president from Yobe State, North East.\n\nAccording to pundits if it is Tinubu, a man who is a specialist in raising men, he would give the country a new direction, despite the thinking of some Nigerians to the contrary. Pundits say that Tinubu, knowing that the government he hatched in 2015 had become a nightmare to Nigerians, would try to right the wrongs by swinging things 360o (degrees). Although it is difficult to point at some establishments by Tinubu, such as flourishing schools, and other businesses that have directly benefited the masses of the country, beyond politics, it is believed that the Jagaban is a creator of wealth and philanthropist. Love him or hate him, Asiwaju is not a push over and he promises to bring his Midas touch to bear on Nigeria\u2019s multifarious maladies from May 29, 2023 when and if he succeeds Buhari. But some analysts are predicting that the power pendulum is likely to swing to Ahmad Lawan. The analysts based their prediction on some of the information garnered that some powerful northern elements insist that Lawan must succeed Buhari since nobody from the North East has tasted the Presidency. A governor of the North West State was quoted as saying that he was not going to buy into such scheme which according to him was against his personal conviction that power should move to the south in the interest of equity and fairness.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo is seriously in the race and he is being touted as the man who the President is holding close to his chest as his preffered successor. Those who think that Osinbajo has the chance couched their analysis from the free hand the President allows him to move across the country on consultation in Presidential Jet and also deploying other resources of state to that advantage. Osinbajo is hoped to galvanise the southern votes as well as pull massive winning votes from the north on account of the influence of the President in the region.\n\nBut it is generally believed that whoever that emerges from the APC primary must get ready for a fierce battle as Atiku and Obi are strong forces to contend with.\n\n\u201cIt makes it easier for Atiku or Obi to win the next election because Buhari\u2019s name is not going to be on the ballot. Yes, he will lend his support, but it is not the same thing as when he was on the card. Do not also forget that the APC will be going to be poll weaker this time around because of the attitude of the party to governance in the last seven years. If Nigerians vote with their conscience, the party has no business coming back to power,\u201d Rufus Ali, a political science lecturer with one of the nation\u2019s private universities, said.\n\nIt is being touted that the APC may choose Lawan to counter-balance the PDP\u2019s Atiku from North East also.\n\n\u201cI think the game plan here is to get someone from Atiku\u2019s zone that would split the northern votes; then the entire south becomes a battle ground. The calculation is that if anybody else is chosen from the south, the north could decide to vote en bloc for Atiku, and this will defeat the mind game the APC has played with the PDP all this while. It is a political calculation and the hand writing is clear on the wall,\u201d Alli said.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC), Nigeria\u2019s ruling party, has delivered far less electricity to homes and businesses than it pledged seven years ago as supply continues to wobble.\n\nThe country\u2019s beleaguered power sector is seen to be moving at a snail\u2019s pace despite over N1.6 trillion interventions by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration, which clocked seven this week.\n\nFor decades, the country has suffered from chronic shortages of power, and repeated promises to fix the problem have long been a staple of election campaigns.\n\nJust like his predecessors, President Buhari won the 2015 presidential election, with a promise to boost power supply in the country.\n\nIn the 2015 APC manifesto seen by BusinessDay, he said, \u201cThe APC government shall vigorously pursue the expansion of electricity generation and distribution of up to 40,000 megawatts in four to eight years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have given ourselves the target of 10,000 megawatts of distributable power. In 2016 alone, we intend to add 2,000 megawatts to the national grid,\u201d President Buhari said while addressing the National Economic Council retreat held at the State House, Abuja on March 21, 2016.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 3,128.5MW as of 6am on Wednesday, with a generation capacity of 7,652.6MW and transmission wheeling capacity of 8,100MW, according to the Nigerian Electricity System Operator (NESO).\n\nThe NESO put the all-time peak generation ever attained in the country at 5,801.6MW,\n\nThe lingering power crisis in the country has forced more people to generate electricity in small units from off-grid sources, usually fossil fuel-powered generators.\n\nAt first glance, the Federal Government\u2019s reforms to improve cash flow and market discipline in the power sector seem to bear tangible fruits.\n\nLast March, Nigerian lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of a constitutional amendment bill aimed at allowing state governments to generate and transmit their own electricity.\n\nTo take advantage of this opportunity, Lagos State is planning to have an autonomous regulatory body while its Lagos Electricity Market plan is expected to be owned and operated substantially by the private sector with an independent system operator to manage new transmission.\n\nAlso, the nine-year tussle between Geometric Power and Interstate Electric that hindered Aba, the commercial hub of Eastern Nigeria, from enjoying a 24-hour power supply, was laid to rest this year as Geometric Power paid $26 million re-acquisition value of the Aba ring-fenced area.\n\nExperts, however, wonder why power generated and made available on the national grid, which was around 2,946.15MW in 2015, currently hovers around 4,000-4,200MW on average despite billions of dollars of investment within the last seven years.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that in 2022 after trillions of dollars have been sunk into the power sector, we still can barely generate 3,500MW,\u201d James Harry, coordinator of the Association of Electricity Customers Monitoring Network, said.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has intervened in the power sector to the tune of N1.6tn.\n\nThe CBN said last week that it released N15.71 billion to power sector players including generation companies and gas companies, under the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading Plc-Payment Assurance Facility, bringing the cumulative disbursement under the facility to N1.30 trillion.\n\nIt said the sum of N22.67 billion was also released to distribution companies (DisCos) for their operational expenditure and capital expenditure, under the Nigeria Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (Phase 2), adding,\n\n\u201cCumulative disbursement under the NEMSF-2 currently stands at N251.93 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, under the National Mass Metering Programme, the bank has disbursed N0.19 billion to DisCos for the procurement of electricity meters, bringing the cumulative disbursement for the procurement and installation of 865,956 meters across the country to N47.82 billion.\u201d\n\nInterventions in energy/infrastructure are designed to improve investment and develop enabling infrastructure in the Nigeria electricity supply industry, the CBN said.\n\n\u201cDespite this level of intervention, the generating companies had estimated receivables of over N400 billion in 2020 alone. While the interventions have been central in ensuring the profitability of operators along the industry\u2019s value chain, they remain insufficient and unsustainable,\u201d noted Augusto & Co.\n\nPedro Omontuemhen, partner and energy, utilities and resources leader at PwC Nigeria, believes so much more is still required to meet Nigeria\u2019s power needs despite the successes achieved within the last seven years.\n\n\u201cThis is a good development, but we are still far away from the required capacity for Nigerians energy needs,\u201d Omontuemhen said. \u201cBetween generation and transmission, Nigeria is losing a lot of power \u2013 9,000MW \u2013 to all sorts of fixable problems.\u201d\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy, is lagging behind some of its peers on the continent in terms of electricity.\n\nEgypt, a country with a population of 104 million inhabitants, added a total of 28,229MW to its national grid between December 2015 and December 2018, resulting in a total installed capacity of 59,000MW.\n\nRead also: Africa requires $35 billion annual investment to meet electricity need \u2013 Sylva\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, this has been achieved through a fast-track project that worked on installing 3,636MW of electricity in eight months worth $2.7 billion.\n\nEgypt also signed another project with Siemens in March 2015, which added 14,400MW in 2.5 years by building three mega combined power cycle stations.\n\nSouth Africa, Africa\u2019s second-biggest economy, has an electricity generation capacity of 58,000MW.\n\n\u201cBy converting old simple cycle power plants to combined cycle, another 1,850MW were installed,\u201d the US report said.\n\nIn Ghana, between 2000 and 2020, electricity generation capacity increased at a rate of 6.4 percent a year from 1,358MW to 4,695MW, according to data from the country\u2019s energy agency.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs to have a holistic review of policy in the power sector,\u201d Ahmad Rufai Zakari, special adviser to the\n\nPresident on Infrastructure, said at PwC\u2019s 12th Annual Power Roundtable event a few weeks ago.\n\nNigeria has a grid generation installed capacity of 13,014.14MW, according to NESO data.\n\n\u201cWithin this same seven to eight years period, backup power supply has doubled, growing exponentially to an estimate of about 40,000mw,\u201d Eyo Ekpo, a former commissioner at the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), told BusinessDay.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that Nigeria\u2019s economy loses about $29 billion a year because of electricity supply problems.\n\n\u201cThe inadequacy of electricity supply is one of the biggest impediments to the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in 2022,\u201d Muda Yusuf, the immediate past director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said.",

          "text": "The discussion over presidential candidacy on Tuesday divided northern All Progressives Congress (APC) governors and their southern counterparts, sources told BusinessDay.\n\nWhile President Muhammadu Buhari had asked the governors to let him choose his successor, the governors are scheming to have one of their own get the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nPresident Buhari, at the meeting with the governors on Tuesday, told them that he would want to pick his successor and needed the governors to support him to do so.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the party and as we approach the convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that the APC governors, after the parley with the president, met first at the Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Abuja and later at the Aso Rock residence of Abdullahi Adamu, the APC national chairman to take a position.\n\nIt was gathered that at the first meeting, which ended in deadlock, the governors were divided on their choice of a presidential candidate.\n\nSources at the meeting hinted that the governors proposed to nominate two of their colleagues, one each for South and North since Buhari had not narrowed his choice to an individual.\n\n\u201cWe believe the president has not settled for any particular person and that is why some governors felt the best thing to do was to nominate two of us (one each from the North and South) to the president for consideration,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, the sources said many northern governors argued that no southern governor could defeat Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, and the North should be given preference.\n\nThe development did not go down well with some southern governors who opposed the position of their northern counterparts \u2013 a development that led to the abrupt end of the meeting without consensus.\n\nReacting to the development, Salihu Lukman, APC national vice chairman, North-west, warned that it would be risky for Buhari to choose a successor without inputs from loyal party leaders and members.\n\nLukman, in an open letter to the President, said the issue was sensitive with very high potential to diminish and damage Buhari\u2019s revered status in the country.\n\n\u201cAny initiative that potentially took away the rights of party members to elect candidates would potentially mobilise Nigerians against the party and rubbish Mr. President,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitical analysts and politicians have warned that the plan by President Buhari to unilaterally choose his successor is capable of undermining democracy and party supremacy in the country.\n\nPundits, who spoke BusinessDay in separate interviews, wondered why the President was talking as if the party was his personal property, saying such an action would be a disregard to APC members across the country who ought to have a say in who emerges as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nThey said his decision to choose the party presidential candidate unilaterally was undemocratic, and an abuse of party supremacy which could lead to implosion in the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nTope Musowo, a political analyst, said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know why Buhari is changing his mind, because he was not so keen on that, but we should not encourage such.\n\n\u201cI know the governors are doing it, but should we now make it a norm? I think his plan is a slap to APC, the other aspirants and it is undemocratic. Does the party belong to him? I hope this does not lead APC into serious imposition ahead of the general election.\u201d\n\nTade Ademola, former Lagos State chairman of Inter-party Advisory Committee, said President Buhari may have been advised wrongly on the issue, saying the plan was contrary to his earlier position not to interfere in who succeeds him.\n\nRead also: Why APC governors are failing to agree on consensus candidate for presidency\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI think some people may be advising Buhari wrongly and it is for their selfish interest, just like they have misled him in the last eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that his government has failed and it is because of such people around him, people who can\u2019t tell him the true situation of things. How about all the delegates? Let\u2019s see how this plan can take the APC.\u201d\n\nEbenezer Babatope, former minister of transport, described President Buhari\u2019s plan as a gamble that may backfire.\n\n\u201cIt is a gamble, he is playing with fire, I don\u2019t think it is democratic, how can you subvert the will of all the delegates and impose your decision on the party?\u201d he said.\n\nKunle Okunade, public affairs commentator, warned that President Buhari\u2019s plan to foist his anointed presidential candidate on the APC may lead to more trouble for the APC ahead next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cDoes he think that other aspirants would be happy and work for his candidate? Why not allow for a contest, even if you have someone in mind,\u201d Okunade said.",

I looked at it and I said, yes, most of the time when we are celebrating anniversaries, we visit orphanage homes and the less privileged and give out to motherless babies and all that.\n\n\u201cBut I said that in line with what I went through in Torino Prison in Italy, I should facilitate the release of some innocent people in Oko prison in Benin who cannot afford either the fine they were given or some of them who were jailed for petty crimes.\u201d\n\nThe ex-commissioner further noted, \u201cWhen I visited the controller of the correctional center in collaboration with the ministry of justice to go through the prisoners\u2019 list, it saddened me to know that somebody spent three months in prison for just N20, 000.\n\n\u201cThat is wickedness; I don\u2019t understand how the justice system works. I am not a lawyer but I think they would have used that kind of a person for community service instead of keeping that person in prison for just N20, 000.\n\n\u201cGoing through the list, we found out that there are people who were sentenced with a fine of N50,000 or two-years imprisonment, N100,000 or three years imprisonment, and N200,000 or three years imprisonment.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine keeping somebody in prison for two years just because of N100, 000. When the person comes back out of that prison how is he going to fit into the system?\n\n\u201cSo, we decided to reach out to friends to raise N2 million and secure the freedom of eight prisoners and for other logistics.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for doctors\u2019 collaboration to sustain reforms in the healthcare sector, ensuring a resilient and equitable system to deliver efficient, quality and affordable healthcare services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the new executives of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Hospital Management Agency, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who noted that he is pursuing a holistic reform in the sector and putting in place mechanisms to discourage manpower for healthcare delivery from leaving the country, urged the doctors to support the government\u2019s effort at strengthening the system and curbing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need more doctors, particularly with the way the doctors are traveling out for greener pastures. What we need is to strengthen the institutions that produce doctors. We are strengthening our educational system to produce more doctors.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is tackling the age-old challenges in the health sector such as dearth of modern medical equipment, decaying healthcare infrastructure, inadequate personnel and poor funding, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe system we inherited and structure put in place at that time was meant for that time but today the society has changed, leading to the reforms in our medical sector. We must rethink the sector we inherited.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMedical healthcare is global and standardized and as such, we need to measure up. We need to restructure our healthcare system in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for us as everyone was restricted from moving around. The lesson is that we must fix our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe have insisted on healthcare reforms. This is why I brought down the central hospital to decentralize the healthcare system in the state, ensuring that there is at least one healthcare facility in every community to ensure healthcare is closer to the people.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on how to produce more doctors by strengthening the basic education system and giving quality education to produce more doctors for the state. We need more than 200 new doctors in the system, who will be in the community to take charge of the PHCs across the state and must be motivated and encouraged to stay here.\u201d\n\nReacting to the doctor\u2019s request to be included in the N40,000 new minimum wage, the governor said, \u201cDoctors are special breeds of civil servants and earn more and should not be asking for minimum wage. You are civil servants but the only set of civil servants who earn more than the governor. A consultant in your system earns twice what I earn as a governor. Why should you be asking for minimum wage? What the government did is to help those at the bottom because people go through a lot every day.\n\n\u201cThe wage is to help those at the bottom to pass the poverty threshold. Certainly, there are allowances due to you but subject to negotiation. We don\u2019t like making promises we cannot fulfill as a government. This is one of the quarrels we have with the federal government. You can\u2019t go and negotiate a labour contract and impose it on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we respect labour which is why we have not had any strike regarding allowances or wages in the state as the welfare of our workers is important to us,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and president of the association, Dr. Uaboi Ovbiagele commended the governor for the holistic reforms in the healthcare sector, pledging their support to sustain reforms in the sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "After a four-month closure due to female Muslim students wearing hijab, the Kwara State Government has announced the reopening of Oyun Baptist High School in Ijagbo for students.\n\nOn Thursday, February 3, 2022, the state administration declared the school closed, stating that it \u201ccondemns the flagrant act of discrimination against anyone, especially minors, on religious grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch discrimination will not be accepted in any state-owned organization,\u201d it went on to say.\n\nMrs Mary Adeosun, the Permanent Secretary in the State Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development, announced the school would return on Friday, June 3, exactly four months after it was closed, in a statement released on Wednesday.\n\nThe government said it would not \u201chesitate to shut the school again, among other things, if anything threatens the safety of the little children\u201d.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Ministry\u2019s decision to reopen the school is one of the government\u2019s multi-prong approaches to return normalcy to the school.\n\n\u201cConsequently, all teachers and students are directed to return to their classrooms while the government white paper committee continues the efforts to address pending issues related to the recent disturbance in the public school.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Ministry restates the government\u2019s position that any Muslim schoolgirl who desires to wear the Hijab is allowed to do so in all public schools, including in Oyun Baptist High School Ijagbo, which is owned by the State Government and run with public resources.\u201d\n\nSome alumni of the school had blamed the government for allegedly failing to act on reports given to it concerning a planned attack on the school.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported that alumni noted that the crisis in the school should have been nipped in the bud because the Kwara State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria had called on the government but there was no response.\n\nThe alumni had demanded that the state government should unravel and unveil the hoodlums and extremists causing a public disturbance in the name of Hijab enforcement.\n\nIn a release sent to SaharaReporters, one of the alumni had said, \u201cOn 2nd February, 2022, we were informed that some Jihadists had mobilised and were ready to destabilise the academic session of OBHS.\n\n\u201cPromptly as early as 6 am, the Ijagbo CAN Chairman called the Chief Imam of Ijagbo of the planned invasion of the OBHS by the fundamentalists, to caution them and await the outcome of the meeting scheduled to hold by 11 am called for by the state government.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, around 6:30 am, without any provocation, the jihadist started shouting \u2018No Hijab, no school\u2019 as they marched in batches to the school.\n\n\u201cA few of them were from Ijagbo, most of them were mercenaries from Offa, Ilorin and a number of them were from Osun State. Even Ijagbo Muslims confirmed that most of the faces at the crisis zone were strange in the community. This is to let the public know how calculated and organised the attack was.\n\n\u201cAll efforts of the Nigeria Police Force, DSS (Department of State Services), and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on the ground to calm these fundamentalists proved abortive.\n\n\u201cThis is history repeating itself. It was in March/April 2021 that a similar Hijab crisis, which is believed to have been sponsored by the people close to and in the government of Kwara State, ensued and resulted in the brutality of some church members and the loss of properties worth millions of naira in Ilorin.\n\n\u201cOyun Baptist High School does not only have a school in it, it has farmlands, a Chapel, and other private properties owned by the proprietor.\u201d\n\nThe alumni raised some posers, saying, \u201cHow did the Government circular on hijab enforcement find its way to Giwa Mosque\u2019s Imam in Offa when churches don\u2019t have a copy? When did Islamic clerics become law enforcement agents in Kwara State? Are the armed Jihadist protesters students of OBHS or parents?\n\n\u201cAre they from the ministry of education? Was permission taken from necessary Security Agents before the so-called peaceful protest was carried out? Why were they armed, attacking and harassing Christians, students and passersby? Who armed them with weapons and walkie-talkies?\u201d",

          "title": "Lukman, APC stakeholders to Buhari: Choose presidential candidate, risk your integrity",
          "text": "There are voices of opposition to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s plea to the governors to support his wish to pick his successor as the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nA number of party stakeholders who spoke against the move said it would not be in the party\u2019s interest to take such decision, saying it could nail the APC\u2019s chances in next year\u2019s poll.\n\nWhat Buhari said\n\nBuhari, had during a meeting with the APC governors Tuesday, begged that he be allowed the privilege of choosing his successor like the governors did in their various states.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the party and as we approach the convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cAllow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens and the global community. Our objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections,\u201d the president had said.\n\nStakeholders kick\n\nLeading the pack of those opposed to the move, a member of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) Mohd Salihu Lukman urged President Buhari to be conscious of his legacies and avoid falling into the temptation of unilaterally picking his successor.\n\nLukman, who is the APC national vice chairman (North-west), gave the advice Wednesday in an open letter to President Buhari in Abuja.\n\nNoting that it would be \u201cdemocratically risky and very costly\u201d to allow the President do so, Lukman urged Buhari not to copy what he described as the anti-democratic credentials of former President Olusegun Obasanjo who foisted his successor, late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua on his Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and allegedly went on to rig the general election to ensure his emergence as President.\n\nThe missive is titled \u201cSuccession and 2023 APC Presidential Candidate: Open Letter to President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nNoting that ordinarily, this should not be a problem as both party members and leaders will always trust the president\u2019s judgment, the APC official however noted that \u201cthe big worry is whether loyal party leaders and members should just reduce themselves to being ordinary observers when very sensitive issues with very high potential to diminish and damage Your Excellency\u2019s revered status in the country is being considered.\u201d\n\nThe former Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) noted that it was important therefore to caution APC to keep faith with basic tenets of democracy as its major campaign message to Nigerians for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThis was eloquently highlighted in Your Excellency\u2019s message to our Progressive Governors when you stated that \u2018the key to electoral successes is the ability to hold consultations and for members to put the nation above other interests.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe temptation for leaders to choose their successors is democratically risky and very costly. If in 2013/2014, Your Excellency could submit yourself to internal democratic processes, it is important that your successor also follows the same process.\n\n\u201cIt may also be necessary to highlight that a major disadvantage with succession arrangement whereby Governors chose their successors is that it negatively affects relationship between the successor and the predecessor, which undermines capacity to influence actions or inactions of successors by their predecessors.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, since the period of negotiating the merger that produced our party APC, I have been a proponent of ensuring that our party takes every step to preserve our leaders who could exercise moral authority.\n\n\u201cThis means that leaders who are highly respected on account of their standing in society should not hold elective or appointive positions.\u201d\n\nOther stakeholders\n\nExpressing similar concern, some APC stakeholders called on the president and the party leadership to allow a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants on the party\u2019s platform.\n\nSpeaking under the aegis of APC National Stakeholders, they warned that anything short of free and fair presidential primaries could spell doom for the party at the 2023 poll.\n\nConvener of the group, Aliyu Audu at a press conference Wednesday in Abuja, said the best legacy President Buhari could leave for the APC and Nigeria as a whole is the legacy of a deeply entrenched democratic process where Nigerians can freely choose who represents them at whatever level in free, fair, credible and transparent processes.\n\nIt decried the infightings among party stalwarts in the aftermath of the states, national assemblies and governorship primaries across the country.\n\nThe group wondered why President Buhari who emerged flag bearer of the party through a free, fair and credibly contested democratic process in 2015 and also won re-election through the same process in 2019, was being tempted to breach the tenets of democracy.\n\n\u201cAt this point in the life of the APC, winning the 2023 presidential election is equally as important as who flies the flag of the party in the election, especially if protecting the legacies that the Muhammadu Buhari led APC administration has put in place in the last 7 years is of great concern.\n\n\u201cWhat guarantees victory for many political is not just who the candidate is, but the process through which they emerge. If the process is flawed so much as to leave members disenchanted, you are already on your way to losing the election.\n\n\u201cFor the APC to avoid finding itself on this path, it must not make the mistake of forcing anyone on the party in whatever guise. The president is free and has the right to have his choice of candidate.\n\n\u201cBut let everyone be made to test their popularity in the field so that representatives of the party in the form of delegates will choose who they deem to be the best, more qualified and popular to win us the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to remind the president that he is supposed to be the moral compass for us as members of the party and Nigerians as a whole.\n\n\u201cAs the president and leader of the party, it is a moral responsibility that he set examples for the governors and future elected leaders to emulate and not the other way round,\u201d they said.\n\nDino weighs in too\u2026\n\nAlso weighing in, a former lawmaker representing Kogi West, Senator Dino Melaye, kicked against the planned move.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Melaye, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), described the request as dictatorial and inhumane.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday the president made a statement that is sacrilegious, unconstitutional, dictatorial and shows some very inhumane tendencies. The president said the governors of APC should support him to choose his successor.\n\n\u201cThe president deliberately used the word successor not flag bearer or candidate of the APC. That statement has some negative import. And the negative concomitant effect is that the president wants to impose a president on Nigerians. We\u2019re in a democracy. We\u2019ll not allow imposition. We\u2019ll not allow the president to handle this country as if we are under a monarchial or hereditary system of government.\n\n\u201cIt is sacrilegious, abominable and undemocratic for the president to talk about a successor in an election that has not been conducted. If he says they should support him to get a candidate, that\u2019s another case.\n\n\u201cSo I am calling the attention of Nigerians to be on the alert. Because the battle to salvage this country from his economic scavengers is a battle of no retreat, no surrender. We\u2019ll not back down to defend our democracy.\u201d\n\nIt could backfire \u2013 Ex-minister\n\nSimilarly, a former Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu said the plan by the president could backfire.\n\nFeaturing on Channels TV, Wednesday, the former minister advised that delegates should be allowed to pick their preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cI will appeal to Mr President to appeal to our governors that they should, as democrats, as progressives, ensure that a level playing field is provided for all aspirants.\n\n\u201cLet delegates from every nook and cranny of this country have an opportunity to make their choices so that Nigerians will see that we are doing better than the other parties.\n\n\u201cWe have had several states in the past where governors attempted to bring in their preferred candidates over and above what is equitable and it has backfired.\n\n\u201cIt is not a standard that we must try to build on. We are a democratic party and the fact that some governors have in the past imposed candidates cannot be a justification for us to continue to perpetuate anti-democratic (acts).\n\n\u201cThey should not bamboozle people, they should not intimidate, they should not do anything that will compromise the right to fairness in bringing in new candidates,\u201d the former minister said.\n\nWhile saying the 2023 election would be different from the previous ones, Shittu said: \u201cIn 2019, it was essentially a two-party affair but this year, with what we have seen with the NNPP coming up, with Labour Party coming up with a very strong candidate in Peter Obi, we must appreciate that actions will naturally have consequences.\n\n\u201cWe must learn from our circumstances, we must learn from our environment and know that it may not be as easy as we think. We must also be warned now that the youths are coming up, stronger and more agitated for change.\n\n\u201cWe must be able to give the impression to the general public, particularly the youths, that we are being fair to all aspirants and that as democrats, as progressives, we are not giving the impression that some people are being over-pampered above others.\u201d\n\nArewa youth want Osinbajo\n\nAmidst the growing opposition to the president\u2019s position, the Arewa Youth and Women group has urged Buhari to pick Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nSpeaking under the auspices of Coalition of Arewa Youth and Women for PY0 2023, the group said Osinbajo is the best man for the job and should be handed the mantle of leadership, having performed creditably well when he was entrusted with the role in acting capacity during President Buhari\u2019s medical leave of absence.\n\nSpeaking through their spokesman, Mohammed Lawal, the group said: \u201cHaving solicited that he wants to pick his successor, President Buhari should be given all the support to do that since he knows best the challenges facing Nigeria, just as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo equally knows well what the challenges are and would hit the ground running if given the chance rather than other aspirants who may not know where to start since they are not exposed to the full gamut of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe phrase \u201cI solicit your support in picking my successor\u201d is certainly a divine voice guiding the president to steer in the right direction and hand over the mantle of leadership to the best man for the job. Though there are many presidential aspirants, only one of them is standing taller, more competent, accepted, tested and trusted. A man who has been president in acting capacity, a professor of Law, an investment Ceasar and exceptional political breed of rare kind.\n\n\u201cVice President, Yemi Osinbajo is a favorite in line of aspirants to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. His previous antecedents that says much about him, record breaking performances that have earned him nothing other than an unadulterated respect, love, reverence and admiration by the people.\n\n\u201cAcross Nigeria, from North to South, East to West you find Professor Yemi Osinbajo with the Muslims and Christians, Hausas, Yoruba, Igbo, Igede, Idoma, Ibibio, Ekwere, Ishakiri and others for unity, peace and development to prevail in Nigeria. He is a detribalised Nigerian, a man who is only defined by his humanity, philanthropy and respect for all irrespective of tribe, religion and political affiliation, indeed, a symbol of national unity.\n\n\u201cA leader with impeccable qualities of leadership, one of the best and rare politicians of our time. This intelligent pillar of hope, vibrant, discipline leader and bulldozer of work has a vast wealth of knowledge and experience.

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential candidate and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar said his emergence is a victory for the party and Nigerians.\n\nThe Wazirin Adamawa, who stated this shortly after he was presented a certificate of return on Wednesday in Abuja, cautioned that in the race to win the 2023 presidential election nobody should be excluded.\n\nAtiku said: \u201cI am honoured and humbled to receive this certificate of Return having emerged as our party\u2019s candidate in our just concluded special convention. This victory is a victory for all of us, for our party, and the vast majority of Nigerians suffering under the misrule of the APC.\u201d\n\nThe 2019 PDP presidential candidate, who attributed his emergence to collective effort, thanked the Convention National Organising Committee led by former Senate President David Mark, for a rancour-free and successful convention.\n\nThe former vice president also thanked the National Working Committee (NWC) for providing the right leadership provided the party.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI am particularly grateful that you kept your word and gave us contestants fair treatment, despite what might have been a difficult situation. Your integrity and even handedness must be commended.\n\n\u201cMy chairman, my dear friends, while I\u2019m excited and happy for this opportunity to bear our party\u2019s flag again, let us all remember that what just happened is a contest within a family to decide how to put our best foot forward.\n\n\u201cThe main contest is the one to win the presidency of our country for our party. It will require the entire PDP family and other supporters and sympathisers. We must pull everyone together. Nobody should be excluded, I beg of you.\n\n\u201cI have already visited some of those who contested against me, as a way to lead in that effort to unify the party so that we can face our real opponents, defeat them in the elections and begin the process of rescuing and rebuilding this country from the colours and dangerous APC misrule over the past seven years which is there for everyone to see.\n\n\u201cHowever, we should not take that or their defeat for granted. We must unite and work extremely hard for every single vote in this country. There is so much to do\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, assured that a united party would take over power from a colourless, clueless All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithin the PDP family, we had a minor contest, a small contest within the family. There were no victors, there were no vanquished, and the party won. It is the party that won. Atiku Abubakar is not yet victorious. He has only been produced as our candidate, the candidate of the whole party.\n\n\u201cAs we march forward, we need all of you because each one of you had a supporter and all of you plus all your supporters, we want you all to fuse into one happy political family.\n\n\u201cIt is this family that will face the battle ahead. We have only started a journey. We shall end this journey sometime next year. By the first of June next year, we should take over power from the colourless and clueless government that has destroyed this country.\n\n\u201cAll of you are aware of what has happened to our country in the last seven years. I don\u2019t need to repeat issues of insecurity, destruction of the economy, total disunity of the country.\n\n\u201cWe have never been as divided as we are today as a country. Families are divided, and communities are divided against each other. There is no trust among ourselves.\u201d\n\nHe assured that a PDP government that will be led by Atiku is coming is tested and trusted, saying \u201che will lead us to reunite the country. He will lead us to rebuild the economy. He will lead us to get rid of bandits and terrorists. He will re-enforce the armed forces. He will give us respect in the international community.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "First Bank of Nigeria Limited offers different range of products to support the agric business in its efforts to grow the nation\u2019s economy. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at the bank\u2019s products targeted at growing agricultural business in the country.\n\nGlobally, the agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in the development of the economy of every country. The Nigeria agricultural policy provides among others, the adequate financing of agriculture. The primary goal of agricultural financing policies in Nigeria is to establish an efficient system of sustainable agricultural financing schemes, programme and institutions which could provide micro and macro credit facilities for the small , medium and large scale producers, processors as well as marketers.\n\nSupport for agriculture is widely driven by the public sector, which has established institutional support in form of agricultural research extension, commodity marketing , input supply, land use legislation to fast track development of agriculture in the country.\n\nBut successive governents in Nigeria at the federal, state and local levels have not been able to adequately address the specific constrains affecting the sector in an attempt to increase agricultural production in the country.\n\nAlthough, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through its intervention funds and other schemes such as Anchor borrower, Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme among others has impacted positively to the growth of agricultural sector, but it is not enough for the sector to make significant contribution to net foreign exchange earnings for the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\nBenefits of agriculture\n\nAgriculture contributes immensely to the nation\u2019s economy in various ways. The sector provides food for the increasing population, supply adequate raw materials, land labour input to a growing industrial sector, a major source of employment, generation of foreign exchange earnings and provision of market for the products of the industrial sector.\n\nThe sector contributes 40 per cent of the Gross Domestic Products and employ about 70 per cent of the working population in Nigeria.

The fund comprises the short tenured working capital for 12 months as well as importation of plants & machinery for processing of exportable goods at all-in-interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. It is meant to improve export financing, increase access of exporters to low interest credit and offer additional opportunities for them to upscale and expand their businesses in addition to improving their competitiveness.\n\nFeatures/ target market\n\nThe fund has lending Limit of 70 per cent of the total cost of the project or transaction subject to a limit of N5 billion with a maximum single digit interest rate of 9 per cent, single obligor limit of up to N5 billion and fund will be available till 2027.\n\nAccording to available data from FirstBank\u2019s website, the eligible transactions that shall qualify for funding under the NESF shall include:export of goods processed or manufactured in Nigeria, export of commodities and services, which are allowed under the laws of Nigeria.\n\nImports of plant & machinery, spare parts and packaging materials required for export-oriented production that cannot be sourced locally, resuscitation, expansion, modernisation and technology upgrade of non-oil export.\n\nOthers are export value chain support services such as transportation, warehousing and quality assurance infrastructure, working capital/stocking facility, and structured trade finance arrangements.\n\nExport Facilitation Initiative (EFI).\n\nThe funding is to increase capacity in the industry for export and foreign exchange generation.

Following our priority as a continuous financier of credit worthy agro-allied businesses, our team of dedicated agricultural professionals specialising in various fields of agriculture are strategically located to identify and support agricultural enterprises covering across all regions of Nigeria, with a suite of customised sector and customer friendly agricultural financing solutions.\n\n\u201cFirstBank has a large base of existing small, medium and commercial agribusiness clients across Nigeria operating in all segments of the agricultural value chain covering primary production, storage, processing, packaging and agro export, amongst others\u201d.\n\nAdeduntan said that in partnership with public sector institutions, the bank has supported several state governments on agricultural development trust fund scheme, an initiative designed to provide credit facilities to small scale farmers who do not have collateral.\n\n\u201cIndeed, under the Federal Government\u2019s Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme for long tenored credit facilities to commercial agricultural enterprises \u2013 at single digit interest rate \u2013 FirstBank has supported over 23 per cent of all the enterprises supported by all the banks put together. The projects spread across input supplies, primary production, processing and marketing. Obligors include small, medium and large scale enterprise in the agricultural value chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am happy that with these experiences, FirstBank worked immensely to support the Central Bank of Nigeria in actualizing the efforts of reviving all the value\u2013chains as envisioned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition, following the policy for playing down on importation of some of the commodities and encouragement of exportation of agricultural commodities, FirstBank is at the forefront of adopting the supportive schemes newly introduced by the Central Bank, like the Non-Oil Export Stimulation Facilities (NESF)\u201d, he concluded.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Customs HC Project Limited was expected to last for 36 months, to enhance the agency\u2019s mode of operation using the application of information and technology in all aspects of its administration.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of this project is to completely automate every aspect of the customs business and to institutionalize the use of smart and emerging technologies that will enhanced the statutory function of the Nigerian Customs Service in the areas of revenue generation as well as trade facilitation and enhancement of security,\u201d the Minister of Finance and Budget Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had told State House Correspondents shortly after the meeting in 2020.\n\nAhmed had explained that was to be financed by sponsors \u201cwho will in return look over the investment in the concessionary period of 20 years\u201d while it has the potential to generate up to $176 billion for the country.\n\n\u201cSo this investment of $3.1 billion is broken down into capital investment of $1.2 million which will be done in three phases over 36 months by these investors and $1.1 million is our projection of the operational cost over the 20-year period of the implementation of this project.\n\n\u201cThis project has the potential to yield up to $176 billion of revenue for the project and the consortia that are providing this investment are going to be paid over time according to the schedule that is negotiated for their investments including their profits and cost,\u201d she had said.\n\nAsked to explain the rationale behind a new e-Customs concession agreement between the NCS, Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Limited, Ahmed said: \u201cThe E-customs project was approved by Council.

          "text": "By our correspondent\n\nNew Materials Nigeria Company, a building material company recently commissioned in the Kuje area of Abuja will save Nigeria a whopping sum of $100m in foreign exchange annually when fully operational, its Managing Director, Mr. Jackie Dai Hui has said.\n\nBriefing newsmen on the advantages of establishing the company in Nigeria, Mr. Jackie said it is estimated that when the company which produces Fiber Cement Board reaches its peak of about five million square meters annually; it would help the federal government save $100m in foreign exchange.\n\nHe explained that if the New Materials Nigeria Company succeeds, it will, within 10 years, invest in more companies and product lines especially in the area of production of Gypsum and Solar panels for alternative power generation.\n\nSpeaking further, the Managing Director said that so far, over $50 million has been invested in the New Materials Nigeria Company explaining that in no distant time, it will grow its investment in Nigeria by establishing a branch in Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the New Materials Nigeria Company has gone a long way to provide employment to 150 Nigerians both at senior and junior levels who he said are also being trained in various skills.\n\n\u201cWe have management and junior staff. Our Human Resource Manager is Nigerian; our Office Manager is a Nigerian and our Shift Leader also is a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThese are top management positions. We train Nigerians to run the company; we are transferring technology to those who are brilliant. Today you may see some Chinese but next time you come you won\u2019t see Chinese, you will only see Nigerians here.\n\n\u201cWe want to share. Not like other foreign companies where all the top management staff are foreigners and Nigerians left to do the labour work. We have moved beyond that.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat Nigerians who have the desire to work with our company well and encourage them to build a career. We have administrators, we have technicians, we have general labour, we have managers and we have shift leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning, later we will give them more platforms, maybe one day when we have branches in Kano, ECOWAS countries like Cameroun; we can send Nigerians there to be Directors. This is what we do. We grow together for a shared future. Right now, we have up to 150 staff but less than 20 are Chinese, the others are Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo for this factory, we are not only like a factory or company, we are also like a university. We sum it as a work chance or skill platform for local persons. We can train people. In a year, we can train a number of people that would contribute to the building of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe can increase our company\u2019s presence in Nigeria because we can source all our raw materials in Nigeria. And also we can make analysis for Nigeria building material markets. So, this product is new material but it has more advantages and so we have confidence. At the end of this year I am sure we will see good results.\n\n\u201cLet me add that the first person to come to Nigeria from our company didn\u2019t know what Fiber Cement Board was, but now we all know and we all love the product. I have confidence in Nigeria. As Eric, the Deputy Managing Director said, we want to work with universities to do some research about our product. We can share the platform for people to learn more in Universities and Polytechnics; we can share knowledge\u201d, Mr. Jackie added.\n\nOn Corporate Social Responsibility, he said the company has built roads for the host communities, built boreholes to help them have access to clean water; and rehabilitated some schools and roofing sheets for some of their buildings.",

          "title": "\u2018Fuel on Fire\u2019: US and Germany Agree to Supply Advanced Weapons to Ukraine",
          "text": "The U.S. and Germany pledged Wednesday to equip Ukraine with some of the advanced weapons it has long desired for shooting down aircraft and knocking out artillery, as Russian forces closed in on capturing a key city in the east.\n\nGermany said it will supply Ukraine with up-to-date anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems, while the U.S. announced it will provide four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition.\n\nThe U.S. is trying to help Ukraine fend off the Russians without triggering a wider war in Europe. The Pentagon said it received assurances that Ukraine will not fire the new rockets into Russian territory.\n\nThe Kremlin accused the U.S. of \u201cpouring fuel on the fire.\u201d\n\nWestern arms have been critical to Ukraine\u2019s success in stymieing Russia\u2019s much larger and better-equipped military, thwarting its effort to storm the capital and forcing Moscow to shift its focus to the industrial Donbas region in the east.\n\nBut as Russia bombards towns in its inching advance in the east, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly pleaded for more and better weapons and accused the West of moving too slowly.\n\nAndriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, hailed the new Western weapons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that if we receive all the necessary weapons and strengthen the efficient sanctions regime we will win,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new arms could help Ukraine set up and hold new lines of defense in the east by hitting back at Russian artillery pieces that have been battering towns and cities and by limiting Russian airstrikes, said retired French Gen. Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France\u2019s military mission at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe NATO countries \u2014 the European nations and the Americans \u2014 have progressively escalated the means that they are putting at Ukraine\u2019s disposal, and this escalation, in my opinion, has had the aim of testing Russian limits,\u201d he said. \u201cEach time, they measure the Russian reaction, and since there is no reaction, they keep supplying increasingly effective and sophisticated weaponry.\u201d\n\nMilitary analysts say Russia is hoping to overrun the Donbas before any weapons that might turn the tide arrive. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision U.S. weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. But Defense Undersecretary Colin Kahl said he believes they will arrive in time to make a difference in the fight.\n\nThe rocket systems are part of a new $700 million package of security assistance for Ukraine from the U.S. that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.\n\nThe rockets have a range of about 50 miles (80 kilometers) and are highly mobile. Ukraine had pushed unsuccessfully for rockets with a range of up to 186 miles (300 kilometers).\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow does not trust assurances that Ukraine will not fire on Russian territory. \u201cWe believe that the U.S. is deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire,\u201d he said.\n\nCol. Gen. Mikhail Mizintzev later went further, directly accusing Ukraine of planning to fire U.S.-provided missiles from the northeastern Sumy region at border areas in Russia. The claim, which he said was based on radio intercepts, couldn\u2019t be independently confirmed.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine\u2019s push for more weapons is a \u201cdirect provocation intended to draw the West into the fighting.\u201d He warned that the multiple rocket launchers would raise the risk of an expanded conflict.\n\n\u201cSane Western politicians understand those risks well,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the new weapons shipments were announced, a Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Regional Gov. Maksym Kozytskyy said five people were wounded in Wednesday\u2019s strike, and the head of Ukrainian railways said the damage was still being assessed.\n\nGermany\u2019s promise of IRIS-T air defense systems would mark the first delivery of long-range air defense weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war. Earlier deliveries of portable, shoulder-fired air defense missiles have bolstered the Ukrainian military\u2019s ability to take down helicopters and other low-flying aircraft but didn\u2019t give it enough range to challenge Russia\u2019s air superiority.\n\nGermany has come under particular criticism, both at home and from allies abroad, that it isn\u2019t doing enough. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T\u2019s surface-to-air missiles are the most modern air defense system the country has.\n\n\u201cWith this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,\u201d he said. The radar systems will also help Ukraine locate enemy artillery.\n\nA regional governor said Russian forces now control 80% of Sievierodonetsk, a city that is key to Moscow\u2019s efforts to complete its capture of the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists have fought for years and where the separatists held swaths of territory even before the invasion.\n\nLuhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Russian troops were advancing in the city during fierce street battles with Ukrainian forces, though he noted that in some districts the Ukrainian troops managed to push them back.\n\nThe only other city in Luhansk that the Russians have not yet captured, Lysychansk, is still fully under Ukrainian control, he said, but is likely to be the next target. The two cities are separated by a river.\n\n\u201cIf the Russians manage to take full control over Sievierodonetsk within two to three days, they will start installing artillery and mortars and will shell Lysychansk more intensively,\u201d Haidai said.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said the country is losing between 60 and 100 soldiers a day in the fighting.\n\nHe turned the focus to children in his nightly video address, saying 243 of them have been killed in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing. The real numbers could be higher, he added, as his government doesn\u2019t have a full picture of areas under Russian occupation.\n\nZelenskyy also said 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully taken to Russia and dispersed across that vast country: \u201cThe purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return.\u201d\n\nIn southern Ukraine, a regional governor sounded a more positive note, saying Russian troops were retreating and blowing up bridges behind them.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid of a counterattack by the Ukrainian army,\u201d Vitaliy Kim, governor of the Mykolayiv region, said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nAP",
          "summary": "Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, hailed the new Western weapons.\nAs the new weapons shipments were announced, a Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies, officials said.\nGermany\u2019s promise of IRIS-T air defense systems would mark the first delivery of long-range air defense weapons to Ukraine since the start of the war.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz told lawmakers that the IRIS-T\u2019s surface-to-air missiles are the most modern air defense system the country has.\n\u201cWith this, we will enable Ukraine to defend an entire city from Russian air attacks,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Argentina marked the revival of the Cup of Champions in style as they outclassed Italy 3-0 in a heavyweight clash billed as the \u201cFinalissima\u201d at a raucous Wembley Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nFirst-half goals by Lautaro Martinez and Angel Di Maria put the south American champions in complete control against an Italy side who were back at Wembley 11 months after beating England to win the delayed Euro 2020.\n\nWith thousands of their supporters in the 87,000 crowd determined to turn northwest London into Buenos Aires for the night, an Argentina side including Lionel Messi was simply too quick and slick for the lumbering Azzurri.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful final, full of Argentinians. What we\u2019ve experienced here was beautiful. We knew it was going to be an attractive game and a nice setting to be champion,\u201d Messi said after the match. \u201cWe can compete against anyone. Today it was a good test because Italy is a great team.\u201d\n\nMartinez tapped home from close range in the 28th minute from Messi\u2019s low cross to reward Argentina\u2019s early dominance.\n\n\u201cThis is priceless. We are extremely happy for how things are going, for our play and for what this group is,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThere are still several months to go before the World Cup and we know we need to correct certain things.\u201d\n\nInter Milan\u2019s Martinez then slid a pass through for Di Maria to double the lead with a dinked finish on the stroke of half-time to send the South American fans into raptures.\n\nArgentina could have scored plenty more after the break with Messi pulling the strings and Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma sparing his side a drubbing.\n\nSubstitute Paulo Dybala underlined Argentina\u2019s superiority with a drilled low finish in stoppage time.\n\nIt was a disappointing end to Italy stalwart defender Giorgio Chiellini\u2019s international career as the 37-year-old was substituted at half-time on his 117th and final appearance.\n\nThe Finalissima is the revival of the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions that has been played only twice before, in 1985 and 1993.\n\nMessi, who lit up the evening with a series of trademark dribbles, was hoisted into the air by his team mates who danced jigs of joy on the lush Wembley turf.\n\nArgentina, who ended a 28-year wait for a trophy by beating Brazil to win the 2021 Copa America, produced a display that augurs well for their hopes at the Qatar World Cup this year, extending their unbeaten run to 32 games.\n\n\u201cEverything changed since we won the Copa America,\u201d Di Maria said. \u201cWe got rid of that weight and now we are enjoying playing, having a good time and things are much easier for us. We are enthusiastic, but we must always keep our feet on the ground.\u201d\n\nFor Italy, it was a sobering reminder of just how quickly fortunes can change in football.\n\nLast July, Roberto Mancini\u2019s team were euphoric after a penalty shootout win over England to win the European Championship, but have since suffered the humiliation of failing to qualify for the World Cup for the second successive tournament after losing in a playoff to North Macedonia.\n\nIn the build-up Mancini described game as the \u201cend of a cycle\u201d and the defeat left him in no doubt as to how much work is required to revive Italy\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cThey were better than us. We were in the game in the first half but didn\u2019t do enough to turn it around after the break,\u201d Mancini said.\n\nESPN",

          "text": "A man armed with a rifle and a handgun killed four people inside a medical building in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Wednesday before fatally shooting himself, police said, in the latest of a series of mass shootings to rattle the United States.\n\nEyewitness video of first responders arriving at the St. Francis Hospital campus showed a police officer immediately pulling a high powered rifle from the boot of his car. Armed police then ran towards the medical centre.\n\nPolice arrived at the medical center three minutes after receiving a call about the shooting on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPolice then followed the sound of gunfire up to the Natalie Building\u2019s second floor, Tulsa deputy police chief Eric Dalgleish told reporters.\n\nThe officers made contact with the victims and the suspect five minutes later, Dalgleish said.\n\nPolice responses have come under increased scrutiny after a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers in a Texas school classroom last week while officers waited outside for nearly an hour.\n\nAsked by reporters whether police had refreshed training or thinking about active shooters after the Uvalde, Texas school shooting, Dalgleish said: \u201cI think that\u2019s probably fresh on everyone\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say Tulsa revisits that topic regularly. I was very happy with what we know so far regarding the response of our officers,\u201d Dalgleish said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s incident in Tulsa came on the heels of mass shootings that have re-ignited debates about gun control. Two weeks before the Uvalde shooting, a white gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York.\n\nPolice in Tulsa said they were trying to determine the suspect\u2019s identity, who they estimated was aged between 35 and 40, and had no details yet on his motive.\n\nThe Natalie Building contains doctors\u2019 offices including an orthopedic center, Dalgleish said, adding he believed the victims included employees and patients.\n\nThe White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting and offered support to state and local officials in Tulsa, a city of some 411,000 people that sits around 100 miles (160 km) northeast of the capital Oklahoma City.\n\nReuters",

The historic residence\u2019s famous Round Tower is visible in the distance.\n\nMr Mackechnie took two previous portraits of the Queen alongside the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George to mark her 90th birthday in 2016.\n\nIn her Jubilee message the monarch said: \u201cI continue to be inspired by the goodwill shown to me, and hope that the coming days will provide an opportunity to reflect on all that has been achieved during the last 70 years, as we look to the future with confidence and enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nThe traditional Trooping the Colour parade to mark the Queen\u2019s official birthday will involve more than 1,500 officers and soldiers and 350 horses from the Household Division, as well as an RAF flypast.\n\nThe 96-year-old monarch, who has mobility issues and has recently cancelled several public appearances, is likely to join members of the Royal Family on the balcony at Buckingham Palace to watch the display.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will watch the parade, although they will not appear on the balcony.\n\nThe couple, who now live in the US, will have a prime vantage point from the Duke of Wellington\u2019s former office, overlooking Horse Guards Parade, where they will watch Prince Charles inspect the guardsmen and officers and take their salute in his mother\u2019s place.\n\nThey are travelling with their children Archie, three, and Lilibet, who turns one on Saturday. Lilibet is the Queen\u2019s family nickname.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s son Prince Andrew, whose royal titles were returned to the Crown amid a lawsuit in the US, will not be present\n\nOn Thursday evening, more than 3,000 beacons will be lit across the UK and the Commonwealth in tribute to the Queen, with the Tree of Trees beacon illuminated outside the palace.\n\nThe monarch is to lead the lighting of the principal Jubilee beacon in a special ceremony at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said.\n\nAlso on Thursday the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will guest star in an episode of TV soap EastEnders, on BBC One at 19:30 BST.\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla join the residents of Albert Square at their jubilee street party.\n\nAt a service of thanksgiving at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral on Friday, there will be other accommodations made for the Queen\u2019s comfort, with no ceremonial journey to the event.\n\nIf the monarch does attend, she will use a different entrance rather than scaling the steps.\n\nAnd it is not certain she will make the planned trip to Epsom for the Derby on Saturday.\n\nOn that evening, the BBC\u2019s Party at the Palace concert \u2013 set on three stages in front of Buckingham Palace \u2013 will see Diana Ross, George Ezra, Alicia Keys and Nile Rodgers entertain a live crowd of 22,000 people and a television audience of millions.\n\nAt the concert, heir to the throne Prince Charles and his son, the Duke of Cambridge, will pay tribute to the Queen who will be watching on television.\n\nOn Sunday there will be street parties, picnics and barbecues across the UK with more than 85,000 Big Jubilee Lunches planned.\n\nThe finale of the weekend will be the Jubilee Pageant which will make its way through the streets of the capital with a cast of 6,000 performers and close to 200 celebrities.\n\nIt will end with Ed Sheeran singing the national anthem with a choir made up of \u201cnational treasures\u201d outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nAhead of the celebrations, the Queen took a short break at Balmoral Castle, in Aberdeenshire, but returned to Windsor on Tuesday.\n\nSaturday is the first birthday of Harry and Meghan\u2019s daughter Lilibet \u2013 who is named after the Queen\u2019s family nickname.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s granddaughter Princess Eugenie has led tributes to her in an article in the Spectator, describing her \u201cgrannie\u201d as \u201ca woman who has transcended time and has been that constant rock for so many when the world can feel so fragile\u201d.\n\nShe said she would love her son August to \u201chave her patience, her calmness and her kindness, while always being able to laugh at himself and keep a twinkle in his eye\u201d.\n\nScotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the monarch on a \u201clifetime of service\u201d and urged all Scots to mark her \u201cvalues of integrity, wisdom, justice and compassion\u201d \u2013 regardless of their views on the British monarchy.\n\nNot everyone will be celebrating the occasion. Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic said a recent poll had shown the British public \u201cjust aren\u2019t that bothered about royal events\u201d.\n\nSpeaking for the group, Graham Smith said: \u201cThe Jubilee is not a national celebration, it is a carefully staged event to promote the monarchy and the royal brand.\u201d\n\nBBC",

Sued along with them was one Salamatu Aliyu and the NLC.\n\nThe court in its order issued on Monday, had ordered a, \u201csubstituted service of the originating summons, interlocutory injunction, and all other processes in this suit on the 1st to 3rd, 6th to 12th and 14th defendants by pasting the said processes at their political party\u2019s office, which is the 5th defendant\u2019s office, located at No 2, Oke Agbe Street, Off Ladoke Akintoal Boulevard, Garki 11, Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe 1st to 3rd defendants are Abure, Farouq and Oyelakin.

He had explained that he got the post by virtue of his position as Deputy National Chairman of the party when the late National Chairman, Abdulsalam, was in office. He added that Abure, who is currently leading a faction of the party, was then Acting National Secretary, when Abdulsalam, died in 2020.\n\nOkafor had further claimed that Abure announced himself as National Chairman without recourse to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution, following Abdulsalam\u2019s demise.
