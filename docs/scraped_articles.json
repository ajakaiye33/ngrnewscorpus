          "text": "The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, says the Federal Government is determined to make a bold step on vaccines production in the country.\n\nEhanire said this on Friday in Abuja at the special National Council on Health meeting organised by the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that the 2014 National Health Act recognises the NCH as the highest policy-making body within the Nigerian health sector.\n\nThe minister noted that the vaccine urgency was not just for COVID-19 adding that no one knew what was coming in the future.\n\nEhanire stated that as the country responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigerians must not believe that the pandemic was over.\n\nHe added that the detection of the Omicron variant should teach anyone that the virus keeps surprising the world.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must not let down our guards. We must continue with our non-pharmaceutical interventions, the public health measures that are advised. We can\u2019t do away with them. They are the most secure and the cheapest ways to protect ourselves and our loved ones.\u201d\n\nThe minister disclosed that the Federal Government was preparing to build one oxygen production plant in every state, while two would be in Lagos because of its high demand and one in the FCT.\n\n\u201cOxygen should be available even at the primary healthcare centres, not just for COVID-19 but for other health emergencies,\u201d he added.\n\nA former Minister of Health, Prof. Onyebuchi Chukwu, said before the COVID-19 pandemic, India was producing 50 per cent of the world\u2019s need for vaccines.\n\nChukwu noted that India shared similar demographics with Nigeria and could teach the nation a number of lessons.\n\nThe minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, said Africa had suffered so much in terms of COVID-19 vaccines distributions.\n\nHe added that it was time for the continent to come together and start manufacturing the vaccines, given the global inequity in the COVID-19 vaccine distributions.\n\nThe World Health Organisation representative in Nigeria, Dr Walter Kazadi Mulombo, said health should be considered as an enabler for economic development.\n\nIn another development, the Senate on Friday assured Nigerians that the Covid-19 vaccines they had taken was capable of preventing them from contracting the Omicron variant of the disease.\n\nThe Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Senator Ibrahim Oloriegbe, a medical doctor, gave the assurance in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja.\n\nOloriegbe explained that investigations conducted in southern African countries had revealed that those infected with the Omicron variant had yet to be vaccinated.\n\nHe also said placing of travel bans on countries where the variant had been discovered was unnecessary.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We want to farm on our land. We are not lazy youths and we are ready to farm if they allow us to use our land. If they take our land that simply means we are finished because it would amount to debasing us to strangers in our own land.\n\n\u201cThey came to our community and met with our fathers that they wanted to buy land but nothing was paid and now we are saying we don\u2019t want to sell again.\n\n\u201cEach time we raise our voice over the land matter, they go after us, arresting our youths and detaining them. They have even arrested His Royal Eminence, Ikwele of Ibuzor Kingdom and this is a slap on Ibuzor people.\n\n\u201cWhen they approached our fathers over this land that they wanted to build barrack, there was less population in this community. It turned out to be deception because, for about twenty years after, nothing was paid in form of compensation and the land is there wasting away even when we don\u2019t have enough land for farming\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, an elderly member of the community, 82-years old Diokpa Paul Ijeh recalled that they were told police wanted to acquire the land but nothing concrete was done to acquire the said land.\n\nDiokpa Ijeh, who claimed the land belong to him and his fore fathers, noted with regret that the land used to fetch him some money through leasing but presently, due to the police involvement he had been denied of such income.\n\nContacted, Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Bright Edafe declined comment on the matter, saying he needed to look into the issue property before he could make any comment.\n\nAlso contacted, the Commissioner for Land and Survey, Kate Onianwa disclosed that the state government procured land for the state Police Command about 20 years ago, adding that preparations toward payment of compensation for the said land had reached an advanced stage.",

I know the role UPU is playing in helping to build peace in Urhobo land and trying to extend hands of friendship across the state and by time our people in Delta State are able to relate as one, it will help government to solve it\u2019s problems,\u201d he said.\n\nThanking the Urhobo traditional rulers for the support they had continued to give to the UPU and the state government, he commended the union for honouring sons and daughters of the Urhobo nation who had excelled in various aspects of life. \u201cWhen people are recognized, it is a call for those who are growing up to do more for the nation\u201d, he added.\n\nOn the 2023 governorship election in the state, Okowa expressed happiness with the peaceful manner and respect for each other with which the lobby groups seeking the gubernatorial seat had been going about their aspiration.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we continue to extend our hands of cooperation, l am foreseeing a peaceful coexistence and very soon, we will sit down at the roundtable and talk to ourselves because we want a state that will remain stable.\u201d\n\nAdvising those vying for the governorship position to be mindful of the choice of words in public places to avoid crisis, he advised the Urhobo people to prune down the number of their aspirants.\n\n\u201cWhen there are too many sons and daughters in a race, it creates a lot of challenges. There is the need to trim down and l believe the time is now,\u201d he said.\n\nReiterating the determination of his administration to remain focused on its goals through 2023, he said \u201cwe are better off as a united people, we are better off talking to each other and better off respecting each other.\u201d\n\nEarlier, President-General of the UPU, Olorogun Moses Taiga noted that the union was the oldest surviving socio- cultural organization in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur forebears stoke the embers of cultural nationalism and as deftly as possible put the UPU on a pedestal that insulated it from the murky waters of politics.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that \u201cNigeria, nay Urhobo of today is confronted by hydra-headed impediments that we must brace up to combat. We are assailed from within and outside.\n\n\u201cUrhobo is part of the global current of disillusionment and we must like others also embark on the quest for a new social order to attain the essence of the redemptive strides the founders of the UPU envisaged for the Urhobo people ninety years ago.\n\n\u201cJust as our forebears did in 1931 when they engaged the times in which they lived, we the Urhobo of 2021 must also interrogate our today and contemplate our tomorrow and begin to work our way through the currents of hope and land at the shores of the Promised Land.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the ethnic nationalities that felicitated with the UPU on the anniversary, saying, \u201cwe cherish our cultural and fraternal bond.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has said that the exclusion of state high court from prosecuting drug peddlers is responsible for the delay in bringing offenders to answer for their crimes in the state.\n\nAccording to Masari, allowing only federal courts to try the numerous cases from the narcotic agencies, aside causing the trial to tarry, also accounts for why there are only few cases of prosecuted drug peddlers in the state.\n\nMasari made the remark when the new commandant of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency in the state, Muhammed Ibrahim, paid him a courtesy call at the state government house on Thursday.\n\nWhile querying the granting of bail to drug offenders, Governor Masari urged the agency to look inward and see how they can reinforce their position. He said, \u201cthere are certain categories of offenders that should not be given bail and their offences should be part of capital offences that cannot be granted bail. It doesn\u2019t make sense granting bail to drug dealers, though a consumer is different from a dealer. You can\u2019t release an arm robber on bail but what about a drug dealer who is more dangerous than an armed robber?\n\nConsequently, he said there is the need to review the narcotic laws to empower state high courts as well to prosecute drug offenders.\n\n\u201cWe are also ready to help when it comes to amendment of your legislation or even the Constitution so that the state can be given a role to play in prosecuting them. As it is right now, we are handicapped. Our role is limited to logistics. We have become chief logistics officers of the state and not chief security officers.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cthe clamour for state court to be included in the prosecution of drug dealers in the state will give them special interest to ensure that offenders are prosecuted in good time. But when you take them to Federal High Court, the lawyers would go there and bail them saying that it is a bailable offence. How can you give bail to a drug dealer who is more dangerous than a bandit? Without drug dealers, drug suppliers, there won\u2019t be consumption of drugs and it will help to fight this issue of terrorism, banditry and all other sort of crimes carried out mainly under the influence of drugs.\n\n\u201cI think it is something you as an agency needs to look at and see how you can make provisions either within the law establishing the NDLEA or maybe if it is during the amendments of the constitution to make provisions for state courts because these offences are many and if you say only federal high court will prosecute it drags the cases and I think it makes justice.very slow to the extent that people are getting tired.\u201d\n\nGovernor Masari recalled how a notorious drug dealer in the state has been escaping justice for a long time now. He said the man identified as the leading drug peddler in Daura axis of the state, has become a sort of \u201cRobin hood\u201d as he spends money frivolously within the community for marriages, naming ceremonies and every other thing even while he is killing their people and children.",

          "text": "ActionAid Nigeria has raised an alarm that women with disability in the country are faced with double jeopardy.\n\nIn a message on the International Day of Persons with Disability, the Country Director of ActionAid Nigeria, Ene Obi, who decried that people with disability have had to face discrimination, said the case of women with disability is made worse.\u201d\n\nThe ActionAid Nigeria and partners joined the world to commemorate this year\u2019s International Day of Persons with Disability with the theme \u201cLeadership and Participation of persons with disabilities towards an inclusive, accessible and sustainable post-COVID-19 world,\u201d which aimed to promote the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities in all spheres of society and development, and to increase awareness of the situation of persons with disabilities in every aspect of political, social, economic, and cultural life.\n\nObi, while stating that: \u201cActionAid has been working on disability issues prior to 2015 when world leaders committed to achieving SDG4 to deliver equitable, inclusive, and quality education for all by 2030. ActionAid Nigeria\u2019s evidence-based approach to work over the years showcases challenges faced by Persons with Disability, one of which is the disability and gender gaps impacting on their participation in all spheres of life. The research revealed a broader exclusion for women who are subjected to harmful stereotypes.\n\n\u201cThis means that whatever the challenge faced by Persons with Disability, women with disability suffer more and are subjected to double discrimination. Poverty and other challenges of exclusion undermine their dignity and places barriers of exclusion in the society\u201d.\n\nShe added that this is the same for children with disability in Nigeria, noting that ActionAid\u2019s research on Inclusive education shows that 95.5% of children with disability are out of school because of their non-enrollment due to their condition.\n\nShe lamented that those who enroll, are less likely to complete their education compared to their peers; this is associated with over-crowded classrooms, inaccessible learning environment, lack of facilities to support their learning as teachers are unable to give them the required support. These have huge impact on their ability to participate in leadership and overall development of the country.\n\nObi said despite progress made in ratifying the Policy on Inclusive Education in Nigeria, current education resources are insufficient to achieve inclusive education; only two percent of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Universal Basic Education Commission is provided for special needs. Budgets and plans are not sensitive enough to support inclusion which makes financing inclusive education very difficult.\n\nShe added that the research by ActionAid and partners further revealed that Nigeria lacks the teacher workforce required to deliver inclusive education as they have not received sufficient training to practice inclusion in addition to inadequate fund to purchase the necessary technological materials, noting that just 20% of $8.3 billion dollars lost to unnecessary tax incentive in Nigeria could pay for the recruitment and renumeration of estimated deficit of 790,422 primary school teachers required in the country.\n\nShe however said ActionAid Nigeria commends the Federal Government on the establishment of the National Commission for Persons with Disability (NCPWD) and call for more investment in infrastructure and public services that account for the needs of this teeming population, and by extension, everybody\u2019s need, but advised governments to ensure that PWDs participate equally and meaningfully in all processes; designing, legislating and budgeting for city planning and public transport.\n\nObi said: \u201cActionAid Nigeria urges governments to leverage on additional revenue by closing tax loopholes and limiting unnecessary tax incentives to provide disability friendly public services including public transport. We call on state governments to expedite action in domesticating the Disability Commission as further delay will amount to great injustice especially at a time when the world is battling COVID-19, one of the most lethal pandemics in the history of mankind.\n\n\u201cWith less than 10 years for attaining the 2030 SDGs, it is crucial that the Federal Government take concrete actions to honor the UN commitments and mobilize all available resources to deliver on SDG4 thereby ensuring no child is left behind especially at a time when the world is dealing with a pandemic. As the federal and state government work on the 2022 Appropriation Bill, we remind them that there is still an opportunity to ensure that the budget is sensitive to address disability challenges in the country especially for the education sector. ActionAid will continue to work with PWDs to advocate for the rights, push for their inclusion, support the development of policies and budget for inclusive education.\u201d",

          "text": "The World Bank Group has called on the Federal Government to impose special taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and sugar-sweetened beverages to improve primary healthcare, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports.\n\n\u201cIf we want to improve healthcare in Nigeria, we need to tax the things that are killing us.\n\n\u201cThe economic rationale for taxing these products is strong if we want to save lives and make a better and healthier Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 Mr Shubham Chaudhuri, Country Director for Nigeria, World Bank Group, said.\n\nHe made the call on Friday in Abuja at a special National Council on Health meeting organised by the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\nChaudhuri noted that taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages would reduce the health risks associated with their consumption and expand fiscal space for universal health coverage post-COVID 19.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe country director stated that investing in stronger health systems for all would contribute to tackling rising poverty and inequality.\n\nHe added that health tax increases would have the additional advantage of reducing future healthcare costs by curbing the growth of the non- communicable diseases that tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages cause.\n\nIn his goodwill message to the meeting, Dr Walter Mulombo, WHO\u2019s representative in Nigeria, said he could attest to the enormous health needs of Nigerians and efforts made so far in meeting the needs.\n\nHe said his attestation was based on the fact that he had visited half of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states in less than two years in the country.\n\nMulombo noted that while COVID-19 exposed weaknesses in the global economy including health, he considered it a unique opportunity for a thorough evaluation of existing resources and mechanisms to prepare better for a more resilient future.\n\nHe pledged that the WHO would continue to lead technical support for Nigeria in the development and implementation of its home-grown policies and plans.\n\nThis, he explained, would be in the context of the global health agenda as reflected in the country\u2019s Cooperation Strategy.\n\n\u201cThis we have taken into consideration, even as we currently review our operational plan and budget for the next two years,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMulombo said the duty of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through building resilient health systems, was a collective responsibility requiring incremental steps in the right direction and continuous improvement.\n\n\u201cTracking implementation of the resolutions of this Council in line with Nigeria\u2019s and global health agenda will strengthen on-going journey towards promoting health, keeping the world safe, and serving the vulnerable,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his contribution, UNICEF\u2019s Chief of Health, Dr Eduardo Celades, noted that it was optimistic that the meeting would arrive at recommendations to drive tangible, equitable and sustainable results for Nigeria.\n\nThis, he stressed, was particularly for women and children in line with the SDGs vision of \u201cleaving no one behind\u2019\u2019.\n\nCelades said that achieving the desired outcomes would require the match of deliberations with the needed actions.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I urge Council members and delegates to reflect on how best to address the chronic obstacles between Nigeria\u2019s great potential and her aspirations in the health sector.\n\n\u201cNotable among these challenges is a persistent decline in health expenditure as a proportion of GDP from 1.2 per cent in 2004 to only 0.58 per cent in 2018\n\n\u201cInadequate financing of primary healthcare services at service delivery points and the current suboptimal allocation of 1.5 million naira per ward under the Basic Health Care Provision Fund.\n\n\u201cInadequate human resources for health \u2013 there are fewer health workers for Nigeria\u2019s population, skewed distribution towards urban centres, skills gaps, poor motivation, weak regulation and poor visibility.\n\n\u201cSuboptimal primary healthcare infrastructure and equipment, erratic availability of essential commodities and supplies and poor maintenance culture.\n\n\u201cWeak coordination and accountability mechanisms resulting in duplication, inefficiencies and lack of value for money, are the others, \u2018\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cWorking together, we can tackle the problems using tried and true strategies and available best practices,\u2019\u2019 Celades stressed.\n\nHe assured that UNICEF was committed to continued partnership with Nigeria to protect and promote the right of everyone to survive, thrive and transform.\n\nHe added that UNICEF was determined to apply its comparative advantage as an agency to support Nigeria\u2019s development efforts within the health sector and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe are finalising the next Country Programme Document for 2023 to 2027 at the heart of which is an increased emphasis on coordinated, multi-sectoral action.\n\nThe theme of the 2021 National Council on Health meeting is: \u201cThe journey to attaining sustainable development goals: Applying lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic towards building a resilient national health system\u201d.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered substituted service on the Attorney General of the 36 states of the federation in a suit against the 36 states of the federation seeking total financial autonomy for the nation\u2019s judiciary.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIn an originating summons marked FHC/ABJ/CS/502/2021, the plaintiff, Emeka Okoye, sued the 36 states through their Attorney Generals.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the hearing date fixed for December 7, the court has granted leave in favour the plaintiff to serve the 36 state Attorney Generals by substituted means by posting the originating summons and other processes through Courier services to be delivered to their various addresses.\n\nSpecifically, Justice Binta Nyako had after hearing an exparte motion by counsel to the plaintiff, Chief Oba Maduabuchi (SAN), appointed a national courier outfit, Red Star Express, as special bailiff to effect service of the originating summons and other accompanied processes on the defendants as good and proper service.\n\nIn moving the exparte motion, the senior lawyer had submitted that originating summons for service on the defendants outside jurisdiction of court issuing the writ is governed by the provisions of sections 97 and 99 of Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and not the rules of the court issuing the originating summons.\n\nHe further submitted that without the leave of the court sought and obtained, the service of the originating processes on the defendants will be null and void and liable to be set aside upon application by the defendants.\n\nAlso listed as defendants in the originating summons dated June 18, 2021, are the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF).\n\nIn the substantive suit, the plaintiff, is seeking an order of the Federal High Court, \u201cdirecting the Federation Account Allocation Committee (2nd defendant) to henceforth pay directly all monies standing to the credit of the judiciary to the National Judicial Council (NJC).\n\nAmong the questions he formulated for the court to find an answer to in resolving the matter is \u201cWhether by the provisions of sections 121 (1), (2) and (3) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), it is proper for the state Governor to include the budgetary expenditure of the judiciary in the state which is charged upon the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the state in the budgetary estimates the Governor presents to the state House of Assembly?\u201d\n\nHe also asked, \u201cWhether by the provisions of section 121 (3) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria(as amended), it is proper to pay funds standing to the credit of the judiciary in the state to any other person or authority outside the heads of court in the various states as directed by section 121(3) of the 1999 constitution?\n\n\u201cWhether by the community reading of sections 81(3), 121(3) and 162(9) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria(as amended), the Federation Account Allocation Committee is right in paying the fund standing to the credit of the judiciary to various state Governors and not National Judicial Council as directed by the above sections of the constitution?\u201d\n\nHe sought an order of the court \u201cdirecting the Federation Account Allocation Committee (2nd defendant) to henceforth pay directly all monies standing to the credit of the judiciary to the National Judicial Council (NJC).\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff prayed for \u201can order directing the Accountant General of each state of the federation to pay directly to each head of court in the state, all such funds standing to the credit of the judiciary in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his 19-paragraph affidavit filed in support of his suit, the plaintiff said the 1999 constitution is the grund norm upon which all laws and actions of governments and agencies derive their powers and authority.\n\nHe said Nigeria, upon independence, adopted a federal system with three tiers of federal, state and local governments with three arms \u2013 the executive, legislature and judiciary.\n\nMr Okoye said the Nigerian constitution created 10 courts for the federation and the 36 states.\n\nHe said the same constitution made various provisions for the disbursements of funds due to the judiciary from the federation account to be paid directly to the National Judicial Council and not any other person or authority.\n\nThe lawyer added that the constitution equally makes provisions for how funds standing to the credit of the judiciary from the consolidated funds in the states are to be disbursed a and paid directly to the various heads of courts of the various states.\n\nHe however noted that under the system being adopted in violation of the constitution, funds meant for the judiciary are being to the governors of the 36 states, instead of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and heads of court in the states.\n\nHe said the direct payment of the fund due to the judiciary to the governors of the 36 states \u201cis against the spirit and letters of the 1999 constitution.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the NJC \u201cis the only body authorised by the constitution to receive and distribute funds due to the judiciary either in states or the federal courts for their capital and recurrent expenditures.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

The new cases reported Wednesday represent a 16.5% positivity rate of cases tested, up from a 1% rate early in November.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s previous surge, driven by the delta variant in June and July, saw daily new cases reach a peak of more than 20,000. With a population of 60 million people, South Africa has recorded more than 2.9 million COVID-19 cases, including nearly 90,000 deaths.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to be certain that the omicron variant is responsible for the rise in cases, but it is very possible, say experts. Standard PCR tests can suggest that a positive case is caused by omicron, but only a full genetic sequencing can confirm it.\n\nLabs in South Africa and Botswana are urgently doing genomic sequencing to study omicron cases in order to see if it is significantly more transmissible, causes more serious cases of COVID-19 or if it evades protection from vaccinations, said Gumede-Moeletsi.\n\n\u201cThe current data that we\u2019re having is still very limited. So there are so many additional characteristics of this virus that the researchers are busy studying, of which transmissibility is one of them. Severity is also another,\u201d she said, adding that researchers also need to find out if current vaccines will still be effective against it.\n\nHospitalizations for COVID-19 are rising in South Africa, but not at the dramatic rate of the new cases.\n\nThe omicron variant has been detected in five of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces and accounted for 74% of the virus genomes sequenced in November, the country\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases announced Wednesday.\n\nThe earliest detection of the variant in South Africa may have been on Nov. 8 in Gauteng province, according to data released by the institute. It said until the end of October, the delta variant accounted for most genomes sequenced in the country, but in November the omicron variant overtook it.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

A city described as the Jewel of the Middle East where the best of Nigeria\u2019s fashion and entertainment have come out in full force to celebrate our great country on this day that marks Nigeria\u2019s Day at the Dubai Expo 2020\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to support this initiative and celebrate all our young people around Nigeria and the world. We are here to celebrate the birth of Nigerian culture as we unleash the power of youth for a new positive image for Nigeria. That\u2019s why we call on all young people to be law-abiding in whatever country they find themselves, to seek the power of their creativity and hard work to make the world a better place. They must eschew violence, drugs, cultism, fraud and other criminality and use their God-given talent to build a new world order. At the same time, as a listening government, we will do all we can to ensure equity and justice for all Nigerians against all forms of brutality.\u201d\n\nHe added that his administration will continue to support youths through education, sports and sciences \u201cas we create the enabling environment for tech-driven investment led telecommunications enabled creative economy and prepare our nation for the emerging new world.\n\nThe President also underscored the potentials of the creative sector to unlock Nigeria\u2019s economy and increase employment opportunities for young people.\n\n\u201cThe projections are promising as the sector is expected to be worth over USD10 billion by the end of 2021, making a significant contribution to the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nThis is further underlined by a recent report on Nigeria\u2019s creative industry which showed that the industry is positioned as the second largest employer and has the potential to produce 2.7 million new jobs by 2025.\u201d\n\nHe added that the achievement of the sector is one that fills him with pride as it demonstrates the grit determination and natural talent that exists in the Nigerian polity and has the potential to become the hub for exporting Nigeria\u2019s culture.\n\nBuhari also praised afro-fusion artistes\n\nBurna Boy and Wizkid who won Grammy awards last year. He recognised that the entertainment industry is a major factor for the country to be recognised globally.\n\n\u201cWe salute all award winning musicians bringing glory to Nigeria at the Grammys and other global events and urge them to continue to thrive\u2026We are at the cusp of a revolution in entertainment production, creative talent and services. And my desire is to build a brighter future for coming generations.\n\n\u201cThe ARISE Fashion Week is a great testament showing the world how we as Nigerians are working hard and constantly innovating to improve the lives of our youth and our people, while opening up our economy and encouraging foreign investment to ensure economic growth and progress for all citizens.\u201d\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s progress in the telecommunications industry, the President announced that the journey to 5G had begun and Nigeria will soon be transformed.\n\nAlso gracing the glamorous event that was held at Armani Hotel, Burj Khalifa, Dubai was the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele who also reiterated the Banker\u2019s Committee commitment to renovate the National Theatre.\n\n\u201cThe project is costing the Banker\u2019s Committee almost USD100 million to resuscitate and refund the National Theatre.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed that so far, about USD5 billion has been disbursed to support the creative industry initiatives in fashion, film, music and television.\n\nThe occasion saw the launch of ARISEPlay, the streaming platform from the THISDAY/ARISE Media Group dedicated to showing the best of African entertainment to the world.

We are determined to tell the world that the time of Nigeria is here.\u201d\n\nAFW drew well-heeled personalities from Nigeria and UAE like Mr. Segun Ogunsanya, former beauty queen and lawyer Helen Prest-Ajayi as well as long-term partner of the show, supermodel Naomi Campbell who opened the show with a two-piece attire for the designer Hudayya.

          "text": "*Nigeria gets 1.683m bpd January quota\n\n*Receives Dec. 17 deadline to submit compliance plan\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite concerns over the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, and recent emergency oil reserves releases by a United States-led coalition, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ yesterday resolved to stick with its current production policy of 400,000 bpd monthly increases in January.\n\nThe decision came as a surprise to market watchers who were expecting the producers\u2019 group to temporarily halt the July 2021 agreement to tame the expected oversupply from the first quarter of 2022, owing to the added threat of renewed lockdown by some nations.\n\nA number of analysts had expected the group to pause its monthly increase next month in light of the upcoming strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) release by key crude buyers and the recent emergence of Omicron, a potentially more transmissible Covid-19 strain.\n\nIn July, OPEC+ had agreed on a roadmap to restore all of the production it removed from the market in May last year in response to the Covid-19-induced collapse in oil demand.\n\nThe roadmap entailed a 400,000bpd increase in the group\u2019s collective quota every month through to April next year, followed by a rise of 432,000 bpd each month until all of the original cut is unwound.\n\nThe increases must be rubber-stamped at monthly ministerial meetings and can be paused for up to three months if market conditions warrant it.\n\nThe group also agreed to a six-month extension to the deadline for its compensation scheme which imposes additional cuts for countries that produce above target to the end of June 2022.\n\nIn reaction, oil prices were largely bearish for the rest of the day. Specifically, Brent crude, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, was $1.21, or 1.7 per cent lower at $67.66 a barrel as of yesterday afternoon, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.24, or 1.8 per cent, to $64.33.\n\nGlobal oil prices have lost more than $10 a barrel since last Thursday, when news of Omicron first shook investors, but OPEC and its allies insisted on releasing more oil into the market next month in line with previous months.\n\nAlso weighing on the market was weekly US inventory data showing that US crude stocks fell less than expected last week, while petrol and distillate inventories rose much more than expected while demand weakened.\n\nA statement released after meeting stated: \u201cThe 23rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), was held via videoconference, on Thursday December 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe meeting reaffirmed the continued commitment of the participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to ensure a stable and balanced oil market.\n\n\u201cIn view of current oil market fundamentals, the meeting resolved to reaffirm the decision of the 10th ONOMM on April 12, 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings including the 19th ONOMM on July 18, 2021.\n\n\u201cIt reconfirmed the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th ONOMM and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of January 2022.\n\n\u201cIt agreed that the meeting shall remain in session pending further developments of the pandemic and continue to monitor the market closely and make immediate adjustments if required.\u201d\n\nOPEC noted that it was extending the compensation period until the end of June 2022 as requested by some underperforming countries and requested that they submit their plans by December 17, 2021.\n\n\u201cCompensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th ONOMM,\u201d it added.\n\nWhile reiterating the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism, the organisation resolved to hold the 24th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting on January 4, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria has received a production output allocation of 1.683 million bpd for January, in spite of its inability to meet previous quotas.\n\nThe country has been lagging in its capacity to produce enough as a result of ageing upstream infrastructure, sabotage and oil theft as well as difficulty in restarting the oil wells that were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently assured that by the end of the year, Nigeria would be able to ramp up its production to at least 1.7 million bpd.\n\nDespite the over 1.6 million bpd allocated to Nigeria in September and October, the country was only to supply 1.399 million bpd and 1.354 million barrels in the two separate months.\n\nKyari argued that although Nigeria has faltered in meeting its OPEC allocation, by the end of the year, the country may be able to hit 1.8 million bpd, excluding condensates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that by the close of the year, we will get back to the 1.7 barrels to 1.8 barrels per day of crude oil. When I mention this figure, I am only talking about crude oil because we also produce condensates and when you combine, we can easily hit 2.0 million barrels by the end of the year,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe GMD reiterated that Nigeria was hugely impacted by its inability to restart the oil facilities after the Covid-19-induced shutdowns, emphasising that with the fresh clarity around the fiscal environment with the introduction of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), more investments were being expected in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear, during the covid-19 pandemic, we shut down some of these wells and they usually don\u2019t come back as early as we want them. Right now, we do have some challenges around the facilities and these are being taken care of. There\u2019s enormous work going on that will get us back before the end of the year,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Sanwo-Olu's \"White Paper\", Walk For Peace Or Trampling On Truth, By Bolaji O. Akinyemi",
          "text": "The Apostolic Round Table (ART) having read through the White Paper released by the Lagos State Government on the report submitted by the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution of SARS-Related Abuses and Other Related Matters into the massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th of October, 2020 viewed the White paper a grand betrayal of trust of relatives of the dead, the injured, Lawyers, the Justice and everyone that participated in the over one year exercise. The White Paper also made it abundantly clear that the State government is under some \"unknown\" pressure that made it lost the will and independence to accept untainted truth.\n\nThe Author, Dr Bolaji O. Akinyemi\n\nNigerians are not new to government at different levels setting up Panel of Inquiry to buy time after heinous human right crime has been committed against the people or when their common wealth were looted by the agent(s) or appointee(s) of the government that set up the Panel. Peradventure the panel's report succeed in generating a White Paper, one can bet a hand that the recommendations will not be implemented. Governments knows that a breaking news of criminal events in another State, Ministry, Agency or Department will distract Nigerians attention.\n\nThe idea of picking and choosing the Panel's recommendations to suit the State government appallingly shows disregard and disrespect for men and women of the bench and others that painstakingly listened to victims and witnesses during the sessions. Where is the notion that 'you cannot be a judge in a case where you are a party'.\n\nAll the senseless conspiracy theories and fallacies from government legal team, officials and Abuja liars will suffer the same fate as lies concocted in the past. Initially, the soldiers were not invited but later the truth came up (that it was the governor that invited the murdering soldiers). Before, no live amunitions were used, now it was both live and rubber bullets. Before, It was a demon from hell that love darkness that switched off the lights, now it was the Toll Gate management staff carrying out instructions from an \"unknown Director\". The C in C and his camp even tagged the protest \"a coup decisively dealt with\" (imagine a president's thought!) We now know that the soldiers were actually briefed and came to deal with the \"coup plotters\" and restore the C-in-C to power. A minister even came uninvited, did a shameful \"Inspector Parrot\" tele-detective investigation and discovered an exhibit that he publicly declared he had handed over to the State government. Today, nothing was heard from the SAN turned Detective. Methink that what government had suffered from all these lies and manipulations will help it to change its approach and tactics and embrace genuine reconciliation and healing.\n\nOnly God knows who bewitched the State government to come out disputing the number of deaths as stated in the Panel's report. What does this government stand to gain from reducing nine deaths to one, if not to irritate and enstrange itself from the people . When you invited and unleashed briefed soldiers, not with whips, batons or tear gas but with live amunitions on armless youths, what did you expect?. Need any one tell our governor that soldiers are only trained to \"kill and destroy\" more so that their C-in-C has declared the targets as \"coup plotters\". It is not rocket science to know that \"unknown soldier\" are trained to ensure their victims (coup plotters) end in \"unknown graves\". Please, ask the Orkars if Gideon Orkar's s body was released to them for burial. Bodies of coup plotters, (I suppose) are properties of the Government. The debate about the number of dead bodies seen on the spot, in the mortuary or attended to by a Professor is irrelevant. The soldiers will let you see what they want you to see.\n\nThere are families out there who lost their loved ones to the senseless attack who were forced to accept their fate and declined appearing before the Panel for fear of being persecuted in future. They are vindicated today as people who showed courage to appear before the Panel are now being attacked by government sponsored lackeys.\n\nAny efforts to twist and turn the Panel's report will only worsen the battered image of this government on this incident. For example using Professor Obafunwa's testimony as to the dead bodies examined by him, under cross-examination by the Lead Counsel to the victims of the Lekki Massacre, Mr. Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika SAN, the Professor claimed that he attended to ninety nine dead bodies between 20th and 24th of October, 2020. He further testified that three out of the ninety-nine dead bodies were from the Lekki Toll Gate and one out of the three had a projectile that penetrated his heart, leading to the loss of his life.\n\nThe questions then are:\n\n1. Why did the White Paper shun and disregard the testimonies of the three leading #EndSARS protesters/eyewitnesses, to wit: (1) Serah Ibrahim (who led the contingent of Victims of Lekki Massacre and represented by Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika SAN), (2)Dabira Ayuku (who led the contingent of #EndSARS Protesters as represented by Adesina Ogunlana and (3) Ayo ADEMILUYI with Kamsy Ibeh (who was attacked by assailants a week ago). The witnesses testified under oath to the fact that they saw several dead bodies after the shooting by soldiers of the Nigerian Army at the Lekki Toll Gate on that fateful day of 20th of October, 2020? Ignoring their testimonies and asking them to come and walk with you is insulting sir.\n\n2. Assuming without conceding that only one soul died at the Lekki Toll Gate on the 20th day of October, 2020, does it not behove the Lagos State Government to take responsibility after accepting all the recommendations of the Panel that confirmed same and tender unreserved apology to both wounded victims and families of those who died in the massacre?\n\n3. How many number of people would have died at Lekki to extract compassion and apology from this government?\n\nOnly one man, George Perry Floyd Jr. died in the hands of Minneapolis, Minnesota police officers that generated global outrage (just like Lekki Toll Gate massacre). The officers were arraigned, tried and convicted. The Minneapolis Police Department and the Minnesota State Governor apologized and paid compensation to the family and the black community, the then Democratic Party Presidential candidate, Joe Bidden Jr. paid condolence visits. Where is wickedness and arrogance taking us to in this country?\n\nMr Governor, do you in all honesty believe that your proposed walk will be truly seen by men of good conscience as WALKING for peace and not as TRAMPLING on the grave of the dead, blood of the injured and the truth revealed in the Panel's report. But again, Mr. Governor, why now? Moreso when nothing has been done yet to compensate victims and their family or punished anyone indicted in the Panel's report before a walk of the type proposed can be embarked upon. You must have heard that most concerned and aggrieved have declined taking part in this TRAMPLING called WALKING.\n\nYour Excellency, we just hope you will not descend so low to deceive yourself and yours (but the world will not be fooled) by mobilizing your party men, garage lackeys and street urchins who are at your beck and call and can be induced with SWAGA packs, to embark on the proposed TRAMPLING.\n\nSome of the names mentioned in the State Governor's press briefing have spoken. In their opposition to the planned walk, Mr. Adedayo (Mr.Macaroni) said \"no one is warring with the government, what people want is justice\". Seun Kuti also in similar vein said: \"it is justice that can bring peace\"\n\nMr. Famoroti complained that \"the people he would like to walk with are locked up in various cells and prisons\"\n\nTo all the churches in Lagos State, the time is ripe to proof that there is still a healing balm in Gilead. We call on all our fathers in Lord: Pastor E.A Adeboye, Pastor W.F Kumuyi, Bishop David Oyedepo, Bishop Olumakaye, and other Generals in Christ, to please lead our Governor and State to the fountain of truth that makes for the healing of Lagos where the blood of innocent cries.\n\nIf the Governor really wants to walk his talk, he should personally invite aggrieved stakeholders (no security agencies for now please) to hear how the bereaved, hurt and injured can be assuaged. Money alone cannot heal the wounds occasioned by the incident.\n\nThe Panel has done it's work, it is now in your court to show HUMILITY and LEADERSHIP. It will start from tendering GENUINE UNRESERVED APOLOGY to ALL on behalf of yourself, your government and all Agencies that were directly or remotely mentioned in the incident. This will set the tone for healing. You will be surprised at how victims will open up even more than they did during the Panel sessions.\n\nHowever, instead of WALK FOR PEACE we will suggest a WALK FOR HEALING or WALK FOR JUSTICE.\n\nMr. Governor, you want PEACE, the people (the hurt and the bruised) want JUSTICE. Peace is a product of Justice. If it's about putting the Lekki Toll Gate pain behind us, listen to the people first.\n\n\"Can Two Walk together except they be agreed?\"\n\nDr. Bolaji Akinyemi",

          "text": "In May 2019, MTN Nigeria (MTNN) was listed on the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE), immediately adding over N1.8 trillion to the market cap of the exchange. This marked one of the biggest leaps forward for the stock market in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year on, Bloomberg named Nigeria the best performing stock exchange in the world, posting a 50 percent gain at the end of 2020. The Lagos bourse closed with the highest points since December 2007, beating 92 other stock exchanges around the world.\n\nAt the time MTN Nigeria was listed, many Nigerians sought to invest in the telecommunications giant, but were limited by how tightly held the shares were, and the rigorous process involved in getting a hold of valuable stock on the NSE.\n\nThat story is changing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being the second most valuable company in Nigeria, only behind Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria is offering 14 percent of its tightly-held shares to the Nigerian public.\n\nOf the entire MTN Nigeria share, approximately 79 percent is held by MTN Group. However, the group is currently letting go of 14 percent of its holding to as many Nigerians who are interested \u2014 making it the biggest member of the bourse to make such an offer.\n\nThe best part of the deal is that any Nigerian with a bank verification number (BVN) can buy MTN shares, and for as low as N3,380 on a mobile phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHOW TO BUY MTN SHARES FOR AS LOW AS N3,380\n\nMany Nigerians are interested in buying a piece of MTN, but are not interested in the rigour and the hurdles of natively buying the shares of a company listed on the Nigerian exchange.\n\nAfter analysing the process firsthand, TheCable can report that the steps are a lot easier and a lot cheaper to go through as against the traditional ways of buying shares in Nigeria. We have since broken it down into 10 easy steps as seen in the infographic above and explained below.\n\nStart with an app: For this process, you would need a smartphone. Go to your phone\u2019s app store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDownload App: Download the Primary Offer app from the Google Play store or the Apple iOS store to your mobile device. The app is made by Chapel Hill Denham, watch out for that. With a good mobile network, the download and installation should take less than three minutes.\n\nSet up an account: Create an account using your bank verification number and date of birth. Here, you\u2019d also need to set up your password, which should be kept as privately as possible. Once this is done, the app, would already have some of your details, showing that it is somewhat connected to the banking system.\n\nValidate your account: After setting up your account, you will be asked to enter your security code. That code is in an email you already received. It is a one-time password (OTP), which you will type into the app to validate your account.\n\nLogin and begin: Once your account is all set up, you\u2019d get a congratulatory message on your screen. The message would also have a blue button, asking you to login to the app. Enter your email and recently created password to get into the dashboard. Once you\u2019re in, click on MTN Nigeria offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerms and Purchase: Once you click on MTN Nigeria offer, you\u2019d see the terms and condition page, read and accept by ticking the unchecked column near the purchase button. Once you do that, click on purchase.\n\nChoose a number of shares: Your latest screen should now be showing \u201cEnter your transaction details\u201d. In the column for specified units, enter the number of units you want to buy. The minimum number of shares you can buy is 20.\n\nAccording to MTN, \u201cthe minimum application is 20 shares and multiples of 20 shares thereafter, so 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120\u2026etc. There is no maximum, however, the amount of shares allotted will be within the offer size of up to 575,000,000 ordinary shares.\u201d\n\nOne share cost N169. So for the minimum number of shares, you would need N3,380.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPay now: After choosing the number of shares, and checking the terms and condition box, you click on \u201cpay now\u201d. The app asks if you have a CSCS account. A Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS) account is a financial infrastructure for clearing, storing, and settlement of securities transactions. It is where all your shares are domiciled.\n\nIf you have a CSCS account, click on yes, if not, click on no. The option you choose will determine the next line of action. For both answers, the process is simple. The app helps set up your CSCS account and allows you to process payment for the shares.\n\nIf you already have a CSCS account, enter the account number and your clearinghouse number (CHN). After this, you update your bank details, where your dividends will likely be paid then you click on \u201cpay now\u201d.\n\nPay with card or USSD or transfer: When you get to this page, you have many payment options, choose which one works for you \u2014 bank transfer or card payment or just USSD \u2014 and pay for the shares. Please note that bank charges will be added, bringing your N3,380 to N3,418.\n\nShare allotment: Once payment is made, you would get a mail, stating the details of your payment and confirming receipt of the payments. Following approval by SEC, your shares would be allotted in less than 15 days. Going with these steps, you easily become an MTN shareholder.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving with disabilities means several things to different people. Faustina Urassa, Programme Officer at the Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal Cord Injury (KASI), Tanzania, sees it as an opportunity to help others who have lost their ability to walk.\n\nUrassa trains people who have suffered from spinal cord injury how to use wheelchairs. Using a wheelchair herself, she says, \u201cif you have the appropriate wheelchair that meets your needs and suits you, you\u2019ll forget about your disability.\u201d\n\nFor young South African, Gift Moloke, living with disabilities means a difficult schooling process. Moloke, who has down syndrome, was rejected by several schools his mother applied to.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), 80 million people live with disabilities in Africa. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) puts the number of people living with disabilities at 300 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the numbers might be inaccurate, the story of Urassa and young Moloke are not the only ones on the continent. While it is already difficult to live with these disabilities, society makes it even more difficult.\n\nThe UN also affirms that most Africans living with disabilities are excluded from school and work opportunities.\n\nIn 1992, the UN proclaimed December 3 as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to \u201cpromote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nFrom people living with learning disabilities to stuttering and being deaf, we have explored what living is like for people with disabilities and the role of technology in making life easier.\n\nNotably, Techpoint Africa has, at different times, covered tech tools that can ease life and work for people living with specific forms of disabilities like stuttering, deafness, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia, among other learning disabilities.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of the Disabled, we are looking at four tech innovations that could help people living with disabilities globally.\n\nTactile watches for the visually impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEone Switch with additional rings Source: Oracle Time\n\nHyungsoo Kim, CEO, Eone timepieces, created the Eone when he realised that all watches and clocks rely heavily on vision.\n\n\u201cCould there be a way to cater for the blind?\u201d he thought to himself. Kim and his team went to work and came up with the Eone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eone allows users to check the time simply by touching and looking at it. Think of it as a regular watch, but it has balls instead of an hour and minute hand. One on the surface indicates the minute, and another on the side that shows the hour.\n\nEone stands for Everyone. Kim believes that products and services should be inclusive, and while his invention works well for the blind, people with vision can use it.\n\nRecalling when a group of visually impaired persons was testing the Eone, Kim was asked if the watch was made specifically for the blind.\n\n\u201cI said yes and expected a positive response, but they said, \u2018that\u2019s not what we want; what we want is what everyone else also likes.\u2019\u201d\n\nReturning the sense of touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsthetic arm\n\nWhile prosthetic limbs are nothing like the natural, they can give amputees something close.\n\nDr Luke Osborne, a researcher at John Hopkins University, Baltimore, US, wants to get prosthetic limbs even close to being natural with his invention, E-dermis.\n\nThe invention could return the sense of touch to prosthetic users. The tech works with a phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome.\n\nAccording to Osborne, it is a \u201csensation where you\u2019ve lost a limb or part of a limb, but you can still feel it. The region of the brain that represents the limb is still there and still working to some extent.\u201d\n\nOsborne wants to tap into this sensation and help people who have lost a limb feel things they\u2019ve not been able to for a while.\n\nEliminating stigma with fashionable prosthetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBionic arm Source: CNET\n\nWhile Osborne is looking to return the sense of touch to prosthetic limbs, a group of video game enthusiasts is working on making it life-like.\n\nA video game company and a company that develops bionic arms \u2014 DEUS Ex Universe and Open Bionics \u2014 came together to create prosthetics that are more than just medical devices.\n\nOpen Bionics Co-founder, Joel Gibbard says, \u201cwhat we are trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable, functional, and beautiful prosthetic devices to amputees.\u201d\n\nLooking like something out of a video game, Andre Vu, Executive Brand Director of DEUS Ex Universe, says they wanted the device to be something people wore fashionably.\n\nOpen Bionics has made a semi-functional prototype of these fashionable bionic arms and hopes to perfect the useability.\n\nTranslating sign language into speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUni demo. Source: the Daily Mail\n\nUni, a device created by MotionSavvy, converts sign language into text or speech, making it possible for deaf people to communicate effectively.\n\nIn a demo by Alexandr Opalka, MotionSavvy CTO, the device read his hand and converted it into speech.\n\nUsing sensors with dual cameras, it detects the movement of joints in the hands and fingers and interprets them into speech.\n\nWhile assistive technology is great, most of them are pretty expensive and inaccessible to many people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to the UN, 200 million people globally need assistive tech for low vision and over 400 million require products that assist hearing.\n\nWhile the high price tag of these devices contributes to their inaccessibility, they are often not included in welfare schemes, making them even more expensive in high-income countries.\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to assistive tech but, more importantly, persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology?

A feat that was achieved thanks to the Herconomy community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how? It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities.

Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance? According to Dara, \u201cinsurance is one sector that has the power to elevate the economy, but only about 5 out of 100 Africans have any form of insurance protection.\u201d\n\nData by Statista corroborates this statement, revealing that Africa accounts for less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nOfferZen\u2019s $5.1m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfferZone team.

          "title": "Why Nigeria will struggle to meet OPEC\u2019s production quota",
          "text": "Some oil majors are excluding Nigeria from their capital expenditure budgets for 2022, others are divesting out of onshore assets and local producers struggling to restart fields shut in last year during lockdowns, lack capacity to ramp up production, developments that question the country\u2019s ability to meet its production targets next year.\n\nOil cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and its allies led by Russia agreed on Thursday to stick with its current plan to adjust crude output by an additional 400,000 barrels a day in January and raised Nigeria\u2019s output from about 1.5 million barrels per day to 1.683mbpd beginning from January 2022.\n\nNormally, rising oil prices and higher volumes should boost the economy and strengthen the local currency but Nigeria\u2019s reality is nuanced. Production has fallen by over 700,000 bpd this year, as IOCs prioritize investments in other climes.\n\nFor instance, five Western majors such as British Petroleum, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and Total Energies are set to raise their capital spending by at least $12 billion next year, as higher oil and natural gas prices allow investment to return to more sustainable levels.\n\nThese companies are comfortably ignoring Nigeria and moving forward with higher spending in upstream oil and gas in Libya\u2019s Mabruk field, Payara and Yellowtail developments offshore Guyana, the recently sanctioned Equinor-operated Bacalhau scheme offshore Brazil, the US Permian Basin and multiple refining and chemical expansions in the US, UK and Singapore.\n\nRead Also: Oil firms ignore Nigeria, pump fresh dollars into Libya\n\nData gleaned from Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest report showed over the last decade the IOCs\u2019 average capital expenditure per barrel of oil equivalent has fallen seven times more in Nigeria compared to that of the rest of their portfolio.\n\nWood Mackenzie\u2019s data also showed in 2020 the average CAPEX per barrel of oil equivalent across the global portfolios was 51 percent of 2010 levels, whereas the equivalent metric for the Nigeria assets was 7.4percent.\n\n\u201cThe significant drop in investment by these IOCs in Nigeria goes beyond capital discipline alone,\u201d Simon Anderson, director performance improvement sub- Saharan Africa at Wood Mackenzie said in a note. \u201cSome Nigeria assets may be under-invested, resulting in potential upside opportunities\u201d.\n\nDivestments by oil majors amid limited local capacity present another challenge.\n\n\u201cDespite the profitability of their Nigeria assets, the IOCs are under increased pressure to accelerate their energy transition and divest non-core assets,\u201d Wood & Mackenzie said.\n\nSome analysts say the recent quest by oil majors may have exposed the financial and technical capabilities of Nigeria\u2019s domestic operators, who pump between 1,000 and 100,000 barrels each day.\n\n\u201cMany indigenous operators are sitting on significant resources, with opportunities to grow production with access to capital investment,\u201d Wood & Mackenzie added.\n\nFor Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s minister of State for Petroleum Resources, the country\u2019s oil production struggles can only be attributed to technical problems from re-tapping reservoirs that had been shuttered to comply with the stringent OPEC+ cuts of the past 17 months.\n\nKey Nigerian grade Forcados had been disrupted for almost a month until Shell lifted force majeure on loadings on September 10. Industry sources said the suspension of exports was due to an oil spill near the Forcados terminal.\n\nOther Nigerian crudes such as Bonny Light, Escravos, and Qua Iboe have also faced production issues in recent months due to operational and technical reasons.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil production is currently struggling at levels never seen before, but the regulators are ignoring the problem and disguising under OPEC\u2019s quota,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, says.\n\nAlso, a new wave of security threats in Nigeria has emerged that could further dent Nigeria\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cLately there have been groups in communities in the Niger Delta, who while seeking for cash and attention, have been vandalizing oil pipelines,\u201d a Nigeria-based official at a Western oil company said. \u201cDisruption to operations of oil companies in the Niger Delta is rising by the day due to the activities of these vandals.\u201d\n\nA week ago, a militant group in the Niger Delta region code-named Bayan-Men blew up an oil facility producing around 5,000 bpd of condensates operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company, (NAOC) in Ogba-Egbema-Andoni local government area, Rivers State.\n\nThe angry militants, who destroyed oil well, OB5, (Obiavu-5) in the area, accused the oil firm of failing to deal directly with the host communities insisting that they were fighting for justice for their people.",

          "text": "BUA Group, Nigeria\u2019s leading foods, infrastructure, mining and manufacturing conglomerate is at the verge of completing the processes to list the shares of its Food businesses \u2013Flour & Pasta, Sugar, Edible Oils, and Rice \u2013on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX).\n\nThe planned listing of BUA Food businesses awaiting regulatory approvals will further provide for a more robust capital market as the company joins FMCG sector of the NGX.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the year, just as I promised the management of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) when we were seeking to list a few of our businesses, we have commenced the process of bringing our Food businesses to the stock exchange.\n\n\u201cI can confidently announce that this process if almost completed and will provide for a more robust capital market upon listing,\u201d Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA Group said recently at NGX Capital Markets Conference.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is a school of thought that argues rightly or wrongly that the Nigeria capital market system is not deep enough both in terms of the value and breathe of it offerings. Whatever the case may be, we must acknowledge the current efforts of the NGX to deepen the system and keeping market participants abreast of new offerings, but they need to do more,\u201d Rabiu further said.\n\n\u201cAs a private sector operator, BUA Group has been actively involved in the capital market in one form or the other over the past three years with some of the largest successful Mergers & Acquisition (M&A), debt and equity transactions in Nigeria even during the pandemic. We believed in the capacity of the Nigerian capital market to handle those transactions regardless of the economic headwinds. For us at BUA, we have seen increased value \u2013intrinsic and otherwise to our businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Accessibility to food is human right\n\nRabiu noted that when BUA Group listed its Cement business (BUA Cement), they were looking at getting a valuation of about N1trillion to N1.2trillion, but they ended up getting a valuation of over that. Currently, BUA Cement is the fourth largest capitalized company on the NGX with total market capitalization of about N2.5trillion.\n\n\u201cBUA\u2019s expression of interest to list its food business on the NGX is impressive, as it shows the strong philosophy of Abdulsamad Rabiu in institutionalizing the family empire and more importantly democratizing the investment opportunity offered by the family\u2019s portfolio companies,\u201d said Lizzie Kings-Wali, Chief Executive Officer of Blackstone Capital Limited.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe reverse merge of BUA Cement and Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) has proven to be positive for both the core shareholders and minorities and I believe listing of food business should also help to consolidate BUA Group\u2019s strategic objectives of incubating companies and grooming them into large cap entities offering investment opportunities for both local and foreign investors. Interestingly, listing on the NGX also helps to enhance governance. It increase access to capital, and of course lowers the cost of capital to the entity\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith BUA Foods expected to join the FMCG sector of the NGX, it creates new opportunities for investors with appetite for investing in non-financials. Likewise, Ethical and Sharia-complaint investors would be excited at seeing another large-cap Food-based company being listed on the NGX, as it broadens the Basket if investable assets for these class of investors,\u201d Kings-Wali further noted.\n\nShe noted that while the consumer goods sector index has not performed so well this year, losing some 5percent year-to-date (YtD), \u201cthe listing of new large-caps creates new opportunity for the sector. Interestingly, the actualisation of this expression of interest by BUA may also spur interest of other FMCG companies to join the train and list their shares on the NGX, as investors seek new listings to deepen the Nigeria capital market, especially as this helps to break the ice on the sparse primary market activity in the past 2 years.\u201d\n\nBUA IRS Flour has established a state-of-the-art plant in Port Harcourt, Nigeria to cater for the growing needs of its population. The market is expected to grow annually by 6.7percent (Compound annual growth rate CAGR 2020-2025).\n\nFlour is one of the staple foods contributing to the development of Nigeria. Currently, the shares of wheat flour for bread, semolina, pasta and others, are estimated at 60 percent, 20 percent,10 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. The base raw material for bread flour, confectionery flour and noodle flour, semolina, and pasta production is wheat, and 99 percent of the 5.67 million metric tons is imported.\n\nAll the sugar and allied investments of BUA Group are set up to take advantage of the entire sugar production value chain. These include investments in sugar estates as well as refining capabilities.\n\nThe Group currently has 2 ultra-modern and automated mega sugar refineries (BUA Sugar Refinery, Lagos and Eastern Sugar Refinery, Port Harcourt) that utilize state-of-art equipment to refine high quality products for consumption and industrial uses. The Sugar refineries have a total combined installed refining capacity of 1,500,000 metric tonnes. BUA is the only sugar refiner to have refining capabilities outside Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nBUA Group had in response to Nigeria\u2019s backward integration policy in the Sugar Industry, invested in large scale estates within the country to deepen local sugar production through the acquisition of the Lafiagi Sugar Company Ltd (LASUCO) in Kwara state in 2008 and also the establishment of the Bassa Sugar Company in Kogi State.\n\nBUA Group has also acquired about 70,000ha of land in both locations for the purpose of setting up large-scale sugar plantations. Upon fully coming on stream, these initiatives will add significantly to the development of Nigeria\u2019s local sugar industry. In 2001, BUA Group acquired Nigeria Oil Mills Limited which was established in 1951.\n\nWith two main facilities (Nigeria Oil Mills, Kano & BUA Oil Mills, Lagos), the company produces oil from groundnut and cotton seeds and also produces animal feeds and soap. BUA Oil Mills, established in 2008, produces high quality products including palm olein, stearin, Distilled Fatty Acid (DFA) amongst others.\n\nBUA Group currently operates a mill in Kano as well as a rice plantation in Kano, Nigeria. The Group also operates a robust out-growers Scheme targeting about 100,000 rice farmers in Kano and Jigawa States, Nigeria. Rice is a staple food buoyed by strong domestic demand. The mill is the largest in Nigeria at 200,000 tonnes per annum and is currently being upgraded to 1million metric tonnes per annum. BUA Rice Plantation is estimated to cover a land mass of about 10,000hectares.",

          "text": "From LG\n\nAlthough the smart home revolution is still in its early stages, we have witnessed how the Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected smart devices may improve our lives. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine/deep learning, offering individual consumers unique experiences personalized to their tastes and preferences is now more possible than ever before.\n\nAI is making its way into TVs, Washing Machines, Refrigerators and Audio devices like speakers. A product that stays with you for the majority of the day and learn your behaviour has far more potential than one that is only used infrequently.\n\nLG Electronics has been able to position itself as a pioneer in AI-integrated electronics and continues to produce the best-in-market ThinQ line that exceeds consumer expectations as customers across the world demand more efficient and productive smart technology.\n\nAccording to Mr. Hari Elluru, Head, Corporate Marketing LG Electronics West Africa, LG\u2019s 21st-century products are using AI to directly connect with its consumers and make their lives more convenient.\n\nWhat makes the smart technology less daunting today is because now everyone has a smart phone. And through that smartphone, consumers can control all aspects of their connected devices from the bed, sofa or even while doing other chores. The fact that the LG ThinQ app has been downloaded over a million times is proof that there is an audience that\u2019s hungry for the conveniences offered by smart products. But what conveniences are we talking about here?\n\n\u201cLG\u2019s intuitive webOS smart TV platform provides faster, more convenient access to apps as well as simpler content discovery with finely-tuned personalized recommendations. Think of webOS as your concierge who knows your taste and style and can point you in the right direction when it comes to entertainment. LG Magic Remote not only controls your TV but your other LG-connected devices too, and one can complete their smart adaptive viewing experience with voice-responsive LG smart audio devices like LG Soundbar AI ThinQ which supply immersive sound that changes settings according to content\u201d, he explained.\n\nHe stated that \u201cLG\u2019s energy-efficient air conditioner works with the LG purifier to achieve the perfect indoor temperature and deliver fresh, germ-free air to users. And over in the utility room, the LG washer and dryer combo are hard at work improving their performance and efficiency by identifying the type of fabrics being washed and adjusting their programming to deliver perfectly cleaned and dried clothes for the whole family.\n\nMr. Elluru stated that in the kitchen, LG\u2019s intelligent LG refrigerators such as the iconic InstaView Door-in-Door lets users know when food is running low, sends you expiry alerts for your perishable food items and can even self-diagnose any performance issues so you don\u2019t have to.\n\n\u201cLG\u2019s ThinQ integration lets you activate Express Freeze and monitor temperatures with your smartphone, so there\u2019s no need to repeatedly check on the fridge to see if things are ready. It also enables you to eliminate frequent trips to the grocery store with the largest capacity French Door refrigerator, to stock up and store all your favourite foods,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on other AI-powered products of LG, he continued by saying LG OLED and NanoCell TVs with ThinQ deliver next-level AI and elevated viewing experiences right to the living room.\n\n\u201cYou can create a cinematic experience and enjoy amazing gaming time right in your home with LG AI-enabled TVs. With just a simple voice request, LG AI TVs make suggestions suited to your preference such as movies, programs or music.\n\nSmart home of the future will also take home security to a whole new level. Cameras will be able to distinguish intruders from occupants by studying movements, habits and biometrics, alerting the homeowner and the police of any suspicious activity, an indispensable feature for those who are often on the road for work.\n\nAccording to the LG ThinQ 2021 Smart Home Report, the largest group of smart homeowners say saving energy is the greatest benefit of owning a smart home. Smart devices can be set to run when electricity rates are the cheapest and solar panels can charge home batteries which can power the home once the sun goes down. With a grid-connected solar system, smart homeowners can reduce their electricity bills even more by sending excess power to the grid.\n\nThe advantages of AI technologies like LG ThinQ will undoubtedly enable humans to live better and smarter lives. Humans can only enjoy a more mobile, comfortable, and connected lifestyle as internet access and technology adoption improves.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the implications of the declaration on the war against banditry.\n\nThe order declaring bandits terrorists was sequel to an application filed on behalf of the federal government by the Director of Public Prosecution, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, regarding the activities of Yan Bindiga, Yan Ta\u2019adda and other groups of bandits in the country.\n\nIn the ex parte application, the federal government had prayed the court to outlaw the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other terrorist groups across the country.\n\nThe request, according to the federal government in a supporting affidavit, was to checkmate the activities of the groups, which the government said were responsible for killings, abductions, rapes, kidnappings, and other criminal acts in the North-east, North-central, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe federal government blamed the groups for \u201cbanditry, incessant kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, and other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters, and wanton destruction of lives and proper property.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say that the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, were responsible for the deaths of soldiers, police officers, and other security agents across the country.\n\n\u201cCommercial, educational, and farming activities in the North-west and North-central have been disrupted as a result of the groups\u2019 activities,\u201d the federal government noted.\n\n\u201cThe activities of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, constitute acts of terrorism that can lead to a breakdown of public order and safety, as well as a threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security and corporate existence,\u201d the government in the supporting affidavit.\n\nThe DPP said President Muhammadu Buhari gave the approval for his action, which objective is the proscription of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups and other terrorist groups.\n\nThe verdict\n\nSpecifically, the court declared the activities of the \u201cYan Bindiga Group\u201d and the \u201cYan Ta\u2019adda Group,\u201d as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones, to be \u201cacts of terrorism and illegality.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled that \u201csimilar groups, either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called, in any part of Nigeria, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones\u201d are terrorists and banned.\u201d\n\nJustice Taiwo said in the light of the nefarious activities of bandits and their effects on the people and the nation\u2019s economy, he was convinced that such orders were required.\n\nHe extended the proscription order to all other groups in the country, regardless of their names, whose activities and goals are similar to those of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups.\n\nAccording to the ruling, terror activities \u201cinclude, but not limited to banditry, kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters and wanton destruction of lives and properties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe judge held further that the federal government must publish the prosecution order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nFG\u2019s reaction\n\nSimilarly, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, has said the declaration of bandit groups as terrorist organisations by a Federal High Court shows that the Nigerian government was determined to crush banditry in the country.\n\nReacting to the development through his spokesperson, Umar Gwandu, Malami, he said the court ruling proved that the federal government was taking the necessary steps to end banditry.\n\nThe minister, who said the development followed an application filed by his office, said the declaration of bandit groups as terrorist organisations \u201cshows that the federal government was acting in accordance with the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe development is a pointer to the commitment of the federal government to adhere to the international standards in respecting the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism, separatists\u2019 organisations, insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\n\u201cBy this declaration, the Federal Government of Nigeria has taken bold steps to deal ruthlessly with all terrorist groups and their sponsors in efforts to bring a lasting solution to the myriad of insecurity challenges in the country,\u201d the AGF said.\n\nNorthern youth\u2019s take\n\nAlso, the Northern Youths Council of Nigeria in its reaction to the declaration in a statement jointly signed by its president, Comrade Isah Abubakar, and the director-general, media and publicity, Samuel Kure, noted that though it almost took the federal government \u2018forever\u2019 to act on the calls made by various interest groups in the country, including the Northern Youth Council, to declare bandits as terrorists, it was better late than never.\n\n\u201cWe will welcome full military operation in the North-west and North-central parts of the country as in the North-east against Boko Haram and ISWAP elements which have drastically reduced their activities. The Council hereby urges our Armed Forces and other sister security agencies, to arrest and prosecute anybody seen giving the terrorists moral support be it materially, morally or otherwise no matter how highly or lowly placed. The Northern Youths will stand with you in your quest to stamp out terrorism in the North and Nigeria at large,\u201d the youth said in the statement.\n\nCriticisms\n\nHowever, an Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi, has dismissed the declaration of bandits as terrorists as mere political expediency, saying \u201cit will come to no effect.\u201d\n\nGumi said the declaration will have no effect as a similar pronouncement by the federal government on the South-east secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe Islamic cleric noted that although the declaration of IPOB as a terrorist organisation was also backed by a court order, the international community did not accord it recognition.\n\nGumi in a statement by his media aide, Tukur Mamu, said declaring the herdsmen bandits as terrorists is a decision taken for political expediency.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has succumbed to media blackmail by a section of the country. The decision by the government will not have any practical value because even before the declaration, they are being fought and treated as terrorists. So, it is just a nomenclature which I believe will not change the dynamics on the ground.\n\n\u201cIf you can remember, IPOB was also declared a terrorist organisation. The declaration was even backed by the order of the court. But as you can see even the international community did not recognise FG\u2019s declaration of IPOB.\n\n\u201cSo, it has failed to be effective or to achieve the desired results. They have not been banned from travelling to other countries while their citizenship remains intact, it has not been denounced. So, what type of declaration is that?\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Nigerians will not take the herdsmen as terrorists, but should regard the criminality of the few among them against innocent people as acts of terrorism just as we see IPOB and their attacks on security agencies and other northern citizens as acts of terrorism,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nHe argued that very few herdsmen were bandits.\n\n\u201cI hope this declaration will not give the license to people to be profiling herdsmen in general as terrorists and taking laws into their hands against them. It will cause more mayhem.\n\n\u201cThe declaration will not change anything; it will not change the dynamics. Already the military is engaging them. It didn\u2019t stop them from kidnappings and killings. The declaration will not end their aggression against the society.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani banditry is a socio-economic problem. We have seen it, we interacted widely with them. We told the federal government the way out. It can only be won through engagement, dialogue, and justice.\n\n\u201cThat is why today there is relative peace in the Niger Delta because the government has accepted the painful reality of rehabilitating and empowering them. There has to be equitable distribution of wealth in Nigeria and justice for everyone.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to accept it, before the issue of banditry that now affects all of us; the Fulani have suffered so much. They have lost their legitimate means of livelihood; I mean their cows through cattle rustling and extortion by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat has to be addressed as a means of genuine reconciliation and integration. They should have (a) sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nAlso, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a security analyst, Odafe Christopher, said the declaration could make the bandits declare allegiance to local and international terrorist groups, thereby scaling the nature of their attacks.\n\nHe said, \u201cTerrorist is a generic term for those, who react with high velocity violence during criminal action. The court is in order. They are not agitating for anything, rather than to kill, destroy and rob people. Bandits come in 50\u2019s and their attack is always devastating.\n\n\u201cThey leave traces of blood, tears and sorrow. They kill, rape, maim and can totally exterminate entire community. They are presently contributing to food scarcity, as farmers are taxed before they can either plant or harvest their farm produce. This is causing serious food scarcity.\n\n\u201cThe approach is likely to be the same and format in use with attacks on Boko Haram. My fear is the pronouncements could make them upgrade and declare allegiance with existing Islamic notorious groups like Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP).\u201d\n\nBeyond the declaration\n\nLikewise, speaking with this reporter, a lawyer and lecturer at Baze University Abuja, Mustapha Iliya, said it is unrealistic to expect that banditry will be ended simply because bandits have been re-labelled.\n\nIliya said, \u201cThe public debate about the aptness of re-naming bandits, and calling them terrorists, has ended in favour of those who favoured a re-naming. But the re-classification does not mean that banditry is about to become a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cIt is a new beginning for the old bandits as they struggle to understand their new category. It may well be that re-classifying bandits was based on a misperception. Banditry is not terrorism just because it looks like terrorism.\n\n\u201cUnder pressure from sections of the public, including federal lawmakers, the federal government needed to demonstrate greater seriousness in the fight against banditry. What is the difference between bandits and Boko Haram terrorists, for instance? Bandits are focused on sustenance, but terrorists seek political, religious or ideological results. The two are not the same thing, although they are similar because they terrorise the people.\n\n\u201cWill bandits become terrorists because they have been categorised as terrorists? Will they add political, religious or ideological objectives to their sustenance goals? It is noteworthy that the federal government is still fighting a war against terrorism that has gone on for more than a decade. This looks like the beginning of another war against terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cObviously, the country has not won the anti-terrorism war. The war continues because terrorist groups in the country are still active. Indeed, the insurgency has been compounded by the involvement of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP). The insurgents are no longer only Boko Haram members.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the re-classification is that the war against terrorism will now include bandits. It will amount to the government fighting on two fronts. Fighting terrorists and fighting bandits who have been declared terrorists at the same time will further complicate the war against terrorism.\n\n\u201cRe-naming bandits as terrorists is a political stunt. It is yet another move by the federal government to make the public believe that it is serious about tackling the country\u2019s security crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to change labels, and tag bandits as terrorists. But that does not change banditry, and it does not change terrorism. Perhaps, the government can afford to play word games, which is what this re-classification suggests, but the victims of bandits and terrorists know and feel the hell of insecurity. They need more than word games.\u201d\n\nMilitary action\n\nBlueprint Weekend gathered that following the declaration, the military is set to deploy Super Tucano aircraft and other sophisticated equipment in the North-west and North-central regions of the country against the bandits.\n\nThe military had been reluctant to deploy the aircraft outside the North-east because of the conditions attached to the sale of the aircraft by the United States, which was anchored on human rights.\n\nA source in the military also told a sister newspaper that the coast had become clear to deploy the Super Tucano aircraft against bandits in the North-west and North-central, following the court order declaring them as terrorists.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are waiting for instructions from the government for the next line of action. This was one of the things the Service Chiefs discussed with the President on Thursday morning. So, we await further instructions.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a security expert, Christopher Oji, told this reporter that the court pronouncement will give the military impetus to deploy all their arsenal against the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe pronouncement gives definite combat approvals to security forces and a clear direction for international intelligence and security community in support against them. The pronunciation will make both positive and negative impacts.\n\n\u201cRemember the military had told the National Assembly it could not deploy the newly acquired Super Tucano jets and other military hardware to the North-west against bandits due to the agreement signed with the United States Government regarding human rights.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you the truth. I once asked a top officer in the Armed Forces why they had not deployed the Tucano in the fight against the bandits and he said that their hands are tied due to the human rights regulations regarding the aircraft.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the equipment is meant for the war against terrorists and insurgents and since these are bandits, they cannot be deployed.\n\n\u201cHe actually told me that once the bandits have been designated as terrorists, they would be wiped out. Don\u2019t forget that the bandits today are not different from Boko Haram, looking at their activities and the gravity of attacks by them.\u201d",

The relative said Sylvester was assaulted by some cult groups, who he mentioned their names before his death.\n\nThe relative revealed that the 12-year-old passed away on Tuesday after a series of tests and X-rays indicated that he sustained internal injuries from a severe beating.\n\nHowever, Dowen College in a press release that also went viral on social media expressed surprise at the allegation.\n\nThe school said his injuries were sustained while playing football.\n\n\u201cOn the 21st day of November 2021, one of the Hostel Parents reported to the management that the young boy was injured while playing football. The resident registered nurse immediately administered first aid on him and after he expressed relief, was released to return to his hostel room.\n\n\u201cHe was in class on Monday 22nd day of November 2021, but during school hours one of his friends accompanied him to the Sick Bay where he complained of some pain in his hip. The doctor examined him and prescribed Ibuprofen for the pain, while the nurse massaged his leg, after which he felt a bit better,\u201d the statement signed by the school principal, Adebisi Layiwola read in part.\n\nThe statement claims that in accordance with the school\u2019s policy, \u201cthe resident doctor called the deceased\u2019s mother reporting the incident and requesting that she should come for him so that he could get further medical attention\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe mother, however, said she was not in Lagos while she spoke and prayed with him on the phone and promised to send the guardian to pick him up immediately for further medical attention.\n\n\u201cWhen the guardian failed to show up, the next day on the 23rd of November 2021, the doctor called the mother again and this time, she assured that his guardian would pick him from school.\u201d\n\nAccording to the school, \u201cthe guardian later showed up and took the deceased for X-ray, the result of which it said revealed that no part of the boy\u2019s body was broken or injured\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe resident doctor also called the mother later in the week to check up on his progress but she informed the doctor that he was sleeping at the time. The Principal also spoke with the mother on the phone to enquire about his progress and she reported that he was having a massage and gave the phone to him to speak with the principal,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMrs Layiwola said, \u201cit was therefore with a rude shock that it received the news of the student\u2019s death and the accompanying allegations.\u201d\n\nSylvester\u2019s Father\n\nIn an interview with TheCable, Sylvester\u2019s father explained that his 12-year-old son who was named after him and fondly called Junior, passed away while nursing multiple internal injuries alleged to have been sustained after he was bullied by his fellow students.\n\n\u201cMy son suffered. His birthday is next tomorrow (Dec 4). I\u2019ll celebrate it. I\u2019ll have a cake baked. I\u2019ll cut it on his behalf.

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), on Thursday confirmed that three telecoms operators submitted their Expression of Interest (EoI) to the commission to bid for the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, whose auction date has been fixed for December 13, 2021.\n\nThe NCC in a statement signed by its Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, disclosed that it received their applications to bid for the spectrum.\n\nAdinde also said the three bidders met all criteria, including the payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM), which pegged the initial deposit at 10 per cent of the reserved bid price of $197.4 million (N75 billion).\n\nHe said the NCC had already fixed December 10 for a mandatory mock bidding, ahead of the main bidding process that will hold December 13, 2021.\n\nThe three bidders are MTN Nigeria Plc, Airtel Networks Limited and Mafab Communications Limited. All three bidders paid N7.5 billion each as non-refundable initial deposit, which is 10 per cent of the reserved bid price.\n\nAlthough Mafab Communications is not known in the Nigerian telecoms space, THISDAY gathered that it is a new entrant and a strategic investor with a non-mobile licence that is investing in one of the small telecoms operators in Nigeria.\n\nThe NCC stated: \u201cConsistent with its regulatory principle of open and transparent auction, the NCC has announced that three telecoms companies have qualified as approved bidders of the forthcoming 3.5 gigahertz (Ghz) spectrum auction for the deployment of Fifth generation (5G) networks in the country.\n\n\u201cThe qualified bidders that have met the criteria for participation in the licensing process of 3.5Ghz spectrum, including payment of the stipulated Intention to Bid Deposit (IBD) as outlined in the Information Memorandum (IM), are MTN Nigeria Plc, Mafab Communications Limited and Airtel Networks Limited.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the stage is now set for the three companies to participate in the main auction as well as in the mandatory Mock Auction process, which will come as a precursor to the main auction.\u201d\n\nThe commission has also reaffirmed the dates for the conduct of both the mock auction and the main auction. The mock auction was scheduled to hold on Friday, December 10, 2021 at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, while the main auction will hold on Monday, December 13, 2021 at same venue and same time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management of the Nigerian NCC, Mr. Adeleke Adewolu, has expressed the commission\u2019s readiness to launch the 5G network in 2022.\n\nAdewolu who made this known in his speech yesterday, at the agency stakeholders\u2019 consultative forum held in Port Harcourt, stated that the recent engagement of the stakeholders was, \u201cto formally commence efforts towards the launch of 5G networks,, next year.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cThis would enable Nigerians enjoy cutting-edge technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing; Quantum Computing, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the forum titled, \u201cTalk to the Regulator,\u201d Adewolu said it was held at a crucial point in the evolution of the telecoms sector, not just in Nigeria, but globally.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe NCC is currently leading the industry to facilitate the rollout of broadband infrastructure so that Nigeria can achieve the target of 70 per cent broadband penetration to at least 90 per cent of the population by 2025 as articulated in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP 2020-2025).\u201d\n\nAdewolu added that NCC was assisting to put in place critical supporting infrastructure that would facilitate Nigeria\u2019s emergence as a truly digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to develop a comprehensive national citizens\u2019 identity database on which every other sector of the economy which requires citizen identification can leverage,\u201d Adewolu disclosed.\n\nHowever, in his keynote speech, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, stated that the objective of the programme with the theme: \u201cImproving Stakeholders Satisfaction,\u201d was embedded in the NCC\u2019s Strategic Vision Plan (SVP 2021-2025).\u201d\n\nDanbatta listed the vision as, \u201cOrganisational renewal for operational efficiency and regulatory excellence, facilitate the provision of infrastructure for a digital economy which fosters national development.\u201d\n\nAlso, it \u201cpromotes fair competition, inclusive growth, increased investment and innovative services, and facilitate strategic collaboration and partnership.\u201d\n\nRepresented by Adewolu, the NCC Vice Chairman disclosed that such stakeholders\u2019 gathering was earlier held in Kano for the north and Lagos for the south-west, saying the Port Harcourt session was for the south-south and south-east regions.\n\nHe noted that the successes achieved by the industry were because the commission put stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction at the centre of her activities.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo sustain past achievements and reach new heights, we need all our stakeholders, particularly our licensees, to be fully on board. We need you to key into our programmes and to operate with maximum efficiency.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his remarks, the Director, Licencing and Authorisation Department, NCC, Mr. Mohammed Babajika, stressed that despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its resultant challenges, the Commission is further liberalising the Telecoms industry finalising the framework for Mobile Virtual Network Operator and currently reviewing existing regulations.\n\nSome of the stakeholders that spoke with THISDAY at the forum were Doreen Ekeh, Retail manager for the Port Harcourt branch of Airtel Network and Emmanuel Aneke with Smile Network.

          "text": "Despite concerns over the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, and recent emergency oil reserves releases by a United States-led coalition, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ Thursday resolved to stick with its current production policy of 400,000 bpd monthly increases in January.\n\nThe decision came as a surprise to market watchers who were expecting the producers\u2019 group to temporarily halt the July 2021 agreement to tame the expected oversupply from the first quarter of 2022, owing to the added threat of renewed lockdown by some nations.\n\nA number of analysts had expected the group to pause its monthly increase next month in light of the upcoming strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) release by key crude buyers and the recent emergence of Omicron, a potentially more transmissible Covid-19 strain.\n\nIn July, OPEC+ had agreed on a roadmap to restore all of the production it removed from the market in May last year in response to the Covid-19-induced collapse in oil demand.\n\nThe roadmap entailed a 400,000bpd increase in the group\u2019s collective quota every month through to April next year, followed by a rise of 432,000 bpd each month until all of the original cut is unwound.\n\nThe increases must be rubber-stamped at monthly ministerial meetings and can be paused for up to three months if market conditions warrant it.\n\nThe group also agreed to a six-month extension to the deadline for its compensation scheme which imposes additional cuts for countries that produce above target to the end of June 2022.\n\nIn reaction, oil prices were largely bearish for the rest of the day. Specifically, Brent crude, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, was $1.21, or 1.7 per cent lower at $67.66 a barrel as of Thursday afternoon, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell $1.24, or 1.8 per cent, to $64.33.\n\nGlobal oil prices have lost more than $10 a barrel since last Thursday, when news of Omicron first shook investors, but OPEC and its allies insisted on releasing more oil into the market next month in line with previous months.\n\nAlso weighing on the market was weekly US inventory data showing that US crude stocks fell less than expected last week, while petrol and distillate inventories rose much more than expected while demand weakened.\n\nA statement released after meeting stated: \u201cThe 23rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), was held via videoconference, on Thursday December 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe meeting reaffirmed the continued commitment of the participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to ensure a stable and balanced oil market.\n\n\u201cIn view of current oil market fundamentals, the meeting resolved to reaffirm the decision of the 10th ONOMM on April 12, 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings including the 19th ONOMM on July 18, 2021.\n\n\u201cIt reconfirmed the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th ONOMM and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of January 2022.\n\n\u201cIt agreed that the meeting shall remain in session pending further developments of the pandemic and continue to monitor the market closely and make immediate adjustments if required.\u201d\n\nOPEC noted that it was extending the compensation period until the end of June 2022 as requested by some underperforming countries and requested that they submit their plans by December 17, 2021.\n\n\u201cCompensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th ONOMM,\u201d it added.\n\nWhile reiterating the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism, the organisation resolved to hold the 24th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting on January 4, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria has received a production output allocation of 1.683 million bpd for January, in spite of its inability to meet previous quotas.\n\nThe country has been lagging in its capacity to produce enough as a result of ageing upstream infrastructure, sabotage and oil theft as well as difficulty in restarting the oil wells that were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently assured that by the end of the year, Nigeria would be able to ramp up its production to at least 1.7 million bpd.\n\nDespite the over 1.6 million bpd allocated to Nigeria in September and October, the country was only to supply 1.399 million bpd and 1.354 million barrels in the two separate months.\n\nKyari argued that although Nigeria has faltered in meeting its OPEC allocation, by the end of the year, the country may be able to hit 1.8 million bpd, excluding condensates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious that by the close of the year, we will get back to the 1.7 barrels to 1.8 barrels per day of crude oil. When I mention this figure, I am only talking about crude oil because we also produce condensates and when you combine, we can easily hit 2.0 million barrels by the end of the year,\u201d he stressed.\n\nThe GMD reiterated that Nigeria was hugely impacted by its inability to restart the oil facilities after the Covid-19-induced shutdowns, emphasising that with the fresh clarity around the fiscal environment with the introduction of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), more investments were being expected in the country\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear, during the covid-19 pandemic, we shut down some of these wells and they usually don\u2019t come back as early as we want them. Right now, we do have some challenges around the facilities and these are being taken care of. There\u2019s enormous work going on that will get us back before the end of the year,\u201d he stated.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Students of the Lagos State University (LASU) on Thursday expressed their readiness to participate in the \u2018Lagos Peace Walk,\u2019 proposed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to herald the healing of Lagos in the aftermath of last year\u2019s EndSARS protests in the state.\n\nThis is just as a rights activist and member of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry over alleged police brutality, especially, the October 20, 2020 incident at the Lekki toll plaza, Mr. Segun Awosanya yesterday said he would join Sanwo-Olu in the proposed peace walk.\n\nLASU students who came out in large numbers to welcome the governor said they have all resolved to participate in the \u2018Walk for Peace\u2019 with the governor for peace and prosperity of the state.\n\nThe students made their resolve on the matter known through their Student Union Government (SUG) President, Mr. Oladipupo Uthman Badmus, during the sitting of the Students Representatives Council, the legislative arms of the SUG.\n\nThe sitting was the first council session to be held at the newly built students\u2019 Arcade in the school, which was inaugurated by Sanwo-Olu wednesday.\n\nSpeaking during the sitting, which was witnessed by Sanwo-Olu; the Vice Chancellor of LASU, Prof. Ibiyemi Tunji-Bello; Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, Mr. Tokunbo Wahab, and members of the institution\u2019s Governing Board, among others, Badmus and Speaker of the Students Representatives Council, Mustapha Adejuwon, who led students to welcome Sanwo-Olu, who is the Visitor to the institution, described him as a youth-centric governor.\n\nThey commended the governor\u2019s giant strides in Lagos State, especially in the education sector.\n\n\u201cMr. Governor, sir, it is what you signed up for but we are indebted to you. Be rest assured, whenever you walk, we will walk with you. We will be by your side.
