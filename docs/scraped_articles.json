          "title": "APC appeals to Nigerians to shun sentiments on its choice of Shettima",
          "text": ".\n\nAlhaji Murtala Ajaka, All Progressives Congress (APC) Deputy National Publicity Secretary, has appealed to Nigerians to ignore religious sentiment being raised on the party\u2019s choice of Sen. Kashim Shettima as its 2023 Vice-Presidential candidate.\n\nAjaka made the appeal in a statement on Monday in Abuja while reacting to sentiments being expressed by especially opposition political parties on APC\u2019s choice of Shettima.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sen. Bola Tinubu, APC\u2019s 2023 presidential candidate in Daura, Katsina State, announced Shettima, a Muslim and a former two-term Governor of Borno, as his running mate.\n\nTinubu, also a former two-term Governor of Lagos State and one of the leaders of the APC, had gone to Daura to pay Sallah homage on President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nShettima is currently representing Borno Central in the National Assembly.\n\nAjaka, while commending Tinubu\u2019s choice, said the fears being expressed in some quarters only existed in the imagination of opposition political parties.\n\nThe APC spokesman described Shettima as the best choice for the APC to win the forthcoming 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the opposition parties, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had been thrown off balance since Shettima was announced as APC\u2019s Vice-Presidential candidate, hence the noise and their agony.\n\nAjaka said Shettima was a man of knowledge, accomplishment, courage and integrity, who was not given to bigotry, or having corruption badges with any anti-corruption agencies.\n\nHe added that the sterling qualities of Shettima as APC\u2019s Vice-Presidential candidate, had once again thrown the opposition parties off balance.\n\n\u201cThe PDP and others would have preferred our presidential candidate to settle for the less to make it easy for them to win election.\n\n\u201cBut the choice of the trusted and trust worthy Shettima must have disorganised their evil plans.\n\n\u201cWhile we sympathise with the opposition parties, we appeal to Nigerians, who will eventually be the beneficiaries of good governance under Tinubu-Shettima presidency, to see beyond the sentiments of religion and tribe.\n\n\u201cBoth Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Sen. Kashim Shettima are not religious fundamentalists or ultra Muslims, their records in public offices are testimonies to rely on,\u201d he said.\n\nAjaka recalled that as a two-term former governor of Borno, Shettima enjoyed the support of the Christian community throughout his tenure as testified by the state\u2019s chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN).\n\nHe added that there was no government in the history of Borno that had been fair to the christain community as much as that of Shettima.\n\nHe said Shettima as Governor of Borno, sponsored the highest number of Christian pilgrims yearly from 2011 till he left office.\n\n\u201cThis and many other records of mutual respect for all faiths, are there to verify in Borno,\u201d Ajaka said.\n\nHe, however, added that the APC and its presidential candidate would not be distracted from the goal of winning the 2023 general elections at all levels.\n\n\u201cBorno has the largest votes in the North-East where Kashim Shettima has been governor for eight years and now a Senator and still politically relevant.\n\n\u201cIf APC had enjoyed massive support from this state and the entire North-East and the emergence of Shettima as our Vice-Presidential candidate will deny the candidate of the PDP a smooth ride in the zone.\n\n\u201cI think APC and our presidential candidate are politically correct because our main goal for now is to emerge victorious in the coming elections, not forgetting competence which Shettima represents,\u201d he said",

          "text": "By Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South\n\nASABA- SECRETARY-GENERAL of jaw Youth Council, IYC, Worldwide, Frank Pukon, yesterday, sent a notice to the Presidency that the people of Niger-Delta would ward off purported conspiracy by the Federal Government to take over their land and waters through the controversial National Water Resources Bill 2020 after appropriating their crude and gas resources.\n\nPukon, in a statement, said the Land Use Act conferred the terrain of each state of the Federation on the respective governors and consequently, it was wrong for the Federal Government to intrude upon the Act.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the Land Use Act clearly stipulates that \u2018All land comprised in the territory of each State in the Federation is hereby vested in the Governor of that State, and such land shall be held in trust and administered for the use and common benefit of all Nigerians in accordance with the provisions of this Act\u2019.\n\n\u201cTherefore, all well-meaning Niger Deltans and indeed even those in Buhari presidency that are against the bill, assert that Federal Government would not take our crude oil and gas resources, while also plotting to take over our land and waters. We will resist it.\n\n\u201cAs Ijaw people, we would not be advocating for true federalism or a restructured Nigeria under the pillars of devolution of power that will underscore fairness, justice and equity, yet the President will precipitate setbacks to our agitations through a bill that gives constitutional power to the federal government to have absolute control over the nation\u2019s entire water resources, both over and underground.\n\n\u201cWhat is more, the reintroduction of this obnoxious Water Resources Bill is indeed a confirmation that President Muhammadu Buhari is not committed to national unity and cohesion.\n\n\u201cWhat should have been more important to the government now is to contextualize frameworks on the passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, and the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, 2022. Such landmark legislations that will enhance the oil and gas sector in our country and improve the electoral system of our dear nation, the government is rather doing hide and seek.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to once again urge the implementation Committee to expedite action so that our country will start to reap the benefits of these laws. I have been following recent developments to the controversial National Water Resources Bill, 2020 that has re-emerged on the floor of the House of Representatives. Indeed, as many public commentators posit, the bill is not in the interest of our nation.\n\n\u201cI agree particularly at time our country is besieged with plethora of challenges. And perhaps, it contravenes our (Ijaw people\u2019s) struggle for resource control and revenue derivation.\n\n\u201cFrom Lagos to Maiduguri, Sokoto to Calabar, the story has been the same; Nigerians are living in despair, fear of insecurity and a protracted ailment of disunity. Hence, the government of the day must focus on how hope and confidence can be inspired.\n\n\u201cIt should be a concern Nigerians kids are home due to the negligence of the government to strike a deal with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). \u201cInstead of the government to take proactive measures such as declaring a state of emergency on security in the country due to the worsening security situation in the country, it is even abating the situation that has continued to grow worse. The government is susceptible to the promotion of disunity, separatist agitations,\u201d he said.",

In the market place, do we ask about the religion before buying goods and services,\u201d Ayeni stated.\n\n\u201cThe decision is a right decision which is well calculated to attract more support and votes from the northern parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ayeni,\u201dAPC will get more votes from core North considering the fact that Senator Shettima is from there. Senator Shettima has larger support of the northern which would consolidate on the winning of the party from the zones.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu being a great politican would not choose less than excellent saying it is an excellent joint ticket because Senator Shettima is transparent man who believes in the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu agenda like wise he has performed excellently in Borno State as Governor, his experience would be brought to bear in taking the country to greater heights.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Muslim-Muslim ticket, Ayeni stressed that Tinubu as a philanthropic and a detrabilize man would give every religion, tribe and ethnic group their accorded rights and respect, assuring that Nigerians better days lie ahead as Nigerians marching to next year\u2019s general elections.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure you that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is always giving everyone their respect.\n\n\u201cHe has demostrated this when he was Governor of Lagos State, every religions and tribes in Lagos enjoyed him in terms of religious tolerance.\n\n\u201cHis wife is a Christian from a popular denomination and they have been living peacefully, that single character has demonstrated that Asiwaju Tinubu would be able to manage and govern the country with due respect and recognition to everyone.\u201d\n\nAyeni said, \u201cLet\u2019s mobilize for the party to win next year\u2019s general elections so as to consolidate on the gains of the democracy, from ABATCO, we trust Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in his quest to make things work for citizens.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We have seen different unfounded moonlight tales by either elected or appointed persons about the whereabouts of their credentials and how the court adjudicated those matters.\n\n\u201cAs a leading Anti-Corruption Organization and Non-partisan Human Rights and Development league with the mandate to protect and promote universally recognized human rights, public accountability, transparency and environmental justice in Nigeria and Africa, in accordance with International best standards, we call on INEC to be guided by the provisions of Electoral Act 2022 and its guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe have been keenly following the developments around submission of candidates\u2019 names and credentials list for the 2023 general elections by political parties, and the most recent news of candidates claiming their school certificates are missing. Nigerians cannot be cowed by malicious and mendacious claims emanating from the political class.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the Commission\u2019s guidelines towards preparation for the 2023 general election to political parties and the public are clear enough on presentation of certificates.\n\n\u201cWe kindly refer Section 115(1)(c) of the Electoral Act to the Commission which provide thus:\n\n\u201cA person who \u2013 (c) delivers to an electoral officer any nomination paper or result from knowing it to be forged \u2013 commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a maximum term of imprisonment for two years.\u201d\n\nHowever, he (Suraju) advised INEC boss to reject submission of affidavits in place of certificates by candidates due to the several controversies around swearing to affidavit.\n\nHe noted that an affidavit cannot replace an institution\u2019s certificate, hence; an affidavit only contains facts believed by the deponent to be true which cannot stand in place of primary evidence.\n\nHe stressed that it is general knowledge that anyone who claims to have misplaced his/her certificate could always apply to the awarding institution for the issuance of another copy or Certified True Copy of the certificate or his transcript.\n\nHe added that no candidate is above the laws of the land irrespective of his or her status, and expected to strictly comply with provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cWe demand that your Commission communicate the invalidity of affidavits as submitted by some candidates in the forthcoming elections to all affected candidates and their parties.\n\n\u201cFailure to undertake this statutory responsibility will leave our organisation with no other option than to approach a competent court of jurisdiction for an order restraining your Commission from recognising such candidates\u201d, he demand.\n\nHowever, he commended the Commission for listening to public outcries regarding extension of registration of new voters, which is a demonstration of the Commission\u2019s resolve to a free and fair election wherein the largest number of eligible voters are freely allowed to exercise their franchise.\n\n\u201cWe commend the INEC and re-iterate our commitment to ensuring good governance in Nigeria and assure the Commission of our unflagging support in ensuring a free and fair election in Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Presidential candidate unveils ex-Borno governor after briefing Buhari\n\nInterim running mate Masari pulls out voluntarily\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu yesterday explained why he picked the former governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, as his running mate for next year\u2019s poll.\n\nHe said he was guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness and adherence to excellence.\n\nThe flagbearer said to re-envision and reshape the nation, he must set up the best team that would establish a just, capable and compassionate governance for Nigerians, irrespective of religion, region or ethnic origin.\n\nTinubu also said he chose the former governor, following consultations with party stakeholders and other Nigerians as a democrat.\n\nHe described Shettima as an exceptional and extraordinary person, who shares the principles of open and good governance.\n\nDescribed as a cerebral and loyal party man, Shettima, a former university teacher and banker, had served as Commissioner in Borno State before he was elected governor in 2011. In 2019, he was elected Senator.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cI announce the selection of Senate Kashim Shettima as my partner and running mate in the mission to advance and reclaim the fortunes of this great country and the hopes of its people.\n\n\u201cSenator Kasim Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all-important electoral victory but, also, to step into the shoes of the Vice President.\n\n\u201cAs a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character and patriotism, he has my implicit confidence and faith.\u201d\n\nThe eminent politician unveiled the running mate in Daura, Katsina State, after paying a Sallah visit to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said in a statement that since getting the job done means getting the best and most competent people to do it, \u201cwe must prioritise leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations.\u201d\n\nTinubu said no cardinal decision should be premised on politics, stressing that where politics ends, true leadership must begin.\n\nThe presidential candidate announced Shettima following the voluntary withdrawal of Alhaji Ibrahim Masari, who had notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) about his decision.\n\nReflecting on the debate on religious balance, Tinubu emphasised that \u201cif we truly understand the challenges upon us a nation, then, we must also see the imperative of placing competence in governance above religious sentiment.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, I announce my selection with pride because I have made it not based on religion or to please one community or the other.\n\n\u201cI made this choice because I believe this is the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region.\u201d\n\nApparently seized by nostalgia, the APC candidate recalled how Nigerians in 1993 embraced the late Chief Moshood Abiola and a Muslim running mate, Babagana Kingibe, in one of the fairest elections in the country.\n\nTinubu stressed: \u201cThe spirit of 1993 is upon us again in 2023. As such, the ticket we present today represents a milestone in our political history. It symbolises our party\u2019s determination to be a leading light among political parties in Africa.\u201d\n\nTo the standard-bearer, the democratic process and decorum that characterised the ruling party\u2019s presidential primary and the selection of running mate exemplified why APC is the party of the people and of the future.\n\nHe added: \u201cWith this selection, the All Progressives Congress surely shall continue to be the party that shows the way and carries this nation towards its best future. I implore you all to join me on this journey to a brighter future.\u201d\n\nDescribing the electioneering as a moment of hope, Tinubu said the focus should be on love for the country and the advancement of the ideals of democratic and progressive good governance.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must end poverty and bring greater prosperity and more lasting peace.\n\n\u201cLet us be wise of thought, yet courageous in action, as we embark on a collective enterprise that brings jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to those who need them.\u201d\n\nThanking Nigerians for their support, Tinubu said following his emergence as the candidate, they have demonstrated their faith in his capacity to lead the country.\n\nHe noted that his choice of a running mate had been an open and burning question adding that it gave rise to much speculation and debate.\u201d\n\nTinubu said Masari\u2019s withdrawal has put an end to the speculation.\n\nHe stressed: \u201cI have never been an indecisive man and have no present intention to become one. What I am, however, is a democrat. And a democrat must listen to, and consult with, the people and his advisors so that he may reform and govern wisely and on their behalf. This I have done.\n\n\u201cMy political career was not built on blind indifference to the views of others. I appreciate the perspectives of leading members of the party, political allies and key national figures who see Nigeria\u2019s future as I do.\n\n\u201cThey gave me their views so that I might add their valuable insights to mine to reach the best decision possible.\n\n\u201cHaving now listened to the sage, careful advice of a broad section of the party and of the nation, there are a few points I feel I must make about the exceptional and extraordinary person with whom I will share the APC ticket and the principles of open and good governance that informed this choice.\n\n\u201cA dominant theme of my political history and my personal life is my staunch belief in our diversity. Greatness lies in embracing our diversity and making it work to enhance the dynamism and justice of our political system. My selection of a running mate comports entirely with this longstanding inclination.\u201d\n\nEmphasising the importance of competence, openness, integrity and credibility, Tinubu recalled that as governor of Lagos State, these principles helped him to assemble one of the most capable governing cabinets any state or this nation has ever seen.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI trust enough in these principles to allow them to, once more, guide me to construct another exemplary team that can do Nigeria proud.\u201d",

          "title": "CAN, others kick as Tinubu picks Muslim running mate",
          "text": "From Fred Itua and Juliana Taiwo-balonye, Abuja, Agaju Madugba, Katsina, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure and Steve Agbota\n\nThe presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, yesterday, unveiled Senator Kashim Shettima, Muslim and former governor of Borno State as his running mate, ending weeks of cat and mouse game.\n\nHowever, the decision to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket has elicited wide condemnations from Christians and Northern minorities.\n\nTinubu disclosed his choice to journalists at the Daura residence of President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC flag bearer arrived Daura to pay Sallah homage to President Buhari who arrived his home town on Friday. The former Lagos State governor was in Daura to pay Sallah homage to Buhari as well as intimate him of his decision to pick Shettima as his running mate.\n\nThe former two-term Lagos State governor, who won APC\u2019s presidential ticket at the June 8 special national convention and presidential primary election, had earlier chose Ibrahim Kabiru Masari as place holder for the vice presidential slot.\n\nTinubu was away in France from June 27 on a short vacation during which he held some strategic meetings. He returned to Nigeria on Saturday early enough for Sallah festivities.\n\nThe Sun had last week exclusively reported that Tinubu had settled for North East and that his choice had been narrowed down to two \u2013 Governor Babagana Zulum and Shettima.\n\nTinubu\u2019s announcement came amidst protests from the leadership of various Christian bodies in Nigeria, especially the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and Catholic Bishops. His choice, Daily Sun learnt, does not not enjoy the backing of Northern APC governors especially those from the North West, who had insisted that one of them be picked.\n\nCAN fumes\n\nMixed reaction has trailed the APC\u2019s presidential candidate\u2019s decision to run a same religion card.\n\nCAN\u2019s spokesperson, Adebayo Oladeji, said Nigerians should be ready to face the consequences of their actions if they endorsed and vote for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was what he was going to do and we have warned against it. It is up to Nigerians to decide on what they want.\n\n\u201cYou are all alive when we warned Buhari not to allow Muslims to dominate the security architecture of the country and he did it. I think we can see the way the criminals are operating with impunity.\n\n\u201cSo, if Tinubu says he is opting for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in a polarised country like ours, if Nigerians endorse him and vote for him, whatever happens, Nigerians will face the consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you have a government where a pastor is a vice president and pastors and worshipers are being killed you can imagine what will happen when we have a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIt is left to Nigerians to make their choice, let them vote them in and we will all face the consequences together.\n\n\u201cWe are raising our alarm. It is an irony that Buhari they regarded as an extremist when we raised an alarm to warn him against a Muslim-Muslim ticket, he heeded and opted for a Christian as his vice presidential candidate. \u201d\n\nAPC, Tinubu misfired\n\nPDP chieftain and former presidential aspirant, Alhaji Isa Saulawa, described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as signifying victory for his party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for us because it\u2019s an indication that the PDP will return to power in 2023. There is no doubt that whatsoever that the current regime of President Muhammadu Buhari, right from inception, adopted a policy of deliberate marginalisation of the Christian community in Nigeria despite a Christian vice president. So, you can imagine a scenario where we have a Muslim-Muslim presidency. In fact, we are already celebrating the APC and Tinubu blunder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s best choice -Publisher\n\nRenown newspaper publisher and politics analyst, Malam Mohammed Katsina, described Tinubu\u2019s choice as the best for the APC arguing that Shettima recorded outstanding performance when he was governor of Borno State.\n\n\u201cThis issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket is irrelevant and it\u2019s my view that Nigerians should rise above such pedestrian sentiments and forge ahead for the overall development of the country. There is nothing wrong with Muslim-Muslim ticket or Christian-Christian ticket in a democratic setting.\n\n\u201cIf you take Kaduna State as a case study, you see that the Muslim-Muslim ticket is viable where the governor is Muslim and the deputy is also Muslim.\n\nIt\u2019s not best arrangement -Kwankwanso\n\nThe presidential candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, said Muslim-Muslim ticket agenda is not a good arrangement.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on national television last night, he said so many things have changed in the country since 1993 when MKO Abiola and Babagana Kingibe, both Muslims, ran on the platform of the then Social Democratic Party (SDP) and won.\n\n\u201cIn 1993 in SDP, I was deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, we found ourselves in a similar situation where we had a Muslim-Muslim ticket. That was almost 30 years ago and in 2023, it would be exactly 30 years. And so many things have changed in this country. The possible thing to have changed is the quality of leadership that we have seen over the years, which allowed Nigerians to, unfortunately, take to their cocoons in terms of religion, ethnicity region and so on.\n\n\u201cThat is why NNPP will do whatever it can to bring Nigerians together but for now I believe the persons and people who are talking about Muslim-Muslim tickets will soon know that is not the best arrangement. And it is just a matter of time they will realize the mistake of doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy I settled for Shettima \u2013 Tinubu\n\nRegardless of the criticisms, Tinubu has said the ticket represents a milestone in Nigeria\u2019s political annals, just as it was when Abiola chose Kingibe.The 1993 presidential election which was won by Abiola is adjudged to be the freest and fairest election in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nTinubu\u2019s statement read in part: \u201cAll my life, my decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cWhen I was governor of Lagos State, these principles helped me assemble one of the most capable governing cabinets any state or this nation has ever seen. I trust enough in these principles to allow them to, once more, guide me to construct another exemplary team that can do Nigeria proud.\n\n\u201cSecond, this chapter in our country\u2019s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach, a path already chartered by the progressive ethos of the APC. The foundation for sustainable progress has been laid these past seven years by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The challenges of today are consequential because the lives and livelihoods of millions of Nigerians lie in the balance. Visionary and creative leadership will take us to our goal.\n\n\u201cOur focus, therefore, must be on getting the job done; and that means getting the very best and competent people to do it. In this crucial moment, where so much is at stake, we must prioritize leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations.\n\n\u201c I am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate. Just and noble people have talked to me about this. Some have counselled that I should select a Christian to please the Christian community. Other have said I should pick a Muslim to appeal to the Muslim community. Clearly, I cannot do both.\n\n\u201cBoth sides of the debate have impressive reason and passionate arguments supporting their position. Both arguments are right in their own way. But neither is right in the way that Nigeria needs at the moment. As president, I hope to govern this nation toward uncommon progress. This will require innovation. It will require steps never before taken. It will also require decisions that are politically difficult and rare.\n\n\u201cIf I am to be that type of President, I must begin by being that type of candidate. Let me make the bold and innovative decision not to win political points but to move the nation and our party\u2019s campaign closer to the greatness that we were meant to achieve.\n\n\u201cHere is where politics ends, and true leadership must begin.\u201d\n\nTinubu added: \u201cSenator Kasim Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the vice president. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith.\n\n\u201cI am aware that many will continue focus on a particular detail, the question of his faith.\n\n\u201cHowever, if we truly understand the challenges upon us a nation, then we must also see the imperative of placing competence in governance above religious sentiment.\n\n\u201cIn 1993, Nigerians embrace Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe in one of our fairest elections ever held.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of 1993 is upon us again in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs such, the ticket we present today represents a milestone in our political history. It symbolises our party\u2019s determination to be a leading light among political parties in Africa.\u201d",

          "text": "By Bimbola Oyesola\n\nNigerians may be thrown into blackout and experience disruption in rail service nationwide in the coming days, if the Federal Government remains adamant towards the demands of the striking unions in the educational sector.\n\nIn separate statements, the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) and Nigeria Union of Railway Workers (NUR) stated that they were saddened and apalled by the lingering impasse between the Federal Government of Nigeria and unions in the tertiary education sector (universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and research institutes).\n\nNUEE in its statement signed by the general secretary, Joe Ajaero, threatened to embark on a strike, if the deadlock, which has lasted several months continues.\n\nAccording to the union, the industrial action is undoubtedly exposing the students to all forms of negative vices inimical to nation-building.\n\n\u201cThe National Union of Electricity Employees, therefore, wishes to state that, if after the Nigeria Labour Congress\u2019 nationwide protest, the current impasse between unions in the tertiary institutions and government is not conclusively addressed, we shall be forced to stay at home with our children. A stitch in time saves nine,\u201d the union said.\n\nNUEE charged government to address all issues concerning non-implementation of agreements and other matters affecting Nigeria\u2019s tertiary education institutions.\n\nIt noted that a nation that is committed to human capital development does not toy with the education, training and manpower needs of its youth population.\n\n\u201cThe laissez-faire attitude of the government whether in the states or national towards continued closure of schools is a sorry state in the process of our development towards nationhood.\n\n\u201cIt is through education that this country Nigeria could be pulled out of the current doldrums and be positioned towards socio-economic and technological development of the next millennium,\u201d the union said.\n\nThe Nigeria Union of Railway workers, on its part, said it strongly condemned the vapid and uninspiring attitude of the Federal Government to end the lingering faceoff between it and the unions of universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, and research institutions, especially on the government\u2019s no-work-no-pay policy for the striking workers of universities and other tertiary institutions.\n\nIn a statement signed by NUR president-general, Innocent Luka Ajiji, and the general secretary, Segun Esan, the union appealed to the Federal Government to meet the legitimate charter of demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) with no further delay and save the nation\u2019s education sector from total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should be responsible enough to end the ongoing ASUU strike and rescue millions of Nigerian schooling youths who are majorly the children of the working class and poor masses from ruins and tempestuous engagements. The Federal Government should always remember that an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop,\u201d the union said.\n\nAccording to the union, most importantly, government should adopt the preferred salary payment platform in place of IPPIS as proposed by the striking university lecturers and also do all that is necessary for the infrastructural development of the nation\u2019s ivory towers.\n\nMeanwhile, the railway workers said they may be compelled to embark on a total and indefinite strike any moment from now to challenge the insensitivity of the management and the board of Nigerian Railway Corporation to the welfare and wellbeing of the railway workers.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt is unfortunate and most disheartening that, almost eight months after the Nigerian Railway workers\u2019 three-day nationwide warning strike of November 2021 was suspended and clear agreement reached between the union and the management, with January 2022 deadline for the management to provide answers to the charter of demands of the workers, no significant achievement has been made by the management so far to assuage the aggrieved workers till now.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the standard condition of service, which was reviewed last in 1978 and on which the workers demanded a review for immediate application, has been kept in the cooler, unattended, after a review committee was inaugurated to work on it.\n\n\u201cThe review committee worked inconclusively and, till now, there is no known standard condition of service in the rail transport industry. Similar to this, the approval of 95 per cent for salary enhancement has remained a nominal approval without any hope in sight as to when it will translate to cash for the workers.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of recollection, other workers\u2019 welfare demands that led to the warning strike include non-payment of allowances; slavish use of the workers beyond the prescribed eight hours a day and 40 hours a week (weekends excluded) by the Public Service Rule; non-payment of workers\u2019 salaries by IPPIS till the salaries are lost and unpaid; administrative delay in promotion procedures, which culminate in accumulation of promotion arrears and subsequent loss of same; serial ejection of workers from their staff quarters with unfulfilled promise to replace and allocate quarters to the affected staff accordingly; transferring workers from one location to another without adequate provision for their comfort and convenience; among many others.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has beefed up security within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) following a security alert on fresh terrorists\u2019 attacks by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).\n\nThe NSCDC FCT Command in a letter dated July 8, signed by Peter Maigari and addressed to the Permanent Secretary, FCTA, had alerted of renewed threats of attacks by ISWAP terrorists on targets within the nations capital. The letter which stated that ISWAP had declared war on Christians in Nigeria has gone viral creating fear among FCT residents, especially Christian faithful.\n\nIn the letter, titled \u201cRenewed threat of attack by ISWAP\u201d, NSCDC wrote: \u201cCertified intelligence reveals that members of the decimated terrorist group ISWAP have concluded plans to launch more coordinated and spontaneous attacks on selected targets within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and had declared war against Christians in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIntelligence abounds that ISWAP terrorist group has claimed responsibilities of the Tuesday July 5, 2022 attack on Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre, releasing their adherent members.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing is to enable them hibernate in targeted communities (FCT) and re-strategise for further terrorist activities, especially on soft targets to keep the agenda of the group alive to the public.\u201d\n\nThe report added: \u201cTaking into consideration the recent terrorist attack on Kuje medium security custodial centre good two hours without any security resistance indicated their readiness to carry out more coordinated attacks in selected cities/towns, security formations, schools, and worship centres in FCT, hence the released of their members for more formidable squad to achieved their dastardly act.\u201d\n\nIn its tecommendation, the NSCDC, wrote: \u201cAgainst this backdrop, it is advised that counter measures be emplaced, and there is need to review existing security measures around such targets and other sensitive facilities with security formations, in FCT to frustrate the planned attack. This report is submitted for your information and necessary action.\u201d\n\nReacting to the leakage of the intelligence, Civil Defence spokesperson, Shola Odumosu, expressed disappointment, warning that the person who leaked the letter from the Permanent Secretary\u2019s office should be held responsible for the ripple effect it has generated.\n\n\u201cEvery security agency gives intelligence report to the concerned authority from time to time and this one from the NSCDC is not an exception. The leakage of letter is not good for the battle the government is fighting against the insurgence,\u201d he frowned.\n\nThough police sources told Daily Sun that the NSCDC has been condemned for issuing the statement, which is considered to be out of its purview, Daily Sun observed increased security presence within the FCT with the military, police, DSS and other security agencies embarking on series of patrols to ward off possible attacks. Heavy deployment of police was also sighted at soft targets like churches, mosques, recreational and business centres, yesterday.\n\nA police source said the deployment was to forestall what happened at St. Francis\u2019 Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State.\n\nDaily Sun also learnt that the police working in partnership with the military, DSS, hunters and vigilance groups, have also launched series of raids with the FCT to rit of miscreants and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe police have embarked on constant raid on criminal hotbeds in the Abuja. The raid which is carried out on daily basis is being led by the Commissioner of Police, Babaji Sunday, and is yielding positive results with several suspects arrested so far,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source gave names of some the hotspots to include Zuba, Gwagwalada, Gwagwa, Karmo, Jabi, Bwari, Dutse, Jabi, Lugbe, Nyanya, Kugbo, Mararaba, Mpape, Karshi, Massaka, Abaji, Utako market, Apo, Bwari, among other spots.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies are also on surveillance in villages in the area councils where bandits have continued to carry out attacks on innocent villagers,\u201d he said.\n\nFCT Police Command Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, confirmed the raid saying it was part of measures to checkmate the activities of criminals.\n\n\u201c\u2026We have beefed up security in worship nod recreational centres in and around Abuja\u2026so we are at alert we have beefed up security as expected. Our advice to resident is that they should be alert, they should not be scared seeing the massive deployment. It is just a security measures that we are taking,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, the commander Guards Brigade, Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Usman, called on resident continue to be security conscious and report any suspicious movement to the security agencies.",

I will create 100,000 jobs.\u201d\n\nHe told other contestants to step down for him, saying, \u201cI will collaborate with all security operatives and recruit more Amotekun. I won\u2019t allow the Amotekun to carry arms. All the Kabiesis will have one Amotekun guiding them.\u201d\n\nGovernor Oyetola said he remains the best candidate because of his over 30 years of experience in the private sector and 12 years in the public sector.\n\nOn security, Oyetola said: \u201cWe have the joint task force that takes care of armed robbery, kidnapping and banditry. Our collaboration with Amotekun has been effective.\n\n\u201cThere was a helicopter but it has broken down and the cost of repairing it is huge. It will cost about 300,000 dollars. The address can be given to whoever likes to see it in Port-Harcourt.\n\nAmotekun had been very effective. They collaborate with the hunters to go into the bush and pursue the kidnappers.\u201d\n\nThe former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuf, said he remains the most qualified because he has occupied Ine of the highest positions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI will develop a robust community development association that will work with Amotekun and collate intelligent information.\n\nSenator Adeleke said he would provide equipment and gadget for the police as well as collaborate with the traditional rulers to resuscitate the neighbourhood watch.\n\nAlso, Omigbodun promised to incorporate vigilantes by making laws to make it effective, saying, \u201cwe can use drones for intelligence gathering.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector General of Police(IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, has ordered the deployment of the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), DIG Johnson Babatunde Kokumo to Osun.\n\nDIG Kokumo, supervisory DIG for the South-West Geo-Political Zone, is to be assisted by four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nForce Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, in statement, said the IGP has also ordered deployment of adequate police personnel in the ranks of Chief Superintendents of Police and below to ensure a crisis free election.

          "text": "The Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN) has said it will go on a solidarity strike in support of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), and other unions.\n\nMHWUN National President,\n\nMr Biobelemoye Josiah, issued the threat in a statement he jointly signed with Acting Secretary General of the union, Mr Auwalu Kiyawa, yesterday in Abuja.\n\nThe statement is entitled; \u201cMHWUN stands in solidarity with the university based unions in the ongoing struggle to emancipate and reposition the public tertiary Institutions in Nigeria for progressive development\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reported that ASUU, and other unions in public universities, polytechnics and colleges of education, have been on industrial action for more than six months over alleged failure of the Federal Government to meet their demands.\n\nThe unions are demanding funding of the revitalisation fund, earned allowances, implementation of the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) scheme, as well as promotion arrears.\n\nOther demands are; the renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FG Agreement, and the resolution of inconsistency in the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), among others.\n\nJosiah said the leadership of the union condemned in strong terms the lethargic attitude of government in resolving the issues in contention\n\nHe said: \u201cIn order to protect the future of our youths whose academic life is being disrupted, we call on the government to implement without further delay all the agreements it had entered with the unions.\n\n\u201cWe urge the relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s earlier directive to resolve all outstanding issues with the unions is backed by immediate acceptable action that would end the stalemate.\n\n\u201cMHWUN wishes to use this medium to unequivocally state that we firmly stand behind the university based unions and the clear position of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), leadership in this historic struggle.\n\n\u201cOur state councils have been put on red alert, and we will not hesitate to declare a solidarity strike in support of the unions if government fails to resolve the issues within a reasonable time, \u2019\u2019he said.\n\nAccording to MHWUN, no responsible government will close down its public tertiary institutions over patriotic demands for a better funding of its universities and good welfare for its teaching and non-teaching staff.\n\nHe described it as shameful, saying that the union was particularly irked that the Federal Government and the political actors had abandoned the children of the masses at home to waste away.\n\n\u201cInstead, they are seen dissipating energy and resources that could have been used to resolve the issue to fund political tussles.\n\n\u201cWe are more worried with the development because the academic future of the citizenry is being disrupted.\n\n`Whereas the politicians and top government officials have their children mostly in well funded and equipped overseas schools or in relatively expensive private schools in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cDiscerning minds will agree with us that the negative impact of the strike to the future of our children and Nigeria in general cannot be quantified, \u2019\u2019he said.\n\nJosiah called on people of goodwill to stand up in defence of the right and future of children and Nigeria, by demanding that the government did the right thing to bring the children back to the classroom.\n\nSimilarly, the union also categorically condemned in the strongest terms the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nIt noted that the rising orgies of killing, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and extreme agitation for secession, had assumed a dangerous dimension.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers are no longer safe, both in their homes and at work places, as many have lost their lives to these enemies of state.\n\n\u201cWe therefore, demand for a resolute action from government to end this degrading assault on the sovereignty of our nation,\u2019\u2019 the president said.\n\nAlso speaking on the current economic crisis, Josiah condemned the current scarcity of diesel, cooking gas, petrol and aviation fuel, and the rising prices of goods and services all over the country.\n\nHe said that this pathetic development had further exposed workers, whose salaries and income has already been eroded by inflation, to greater hardships.\n\n\u201cThe situation reinforces the earlier call by the organised labour for a resolute action on domestic refining of petroleum,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMHWUN, however, reiterated the union\u2019s call for its members to ensure they registered and obtained their Permanent Voter\u2019s Card.",

It is up to Nigerians to decide on what they want.\n\n\u201cYou are all alive when we warned Buhari not to allow Muslims to dominate the security architecture of the country and he did it. I think we can see the way the criminals are operating with impunity.\n\n\u201cSo, if Tinubu says he is opting for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in a polarised country like ours, if Nigerians endorse him and vote for him, whatever happens, Nigerians will face the consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you have a government where a pastor is a vice president and pastors and worshippers are being killed, you can imagine what will happen when we have a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIt is left to Nigerians to make their choice, let them vote them in and we will all face the consequences together.\n\n\u201cWe are raising our alarm.

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Freelance digital marketer Baraka Mafole wants Tanzanians to thrive in the digital economy",
          "text": "In 2019, Baraka Mafole, then 19, gained admission into the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology (IT). He was excited about this. But then, things took a wrong turn.\n\nAfter discovering that his fellow students were making money online, Mafole decided to join them; he spent hours learning digital skills. But this distracted him from attending classes. As a result, he failed his first-year university exams and was expelled from the university. He didn\u2019t sulk, though. Instead, he started applying for opportunities at different companies. At first he was rejected by many companies he pitched to because, according to them, he wasn\u2019t skilled enough.\n\nHe pored over online courses on YouTube, Udemy, and other educational technology platforms to learn more about digital marketing and social media management. After upskilling, he resumed his search for jobs. This time around, he was successful; a startup in Dar es Salaam hired him as a social media manager.\n\nBut 4 months into the job, he quit. His confidence in his skills had grown, and he was receiving multiple offers for lucrative digital marketing and design gigs.\n\nIn 2020, he decided to become a full-time freelancer. That same year, he registered on online freelancing platform, Upwork, and since he joined, he has earned at least $4,000 from gigs\u2014over a dozen times more than the country\u2019s upper range TZS 315,000 ($135) for minimum wage. He has been awarded a top-rated badge (for earning more than $1,000 on the platform).\n\nShortly after he began making money on Upwork, he began sharing his freelancing journey online, which helped him build a large online following and get invited to speak at events.\n\nIn the last decade, the Tanzanian digital ecosystem has evolved as more Tanzanian citizens have access to digital services. In 2010, just 18.5% of the country\u2019s population had mobile phones. That number has grown 6-fold to reach 82% or 50 million people in 2021. Similarly, mobile internet penetration has grown 5-fold from 2.9% or 3 million people in 2010 to 25% or 15 million people in 2021\u2014with 12 million new mobile internet subscribers added over the decade. Within this period, the East African country has seen significant economic growth\u2014average annual GDP growth of 7%\u2014which has improved the lives of its citizens. This growth and improvement in quality of living can be traced to the use of digital technologies to improve access to key services such as education, agricultural market information, healthcare, financial services and employment, through digital technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Tanzania has seen heavy investments in fibre infrastructure in recent years to connect more Tanzanians to the internet. Back in 2016, the government updated the Tanzanian National ICT Policy of 2003, in what serves as a recognition of the contribution of the ICT sector to promoting socio-economic development in the country.\n\nDigital technology is poised to help Tanzania in achieving its developmental goals. Already, the mobile industry contributes 5.2% (or $5.2 billion) to Tanzania\u2019s GDP, and employs 2.6 % (or 1.5 million) of its total population.\n\nBut despite having an impressive 2.6% unemployment rate, millions of young Tanzanians remain unemployed, and the skills of those that are currently employed risk becoming obsolete in the coming years if they don\u2019t book their place in the digital economy.\n\nFrom university withdrawal to helping thousands of unemployed\n\nDuring his one year away from school, Mafole discovered that a communication degree could improve his chances of getting higher-paying gigs. So in 2021, he returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to study communication.\n\nOne day in May 2021, another enterprising Tanzanian, Leyla Mohamed reached out to him, out of the blue, and encouraged him to spread his impact further by training young people on digital skills. This led them to co-found an initiative called Tanzania Digital Trailblazers later that month, a series of virtual events to bring awareness of digital skills to young Tanzanians.\n\nAfter 3 months, the co-founders changed the initiative\u2019s name to one in Swahili, Sanuka Kidijitali (roughly meaning, \u201cGet informed fast about the digital world\u201d) to help people easily recall the name better. This time around, they added physical monthly digital skills training events to the mix. This helped Sanuk Kidijitali train over 300 people on digital skills such as writing, digital marketing, and blockchain; guides to get jobs on freelancing on job platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn; using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet to speak with clients, and other digital tools such as Canva and Wix for various digital tasks.\n\nSanuk Kidijitali has a 3,000-strong community of young people in various Telegram groups that it is training and connecting to opportunities. It has also spread its awareness through its newly developed university outreach programme to university students across Tanzania, starting from the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSanuka Kidijitali launched a podcast, The Founders Confessions, where its co-founder Mohamed, speaks with startup founders in Tanzania to start and increase conversation about the digital economy in the country. Mafole is the country director of Social Media Day Tanzania, an event which took place last Saturday, on July 2, at the Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salam. It brought together digital entrepreneurs for networking while offering them upskilling sessions.\n\n\u201cOur plan at Sanuka Kidijitali is to reach as many youths as we can, as we currently reach 5,000 plus, but one day we will hit our target of 100,000 per year,\u201d Mafole, who is also Sanuka Kidijitali\u2019s chief operating officer (CPO), told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe have an employment problem and digital jobs are a solution to this problem, but university students can\u2019t use computers and unemployed graduates do not have digital skills,\u201d he said.\n\nMafole said that dozens of Tanzanian youths have connected with his story and have been inspired to upgrade their lives by learning digital skills. After discovering that only 18 Tanzanian freelancers have earned over $1,000 on Upwork as compared to Kenya\u2019s 300, he realised that his country is playing catch-up. \u201cMy task is to help people who don\u2019t have digital skills build them and also help those that do identify and navigate freelancing platforms to get jobs,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut it is not all rosy, Mafole warned. Tanzanian freelancers still have to deal with inaccessible payment gateways or cut-throat transaction costs, high data pricing, and bad internet connection. And that\u2019s not all. They also have to deal with societal stereotypes. \u201cMany Tanzanians still see freelancing as an extra job and not as a real job. When you tell people you are a freelancer, they make you feel like you are unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How I Work: Henry Oji, Lead Photographer at Big H Studios",
          "text": "From photographing top celebrities to global leaders, Henry Oji\u2019s rich portfolio and years of experience has made him one of Nigeria\u2019s renowned photographers. On this edition of How I Work, talks about his journey into the world of photography as well as the tools and systems he employs to consistently create quality work.\n\nCurrent role: Lead Photographer at Big H Studios and Mentor\n\nLocation: Abuja, Nigeria\n\nCurrent computer: iMac\n\nCurrent mobile device: iPhone X\n\nDescribe how you work in one sentence: Building relationships\n\nTell us briefly how you started out and how you got where you are today\n\nI started photography in 2012. After my wedding, I traveled with my wife for my honeymoon and on our way back, I got my first DSLR camera. I always wanted to be that guy who would attend friends\u2019 weddings with a proper camera; not necessarily professional, but I was never a fan of using iPads and all that stuff. Somehow, I think what was an interest became a strong interest, and then from a strong interest, it became a passion.\n\nThe journey hasn\u2019t particularly been easy, but I like to say that God has been very faithful. In the last 10 years, there have been times when it\u2019s been exciting, hard, and excruciatingly difficult. But in all, it has been a good journey because both the exciting parts and the difficult parts have led to forming the person that I am today. And I wouldn\u2019t wish to have it any better than I\u2019ve had it.\n\nWhat does your work entail? Walk us through a typical workday\n\nI\u2019m the lead photographer at Big H Studios. There are other photographers: associate photographers and intern photographers. My role is to coordinate the work across board and to ensure that we deliver the service that people are paying for. So if someone comes into the studio or has been booked for a photo shoot, we want to ensure that the experience is pleasant from the beginning to the end.\n\nFrom when they either make a call or send an email, there\u2019s somebody who books the clients and then we have consultations to acquaint ourselves with the client and also share creative ideas for the shoot. After that, on the day of the shoot, we have assistants who help with the shoot. Once the shoot is done, we send the images to the editing team, but before that, I would handle what many people call color grade or the color work. And after that is done, I would send the pictures to the editing team to finish the skin work. When that is done, the images are sent back to me for final proofing. So it\u2019s just to ensure quality control and that all the images meet the required standard.\n\nSo a typical day for me at work is really just coordinating and ensuring that everybody who has a unique or specific role is carrying out that role to the best of their ability.\n\nBeyond that, there is also the mentorship aspect. We have an academy called the Follow The Light class and when we have classes, there\u2019s also a change in role where I become not just a convener of the class, but also a facilitator and I teach in this class.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you do without?\n\nI think that as a photographer, you can\u2019t do without your eyes. And by eyes, I\u2019m not necessarily referring to your ability to see with your two eyeballs because I also know that there are a few people who are blind and are also photographers. By eyes, I am referring to your ability to see in your mind. That\u2019s the first thing that we use to be able to conceive these images.\n\nThen we move to the actual tools that I work with, which are my camera, my lights, Capture One, Photoshop, and my iMac. That\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shortcut or hack for getting things done?\n\nI think the only shortcut is to just do the work, to be honest. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve been able to devise a particular hack. If at all there is a shortcut, I would say, do the work and delegate where you can so that you don\u2019t overburden yourself with a lot of work.\n\nWhat task(s) do you dislike but still do?\n\nFrom the process of having to conceive the idea, meet with the client, shoot the client, and edit the pictures, my least favorite task would be selecting images, especially wedding images. For an average wedding, you\u2019re looking at over 2,000 pictures. So you have to profile 2,000 images and in some cases, out of 2,000 images, you\u2019re only going to have to select 200 or 300.\n\nThat process can be tedious because you have to make sure that the ones that you\u2019ve selected are the absolute best.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that I can\u2019t do but it\u2019s just not as exciting as all the other tasks that we do.\n\nHow do you keep track of what you have to do?\n\nI have a team that I work with. We have a studio manager who handles the activities of the studio: payment of bills, purchase of equipment, and all the other stuff. We have an admin that is almost like HR and handles the day to day activities and the people in the studio. And we have a creative director who deals with creative mood boards, planning and execution of shoots, and personnel management.\n\nEverybody has their unique role and I think when everybody is functioning optimally, everything goes smoothly. So I just depend on my team and if my team is working, then everything is working.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI\u2019m still trying to find that, sadly. I\u2019m not the best person at taking a break. But generally speaking, if I want to take a break, I would travel or do something that is not directly related to photography.\n\nIt\u2019s not something that I do all the time. I have traveled before; I had a creative block in 2018 and I traveled to a very far place for a conference and came back very refreshed and ready to go.\n\nIf you are in a system that is causing burn out or contributing to stress levels, then my advice would be to take a few steps away from the system and do things that are not necessarily related to the system.\n\nOf late, we\u2019ve been working from home, so I\u2019ve also started to prioritize rest. Once upon a time, I used to work very late, sometimes into the next day, sometimes I slept in the studio, but I realized that no matter how hard you work, there\u2019s always going to be more work. So you have to be very intentional about creating time for rest.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to, watching or reading?\n\nI\u2019m not big on watching movies or series. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make me more mature than anybody, it\u2019s just that sometimes I look at things from the perspective of time, and for the kind of work that we do, you can\u2019t give two hours to watch a movie if you\u2019re owing clients pictures. You won\u2019t be able to watch it with peace of mind because you\u2019ve not been able to deliver.\n\nBut when I do watch, I like to watch martial arts and comedy movies. I like to watch comedy a lot because laughing is very important in any type of work. So even now, I watch a lot of Instagram skits \u2013 the funny ones. I\u2019m also a fan of Marvel, the Avengers and all that stuff.\n\nFor music, I\u2019m always listening to instrumentals. It helps me to calm down because sometimes, there\u2019s a tendency to want to be on the edge with the work. I used to listen to Maverick city but I haven\u2019t paid attention to any of the new songs. My go-to person right now is some guy on YouTube called DappyTKeys. Other than that, random Christian music and sometimes, maybe when I\u2019m working out and need something upbeat, then I could listen to some Afrobeat Nigerian songs.\n\nAre you reading anything right now or are there things you\u2019d recommend?\n\nI want to read my Bible a lot more. I\u2019ve been slacking on that. I used to read a lot, I have a library but to be very honest in the last four years, I haven\u2019t really gotten back to it. I think I just need to be able to discipline myself to make time and read.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nMy late brother once said to me, \u201cnever share your opinion of other people with other people, because you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d\n\nOne of my favorite pieces of advice from my late father was when it comes to money and friends, he said, \u201cdo not give a friend money that you cannot forgo because at a point you will have to choose between the money and your friend.\u201d\n\nFor any photographer or creative listening, my advice would be to just keep shooting, keep practicing, keep getting better, and that success isn\u2019t a destination but a journey.\n\nThe last advice would be that every blessing that God gives us is people centered. So it is not for you alone to say, \u201coh, I have been blessed, let me enjoy the fruits of my labor.\u201d Every time God deposits something, whether it\u2019s a gift, finances, whatever it is, it is because he wants you to be a channel to bless other people.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem you are still trying to solve?\n\nI\u2019ve always said I want to create a podcast, and I actually gave this year as a target, but I am very far from achieving that. I started this year with a lot of enthusiasm, spoke to somebody about it, got the equipment that I needed, and got the space ready, but we\u2019re already approaching the end of July and nothing reasonable has come out of that.\n\nI really want to have a podcast channel so that I can just share life experiences and also invite people who can also share their own personal experiences.\n\nWho would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nBeyonce, because of her work ethic. I\u2019m not a big fan of her music per se or every other thing that she represents, but there was something that she said once that stuck with me. When she was preparing for a show and wanted something done, the organizers and the people who were helping her with the performance said \u201cBeyonce, this is absolutely impossible, nobody has ever done this before, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d And then she said, that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re going to do it.\n\nThat has really just stuck with me because success isn\u2019t cheap, you have to put in the work and you have to somehow be crazy. I feel like, if she answers these questions, there are a couple of things that she would touch that would inspire so many people, myself included.\n\nAlso, Barack Obama. I just really like him a lot and how he presents himself, how he speaks and some of the things that he does. Though, I\u2019m not a big fan of some other things about him.\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Ibrahim Babangida (IBB) as a leader. I know many people don\u2019t like him but it\u2019ll be interesting to hear his views.\n\nAnd then in the photography world, I would say TY Bello and Kelechi Amadi. It would be good to get to know who they are, what makes them tick, what makes them humble even after they\u2019ve achieved so much.",

          "text": "No complacency as we transform to limited coy \u2014 Kyari\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd.) started the new week with an assurance to its investors and stakeholders that the days of complacency were over.\n\nThe assurance came following the repositioning of the company to focus on profitability and value addition to its shareholders.\n\nThe GMD/CEO of the NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari, gave the assurance at the opening ceremony of the 2022 edition of the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Conference and Exhibition which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nDeclaring the conference open, Kyari who was represented by NNPC Chief Financial Officer, Mr Umar Ajiya, called on operators in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry to focus more on gas development.\n\nKyari said emphasis should be on gas-to-power, gas-to-industry and gas-for-export projects and activities.\n\nHe explained that with the reality of the global energy transition and Nigeria\u2019s commitment to use gas as its transition fuel, value now lies in gas development.\n\nThe NNPC GMD/CEO also said that the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) had also provided ample incentives for investors in the gas sector.\n\nKyari urged delegates and exhibitors to use the opportunity provided by the conference to network and brainstorm on solutions to the challenges brought about by the global energy transition and the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\nHe also urged them to find better ways to maximise the potentials inherent in the nation\u2019s abundant gas resources.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC Ltd. within the week called on its partners and operators in the oil and gas industry to beef up investment in order to close the yawning energy supply gap in the country.\n\nThe GMD/CEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, made the call at the NNPC Spotlight Session of the just concluded 21st Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nSpeaking at the conference with theme, \u201cFunding the Nigerian Energy Mix for Sustainable Economic Growth\u201d, Kyari said there was a huge gap in the Nigerian energy market with 80 per cent of citizens lacking access to clean cooking gas and 48 per cent lacking access to electricity.\n\n\u201cThat gap is huge and we cannot fill it with the scale of investment we are doing in the renewable.\n\n\u201cThis is critical for us and we will continue to emphasise that our key role is to be able to bring gas and make it available to everyone.\n\n\u201cThe fact that energy transition is unfolding to everyone means we must invest in it and we are seeing a great resistance across the globe on funding fossil fuel until the Ukrainian challenge came up.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyari, NNPC is currently engaging with partners and multilateral institutions that are involved in energy transition to find ways of resetting financing strategies in a manner that will enable energy companies and institutions to collaborate for investment in order to eradicate energy poverty.\n\nOn the new role of NNPC as a limited liability company, Kyari said that NNPC had been positioned as the company with the largest capital base in Africa to serve as a reliable partner to all willing investors.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, NNPC Ltd. offers a lineup of investment opportunities that guarantee positive returns across the energy value chain.\n\n\u201cOn July 19, 2022, Mr President will unveil the new NNPC Ltd. to the world. I am inviting you to that epoch-making event in the history of our company,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the conference, Chairman of Board of Directors, NNPC Ltd., Sen. Margery Chuba-Okadigbo said that the mandate of the new NNPC was clearly spelt out in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nAccording to her, the PIA is a testament to the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to put in place the right environment for the advancement and development of oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cNNPC limited is a commercially oriented and profit driven company which creates opportunities for improved indigenous participation.\n\n\u201cThe new entity presents opportunities for enhanced revenue and returns on investment.\u201d\n\nShe stated that the effective implementation of the PIA would stimulate sustainable social impact through the creation of quality jobs for the teeming youth and consequently change the social perception of the industry.\n\nIn the meantime, the Group General Manager of the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), Mr Bala Wunti, disclosed that Nigeria needed about 800 billion dollar-worth of investments to meet the crude oil production target of four million barrels per day.\n\nWunti made the disclosure in Abuja during a panel session at the just concluded 21st Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition with the theme, \u201cFunding the Nigerian Energy Mix for Sustainable Economic Growth\u201d.\n\nHe said the money must be channeled into exploration and production, midstream conversion capability and requisite downstream infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, \u201cEnergy Transition: Making Nigeria the Preferred Africa Energy Investment Hub\u201d, the NAPIMS boss said Nigeria had abundant crude oil and natural gas resources which can only translate to value for the country if properly harnessed and produced for the benefit of the people.\n\nHe said that the time had come for the country to look inwards and develop its huge oil and gas potentials by restructuring the industry to attract the much-needed investments across the oil and gas value chain that would create wealth and prosperity for the people.\n\nHe called for stronger partnership and collaboration among stakeholders in the oil and gas sector, particularly in the area of finance, project execution, and technology development.\n\nGiving a breakdown of the investments required, Wunti said that the country needed about 400 billion dollars in the upstream and midstream segments of the value chain, while another 250 billion dollars investment would be required in the downstream sector across the country in order to ensure energy sufficiency.\n\nInternational oil companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria including Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil in the week under review expressed their frustration over the escalating oil losses in the Niger Delta due to the activities of oil thieves.\n\nSpeaking at the industry leaders\u2019 panel session at the 2022 edition of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition, the CEOs said the unrelenting menace of crude oil theft had led to a decline of the nation\u2019s daily oil production from 1.8million barrels per day in the last three years to just a little over one million barrel per day.\n\nFiring the first salvo on the topic: \u201cThe Future of Nigeria\u2019s Energy Sector in the PIA Era\u201d, the Chairman of Shell Companies in Nigeria and Managing Director of Shell Petroleum Development Company, Mr Osagie Okunbor, warned that the new marginal field licensees that would operate Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 53 and 57 may experience difficulties evacuating their crude oil.\n\nOkunbor said that two of the most important oil pipelines in the country were currently shut down with hundreds of thousands of barrels a day shut-in.\n\n\u201cIn three to five years, we were brought down from 1.8 million barrels. So it is an existential issue for us.\n\n\u201cWe need to address it; if we do not address it, we cannot do all the new oil development issues, and that will continue to occur.\n\n\u201cBut what is really going to move the needle for us in terms of bridging this gap of hundreds of thousands of barrels a day is solving the evacuation problem.\u201d\n\nHe tasked stakeholders and participants at the conference to put heads together to seek ways to deal with the challenge.\n\nManaging Director of Chevron Nigeria Limited and Chairman of the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS), Mr Rick Kennedy, said while the industry stakeholders collaborate to fine-tune the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in a manner that offers encouragement to all players, it was also imperative for the oil theft challenge to be addressed by all parties.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Director at ExxonMobil Nigeria, Mr Oladotun Isiaka, who represented the Managing Director, Mr Richard Laing, also said stakeholders should work together to tackle the oil theft challenge as it was impacting negatively on investments in the upstream sector.\n\nThe Managing Director of TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria Limited, Mr Mike Sangster, called for further dialogue between the industry stakeholders and the authorities on the PIA.\n\nThe TotalEnergies boss called for the constitution of another working group made up of persons from the authorities and the industry in order to find ways to address some of the issues.\n\nStill in the week under review, the federal government made a payment of 100 million dollars as part of Nigeria\u2019s counterpart fund in the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) undertaken by German power firm, Siemens.\n\nThe development was aimed at solving the electricity challenge usually caused by the collapse of grid in the country.\n\nChairman, Senate Committee on Power, Sen. Gabriel Suswan disclosed this at the NOG conference during his presentation on the topic:\u201d Developing the Power Sector Policy for an Emerging Economy\u201d.\n\nHe said the Minister of Power, Mr Abubakar Aliyu, revealed that to the Senate committee during a meeting recently.\n\nSen. Suswan added that with this development, power supply would increase to about 7000 megawatts.\n\n\u201cThe government has paid 100 million dollars for the project so that someone can quickly activate that contract, so that the power deficit which has militated against proper servicing of the industry will come to an end.\u201d\n\nAmidst the current global posture on energy shift to renewables to reduce carbon footprint, the NNPC Ltd. said that there was need for Nigeria to adopt homegrown solutions to the nation\u2019s energy poverty challenge.\n\nThe GMD/CEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, stated this in an address at a plenary session on \u201cOil and Gas Industry in Nigeria and the Quest for Energy Transition\u201d at the 2022 National Energy Summit held in Abuja.\n\nKyari was represented at the event organised by the Energy Commission of Nigeria in collaboration with the International Energy Charter (IEC), Brussels, Belgium and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) by the NNPC Group General Manager, Corporate Planning and Strategy, Mrs Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan.\n\nHe contended that given present realities in the global energy community, it had become imperative for the country to focus more on in-country initiatives to harness its abundant natural resources to bridge existing energy gap.\n\n\u201cNNPC is working on floating various LNG projects that will harness the nation\u2019s natural resources to grow the domestic gas market in line with Federal Government\u2019s aspiration to meet energy needs of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPrior to the technical transition to a limited liability company on July 1, 2022, NNPC has proactively set up a world class Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) Division as part of the efforts to become a global energy company of choice.\n\n\u201cThis is because we recognise that innovation remains a core tool in actualising energy transition aspiration.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the General Manager, Gas and Renewable Energy of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Dr Ola Agbaje, pointed out that virtual gas transportation was gaining traction in Nigeria.\n\nHe described the NNPC\u2019s ongoing 614km Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) gas pipeline as a \u201cTransformational Project\u201d.\n\nEarlier in her presentation on \u201c2020/2021 Energy Investment Risk Assessment Reports\u201d the Official of the International Energy Charter (IEC), Ishita Pant, applauded the numerous gas expansion programmes and reforms in the nation\u2019s oil and gas sector, especially, the PIA.\n\nThe session was moderated by a former Group Executive Director of the NNPC and Partner, Gulf of Guinea Petroleum Consulting, Mr Onochie Anyaoku.\n\nIn another development, an oil and gas sector pressure group, Women in PENGASSAN called for stiffer punishment for domestic and gender-based violence offenders to serve as deterrence.\n\nThe call became important following the increasing wave of domestic and gender-based violence across the country.\n\nThe group made the call at the grand finale of its nationwide advocacy programme tagged: \u201cPENGASSAN Women Say No to Domestic/Gender-Based Violence\u201d which held in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking during an awareness march from the Unity Fountain to the Ministry of Women Affairs in Abuja, the Chairperson of the group, Faith Usoro, said tougher punishment for perpetrators of domestic and gender-based violence was the only way to stem the tide of the crime as desperate situations required desperate remedies.\n\nReceiving the group on behalf of the Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen, the Director, Economic Services, of the Ministry, Mr Idris Mohammed, said the Ministry was working with stakeholders to enact more laws to protect the rights of women.\n\nTallen said that even the Bills that were earlier thrown out by the legislature would be revisited.\n\nThe Minister listed some of the measures put in place by the ministry to curb domestic and gender-based violence to include, \u201cone, launch of sexual offenders\u2019 register aimed at naming and shaming.\n\n\u201cWe have a contact line +234-8031230651 and +234-7053576528 for receiving complains.\u201d\n\nOn a final note, the international oil community lost Mohammad Barkindo, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nBarkindo whose tenure commenced in 2016 and was to end this month, was born on April 20, 1959 in Yola, Adamawa State.\n\nHe held a B.Sc. (Hons) in Political Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State and Post Graduate Diploma in Petroleum Economics, in Oxford, United Kingdom.\n\nHe also held an MBA in Finance and Banking, Washington University, in the United States.\n\nBarkindo who was a Fellow, George Mason University, Fairfax VA, U.S., also held a Doctorate Degree in Science (Honoris Causa) of the Federal University of Technology, Yola.\n\nHe began his working career as a Special Assistant to the Minister of Petroleum Resources and Head, Office of the Chairman of the Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC Board between 1986 and 1989.\n\nHe also served in various capacities in the NNPC Group, spanning some 24 years, namely:\n\nHead, International Investments, Investment Division, NNPC Headquarters (1992)\n\n\u2013 Head, International Trade, NNPC London\n\n\u2013 President, Duke Oil Inc.\n\n\u2013 Chairman NAPOIL (1993\u201394)\n\n\u2013 General Manager, NNPC London Office (1993\u201397)\n\n\u2013 Managing Director/Chief Executive, HYSON/CALSON, an international trading arm of the NNPC (1998\u20132003)\n\n\u2013 Group General Manager Investments, NNPC Headquarters (2003\u201304)\n\n\u2013 Deputy Managing Director/Chief Executive, NLNG (2005).\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, he served as Coordinator, Special Projects, NNPC, with the mandate to oversee all Federal Government projects vested in the NNPC.\n\nBarkindo participated as a member of the Oil and Gas Industry Reform Implementation Committee (OGIC) that produced the original draft of the Petroleum Industrial Bill (2008) and led the Transformation Programme of the NNPC as enshrined in the Oil and Gas Industry Reform Implementation Committee Report (2008).\n\nBetween January 2009 and April 2010, Barkindo served as Group Managing Director of the NNPC.\n\nBefore becoming the Secretary General of OPEC, he served at various capacities in the organisation between 1986 and 2010.\n\nHe was a Nigerian Delegate to OPEC Ministerial Conferences between 1993 and 2008 and served as Nigeria\u2019s National Representative on OPEC\u2019s Economic Commission Board (ECB).\n\nBetween January and December 2006, he served as Acting OPEC Secretary General, before chairing the ECB from 2009 to 2010.\n\nHe became Nigeria\u2019s Governor for OPEC and served as Adhoc OPEC Governor at various times, as well as Chairman OPEC Task Force of the 15th Session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD).\n\nAlso on the international energy scene, he spearheaded the OPEC/European Union dialogue on Energy Markets, Taxation and Environment.\n\nHe was a key player in the first Long Term Strategy (LTS) at OPEC, and a delegate to the African Petroleum Producers Association (APPA) conference in Algiers, Algeria, in 1986.\n\nHe was also a delegate to the African Petroleum Producers Association (APPA) Ministerial Conferences from 1987 to 2010.\n\nThe late Barkindo was a pioneer member of the International Energy Forum (IEF), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe helped to facilitate and consolidate the OPEC/non-OPEC cooperation and dialogue on climate change and led Nigeria\u2019s technical delegations to the climate change negotiations that produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.\n\nIt is worthy to note that he was the only Nigerian Delegate to attend all 15 Conferences of the Parties to the UNFCCC from Conference of the Parties, COP1 in Berlin 1995 to COP15 in Copenhagen 2010.\n\nIn 2002, he served as Coordinator, Group of 77 and China at UNFCCC, and was elected Vice-President of the Conference of Parties at COP13 of the UNFCCC in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2007.\n\nHe was re-elected Vice-President variously at COP14 in Poznan, Poland, in December 2008 and at COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2009.\n\nBarkindo participated at the UNFCCC COP22 (Marrakesh 2016), COP23 (Bonn 2017) and COP24 (Katowice 2018).\n\nHis hobbies included reading, charity work, the environment and soccer.\n\nThe Nigerian oil and gas industry, and indeed the entire global energy community missed his invaluable contributions to the growth of the industry.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nOver the last one month we have series of chaotic events in Nigeria. How do you blame Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior for the terrorists attack in Owo where more than 30 people were killed? How do you blame Aregbesola for the killing of more than 90 people in Zamfara State which has provoked the Governor to tell their people to arm themselves? How do you blame Aregbesola for the killing of more than 30 soldiers in a mining site in Niger State? How do you blame Aregbesola for the attack on President Buhari convoy in Katsina State? Those requesting for Aregbesola to be sacked as minister of interior are not objective because the police and army got a report of the Kuje\u2019s correctional attack.\n\nOF late, there had been series of sponsored attacks on military, police, INEC offices and correctional centres facilities. The gory attacks on police stations and other government institutions are launched to strike fear. There have been more attacks on military and police facilities than correctional centres. The military and police provide security for our correctional centres across Nigeria. Why are some people being mischievous about calling for the sack of Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior? The Federal Government has said the security personnel deployed to man Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje, in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) did their best to repel the terrorists\u2019 attack but were subdued. Terrorists Succeeded Because They Had Superior Firepower. The Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Dingyadi, said this while fielding questions from State House reporters after a briefing on the outcome of the emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) on Thursday demanded the sack of the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, for failing to stop attacks on prisons in the country. The group was reacting to Tuesday night\u2019s attack on the Kuje correctional centre in Abuja by the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP).\n\nHURIWA demands the arrest of the persons who gave the order purportedly for the withdrawal of soldiers before the attack.\u201d \u201cWe demand the sack of the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and his Defence counterpart, Bashir Magashi, for perpetual incompetence. They also call for a broad-based judicial panel of inquiry on prison breaks in Nigeria to be constituted.\u201d I want to educate HURIWA that there was a platoon of the Nigerian Army with sophisticated weapons, elite men of the Nigeria Police Force, officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence, and armed officers of the Nigerian Correctional Service, on ground during the time of the attack.\n\nAfter the Abolongo, Oyo State, attack on a correctional facility, in October last year, it became apparent that a new form of attack for which correctional system was not prepared for had emerged. Correctional system was primed to prevent and foil internal disturbance and riots, not external attacks/invasion, since the facilities were usually built around police and military formations.\n\nAregbesola applied section 1 of the Armed Forces Act Cap A20 2004, which pointed out that the establishment and functions of the Armed Forces, which comprise the Army, Navy and Air Force, include functions as may be assigned to them by the President in consultation with the National Assembly. This was carried out by Aregbesola when armed soldiers, police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers were drafted to correctional facilities nationwide, to secure them against further attacks. Several but unsuccessful attempts were made to attack correctional facilities since then, as the armed guards repelled them on each occasion.\n\nAregbesola has made Nigerian Army to complement the Police in the discharge of its duties when called upon by correctional authorities in restoring law and order in situations as contemplated in section 305 of the Constitution, which is in time of emergency. Some may justify it on the basis of Doctrine of Necessity and in the name of national security.\n\nThe consequence of the present security situation is that soldiers, who are trained statutorily to fight international aggressors, have been deployed to assist the police in performing their duties. The military have the constitutional role of defending the territorial integrity of the country against external aggression, to coordinate the enforcement of immigration law and customs, as well as to protect the country\u2019s borders, among others. On the other hand, the police have the responsibility to protect life and property, detect and investigate crimes, and to maintain law and order. Therefore, the increasing deployment of military forces for internal security operations across the country underscores the profoundly dysfunctional state of Nigeria\u2019s public safety institutions, particularly the ineffectiveness of the police force. By law, the police and the Army have their primary duties and responsibilities, which they are trained to do, spelt out in black and white. Section 214 (1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) establishes the Nigerian Police Force as the only policing authority in Nigeria.\n\nAttacks on police, army and correctional facilities have continued across Nigeria with many officers killed in the past one year. Several police officers have been killed in the past one year in targeted attacks on police officers and correctional facilities. The attacks have occurred mainly across the regions of Nigeria.\n\nThere have been many reports of attack on formations and troops in recent months even though some are not confirmed. IF the presence of military institutions were to guarantee peace, safety and protection, Kaduna State would have emerged as the most peaceful and protected entity in Nigeria. Kaduna is blessed with not only elite military establishments but is also home to the largest number of respectable military institutions, making the state the envy of other parts of Nigeria.\n\nIndeed, it leaves one wondering how one state managed to be so blessed with such a large number of elite military agencies, with both intimidating artillery weapons and infantry personnel with global battlefield medals. Unlike other states of the federation with the presence of one military base, a police command and a few security outfits, Kaduna has no fewer than 13 military establishments spread across the state. These are not mean institutions, and are manned by many top officials\n\nThe state is host to the elite 1st Division of the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Army Depot, Zaria, Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Nigerian Defense Industry, Nigerian Airforce Training School, Nigerian Police College and the Nigerian Navy School of Armament, Kachia. Other military institutions in Kaduna are: The Nigerian Army School of Legal Services, Bassawa Zaria, the Nigerian Defence Academy, the Nigerian Army School of Artillery, Kachia, the Nigerian Army School of Military Police, Army Operation Base, Southern Kaduna and the Nigerian Army School of Infantry.\n\nWith these and other security agencies operating in Kaduna, the state and its environs should have become a veritable military fortress that cannot be easily overrun by bandits or terrorists. But this is not the case. It has paradoxically suffered more attacks by daring bandits and terrorists than many other states in the North or any other part of the country. These audacious attacks have come in torrents and destructive fashion, leading to the killing of thousands of innocent persons, destruction of key national infrastructure and the kidnapping for ransom of very important Nigerians. Members of the armed forces have also fallen victims to the ravenous elements, which apparently are always on the lookout for top officials to maim, kill or kidnap for pecuniary gains.\n\nAs a proof, between 2021 to March 2022, security was breached around Mando, Afaka and the International Airport Kaduna with impunity. First, the criminal elements attacked the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation and abducted over 40 students, which they kept in their custody for months until their financial conditions were met by parents of the victims. Next, the terrorists descended on the premier military university, Nigerian Defence Academy, where an officer was brutally slain and another taken captive and only freed by colleagues after some time in captivity.\n\nDo not blame Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior but the police and judiciary system for the continuous correctional facilities congestion due to slow pace of dispensing justice in Nigeria. The correctional service officials should not be blamed for lapses at the correctional yards because they have alerted the police authority and especially the judiciary on the congestion.\n\nCorrectional Centres officials make monthly updates to the Attorney General both in the states and federation on the challenges and the situation has not been addressed over the years. Every Month, the service write to the Attorney General to update them the development on the number of inmates and congestion situation but it has remained like that.\n\n________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Abuja\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

It is like the collapse of our building edifices. We have 27 security agencies, but we have got into confusion.\n\n\u201cThe problem begins with the failure of the military. But principally, the police are responsible for internal security and the political leadership has the duty of constitutional responsibility.\n\nWe have this problem where the army is the first line of security, such that there is no clear delineation of responsibility. There is no clarity as to functionality of roles now. Our security needs to be overhauled and brought into line with constitutional provisions.\u201d\n\nThe former military officer noted that part of the problem is that political will to tackle the challenges seems to be lacking, while expressing hope that the next administration will do better.\n\n\u201cThere is no political will to discharge security duty, because this government is so dysfunctional to arrange security according to the constitution and in line with competences and contingency for maximum performance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have the army and the navy doing police work.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cThere are moles and I don\u2019t know what is going on. Accountability in defence spending is not peculiar to defense, it has to do with the way we function. What about justice, NNPC, FIRS etc. Things are not being done properly.\n\n\u201cWe should not wait until things break down or it is too late before we act. The challenge is, we not acting on intelligence which are even public until there is fire. It is a never ending debate about Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are a secular nation and politics should be done to ensure peace and stability, but religion can be used for negative purposes and should guard against it. We don\u2019t have an effective government if we are negotiating with criminals and terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt is so unfortunate that we paying so much money to bandits to free hostages.\u201d",

The IOCs had repeatedly complained of their inability to produce more crude oil for export due to the massive theft of the product by criminals.\n\nOn the concerns posed by oil theft, the Managing Director, Seplat Energy Plc, Roger Brown, said there was the need for more synergy between the public and the private sectors to address this issue.\n\nBrown, who spoke at the just concluded 2022 Nigeria Oil and Gas conference in Abuja, explained that Nigeria had abundant resources of crude oil and gas, but stressed that this could only translate to value if properly harnessed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that on the oil side, the theft levels are just unsustainable. We have a crippling economy because of it and that has to be solved,\u201d Brown stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cOn the gas side, it\u2019s about fixing the value chain from gas to electricity, from molecules to electrons across the country and getting it right.\n\nAlso at the just concluded conference, the Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mele Kyari, revealed that the decline in the funding of oil investments had virtually led to a halt in the drilling of crude oil by operators in the sector except for the national oil firm.\n\nSpeaking on the challenges in the industry, the NNPC boss stated that though there were other concerns in the business, the issue with reduced funding had really impacted severely on the sector.\n\nKyari said Nigeria was number one in terms of oil reserves in Africa, adding that \u201cwe should be the number one producer of oil, but today we have our challenges, which my colleagues (earlier speakers) have pointed out.\n\n\u201cYes, there are engagements going on and the support that we are getting from government security agencies and the leadership that the Minister of State is giving us to make sure we address this issue around security.\n\n\u201cBut that is not only the problem we have. We have seen a clear natural decline that is happening in our industry today and this is real. And when such decline comes and you are not able to put money to put it back, no one is drilling today except NNPC by the way, and a few others.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo if you don\u2019t drill and decline continues, then you are not only going to see the effect of theft and other vandal actions that we are seeing today, you are also going to see the collateral effect of lack of investments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC in another development stated that the general public should take note that it was not recruiting.\n\n\u201cWhenever the company intends to recruit, an announcement will be made using our official website, verified Twitter handle, verified Facebook page and other credible media channels,\u201d the oil company said in a statement it issued in Abuja on Sunday.\n\nIt added, \u201cAny information suggesting that NNPC Limited is recruiting is false and should be disregarded.\u201d",

          "text": "It is becoming clearer that the decision of Chief Executive Officer of Tesla, Elon Musk, to pull out of his $44 billion bid to buy microblogging platform, Twitter followed more than reasons earlier cited.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man had tendered an offer to buy 100 per cent of Twitter for $44 billion back in April at $54.20 per share in cash, which, at the time, was a 54 per cent premium on the price the day he began investing in Twitter.\n\nBut almost three months after, precisely at the weekend, in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Musk said he wanted to terminate the deal because Twitter was in \u201cmaterial breach\u201d of their agreement and had made \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements during negotiations.\n\nThe social media company, meanwhile, has said it plans to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement.\n\nIn May, Twitter informed that it suspended over half a million accounts suspected to be spam every day. In addition to this, it said millions of accounts that are unable to pass human verification are locked each week.\n\nTwitter Chief Executive Officer, Parag Agrawal, had explained the efforts of the company at reducing spam accounts.\n\nHe said the company also faced the challenge of many accounts that look fake because they have no pictures, but are later verified to have real humans behind them.\n\nMusk claimed Twitter did not provide him with necessary information on the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on its platform, a concern he first raised in May. At the time, he had said the deal was \u201ctemporarily on hold\u201d, until he received the data from Twitter, which had asserted that spam and bot accounts make up less than five per cent of its total users.\n\nWhile these are broadly some of the reasons Musk has intimated SEC for terminating the deal, a number of external factors could have also played a role in his decision, according to analysts.\n\nFirstly, tech stocks globally have seen a massive correction since the deal was announced. On Friday, Twitter\u2019s stock on the New York Stock Exchange closed at a value of $36.81, compared to $51.70 on April 25 when the company had accepted Musk\u2019s offer, a decline of nearly 29 per cent. Tesla\u2019s stock price has fallen by more than 24 per cent since the deal was announced.\n\nSecondly, there were also questions about how Musk would finance the $44 billion deal. In May, Musk had told the US SEC that the deal would include $33.5 billion in equity, up from an earlier commitment of $27.25 billion.\n\nHe had also sold Tesla stock worth around $8.5 billion and had lined up about $7 billion from investors including Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. However, he had told SEC that he was continuing to seek additional financing and was in talks with Twitter shareholders, including former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, about potentially retaining their stakes in the company.\n\nGoing forward, analysts noted that Musk and Twitter could be looking at a lengthy legal battle, as the social media platform has made it clear it will pursue action to enforce the terms of the deal.\n\n\u201cThe Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery,\u201d said Twitter\u2019s Chairman, Bret Taylor.\n\nThe original merger agreement also includes a $1 billion breakup fee.\n\nAccording to Reuters, disputed mergers and acquisitions that land in Delaware courts, more often than not, end up with the parties re-negotiating deals or the acquirer paying the target a settlement to walk away, rather than a judge ordering that a transaction be completed.",

This platform I don\u2019t know. I know he is a strategist, Bola Tinubu, he is a good man. I had reasons to sit with him uncountable number of times from 1992 to date,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI wish I will see him to ask him what he will tell Nigerians what he will do differently from what Muhammadu Buhari is doing today.\n\n\u201cThat is my serious concern for him. Ordinarily, if I cannot get it, I can recommend him but it\u2019s going to be like building something on zero.\n\n\u201cWhen I see him, I wish him well or when you see him before me, tell him I wish him well \u2014 but let\u2019s take it easy.\u201d\n\nWatch video below:",

          "title": "E-Learning Is The New Education Model \u2013 Commissioner",
          "text": "Last Thursday, Kaduna State Government launched an e-learning portal which is also known as Nigeria Learning Passport. What is this passport all about and is it a state government or a federal government initiative?\n\nLearning passport is as simple as the name suggests. You know if you want to travel you need a passport. So, the Learning Passport is just like a pathway or gateway for learning. And it\u2019s actually a collaboration with the federal government and UNICEF and of course our state, Kaduna state. Some other states have also benefited from this. Covid-19 has changed the way we were doing things; now we do most things virtually. People work from home, it\u2019s not about where you are but what you do.\n\nSecondly, this will enable school children to learn at their own pace and from the comfort of wherever they are. The Learning Passport will also facilitate the Open School Programme. You know we have an Open School Programme with the federal government too and the Learning Passport is also part of it. The programme is for those that dropped out of school either because of financial or social reasons, so they can still catch up. This way they can access books, they can learn. Learning Passport is not always online learning, it can also be offline too.\n\nSo basically, Nigeria Learning Passport is an online e-learning platform with mobile and offline capability. The passport enables continuous access to quality education in a highly flexible and adaptable manner. It allows states to easily and quickly adopt the platform as their learning management systems or use it to complement existing digital learning efforts.\n\nSpecifically, the platform has been developed with a unique suite of online and offline functions that cater for deployment in places with poor connectivity, especially locations where children find themselves unable to access quality digital education, tools and content. The platform serves national curriculum content as well as global supplementary resources, including Open Educational Resources (OERs), to support learners and improve learning outcomes.\n\nNigeria Learning Passport is also an \u2018education model\u2019 for early childhood education, primary and secondary education, adolescent skills, and technical and vocational education. Every user has a personalized record of their learning history which is unique to them. It is also a model for teachers and parents to receive the tools and empowerment in order to support student learning.\n\nUnder the Nigeria Learning Passport, learners can access self-paced modules for basic and secondary education courses, early literacy and mathematics, social studies, social emotional learning, child development, and social inclusion for early childhood educators.\n\nThe online component of the learning passport will require computers and some kind of hand held devices, has Kaduna state given the pupils and students those tools to ease e-learning?\n\nNo, we have not given to all pupils and students, but we have provided some of these devices in schools. You know we are doing the computerization of our legacy schools. UNICEF also distributed 7,000 tablets; that is a relatively small number, compared to the number of pupils or students that we have but sometimes these things start at a slow pace before they catch up later. We have a versatile Information Communication Technology unit at Government House, which is manned by professionals. We are working towards improving e-learning in our schools. We have also made provision for more devices and we are going to make additional provision in partnership with some Telecom companies like Airtel, MTN and of course, Microsoft.\n\nThere is always the challenge of connectivity and poor service. Will there be any back up for that at least for students and pupils in the rural areas? Will the government provide this service or the Telecom companies?\n\nYes. Our Chief Information Officer is working on them to increase the reach. We appreciate that there are far-to-reach areas, there are problems of connectivity, so that is being worked on and you know we are rolling out 3G or 4G just to make connectivity seamless as they should be. We should be looking at end of the year to make sure that students who don\u2019t have connectivity or have poor connectivity will notice some improvements.\n\nWhat is this Better Education Service Delivery For All (BESDA) programme that Kaduna state government is doing, all about?\n\nBetter Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) is an education programme which some selected states are running in conjunction with Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). Kaduna state happens to be one of them. You know we have changed our schooling format or school programme to first six years of primary school and three years of basic post primary and junior secondary, then three years of senior secondary. BESDA is actually targeted at primary school or basic education. So, the programme is to ensure that there are sufficient instructional materials like books, smart boards up to the level of even writing materials and bags for our pupils. So, once you have a conducive atmosphere for learning and good service delivery, you expect to see better outcomes. So, this is run by UBEC in conjunction with the state government and we actually flagged-off the distribution of materials for this year last week at Unguwar Sarki Primary School.\n\nBESDA was conceived by the federal government in order to return the over 10.3 million out of school children, according to UNICEF statistics, back to school. The government borrowed $611 million from the World Bank and it is giving 17 states as grants and Kaduna state is one of the states. The states were selected based on out of school children data. The programme started in 2019, and it is going to end some time this year in October. Recently, Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board (KADSUBEB) disbursed N183,000 to 2,121 schools, to enable them undertake minor repairs, out of the N400 million that the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) has given the state government.\n\nKaduna state is involved in fencing schools in very vulnerable places, what is the state of the Safe Schools Programme?\n\nWe have given contracts, some contractors are on site, some others have abandoned the project, some have completed the work, some are almost completed. But I must call on communities to let us know what is happening in those localities and the Administrators of those schools too should inform us about the projects. Sometimes, the problem is that there is a lot of delay, so in between when they start the work; there are lots of procedures. Then there might be storm damage, theft, sabotage and so many criminal things. It\u2019s like government is pulling in one direction and the other forces are pulling in the other.\n\nWe appreciate that we have to do more that is why we are working with the World Bank, also the Islamic Development Bank and other partners to try to see what we can do regarding safeguarding those schools. Like you said, there is also the Safe School Initiative which is being run by the federal government, which we are working on. I commend the Parent Teacher Association of some of the schools, which have worked hard to contribute their quota in safeguarding our schools. We thank some of our partners for their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Even our honourable members of the House of Representatives and senators have been helping in improving the standard of education in Kaduna state.\n\nBut I will also call again, government cannot do it alone, it must be a collective responsibility. You know, the community has to be involved and all hands must be on deck; everyone must play his or her part. I remember most of the Grammar Schools in the southern part of the country, it\u2019s communities that built them. They didn\u2019t just fenced them but they actually built the schools and provide the teachers. The south has been doing this for themselves for a very long time now. So, we need to catch up in that respect but I can assure you that government will do all within it\u2019s limited financial capability to address this.\n\nEDUCATION Facts\n\n-Education is still free and compulsory in Kaduna state, from primary to senior secondary school levels;\n\n-Providing free education is in line with the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the National Policy of Education and the Kaduna State Policy on Education;\n\n-The government has strengthened free education by providing free textbooks and uniforms to primary school pupils and secondary school students;\n\n\u2013 Last year, the administration procured textbooks, handbooks and e-books worth over N800 million for basic and post basic education;\n\n\u2013 In 2020, N800 million was spent on uniforms and over N400 million was also spent for sewing of new uniforms last year;\n\n\u2014 In June 2021, Her Excellency, the Deputy Governor of Kaduna state, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, flagged off the distribution of free uniforms to students;\n\n-From 2015 to last year, Kaduna State Government has constructed about 927 new classrooms and it is building new schools around the state;\n\n\u2013 Seven new schools have been built for gifted and talented students in Danbushiya, Pambegua, Hunkuyi, Buruku, Jere, Manchok and Rigachikun towns;\n\n\u2013Kaduna State Government is building the main campus of Kaduna State University (KASU) along Zaria-Kaduna road, behind National Teachers\u2019 Institute (NTI). So far, over N10 billion has been invested in the project;\n\n-Through KADSUBEB, the state is executing Primary Education Development Projects on the Abuja to Kaduna and Kaduna to Kano roads;\n\n\u2013 Last year, it started rehabilitating and fencing them",
          "summary": "Last Thursday, Kaduna State Government launched an e-learning portal which is also known as Nigeria Learning Passport.\nAnd it\u2019s actually a collaboration with the federal government and UNICEF and of course our state, Kaduna state.\nSo basically, Nigeria Learning Passport is an online e-learning platform with mobile and offline capability.\nNigeria Learning Passport is also an \u2018education model\u2019 for early childhood education, primary and secondary education, adolescent skills, and technical and vocational education.\nBetter Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) is an education programme which some selected states are running in conjunction with Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).",

          "text": "NEWS DIRECT has learned that terrorists are requesting a N100m ransom for each of the 43 passengers from the Kaduna train who have been kidnapped and are currently in their custody.\n\nThe request was made known to the hostage-families taker\u2019s last week.\n\nThis is just five days after numerous armed men on Tuesday rescued the suspected abduction planners from the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Center in Abuja.\n\nA 24-hour period after the incident, the Islamic State West Africa Province released a viral video to take responsibility for it.\n\nDuring the attack, the terrorists overpowered the security guards monitoring the facility and released approximately 300 Boko Haram fighters, convicted criminals, and other prisoners.\n\nThe Federal Government on Thursday uploaded to the Interpol database the data of 64 Boko Haram commanders who escaped from custody during the attack.\n\nNEWS DIRECT had reported that the terrorists attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28, killing eight and kidnapping no fewer than 61 passengers.\n\nAs part of their demands, they requested the release of 15 terrorist commanders, their children detained by the military and an undisclosed amount of cash.\n\nOn June 12, the terrorists released 11 hostages after 75 days in captivity, while another seven regained their freedom on Saturday.\n\nThe victims were reportedly released through the assistance of the Publisher of Kaduna-based Desert Herald newspaper, Mallam Tukur Mamu, who has been negotiating with the militants.\n\nGiving an update on the situation on Sunday, a family member of the abducted victims, who didn\u2019t want his name in print, told one of our correspondents that the terrorists were asking each family to cough up N100m ransom for the release of their loved ones.\n\nThe source said the seven victims that were released on Saturday paid an undisclosed amount.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is money that is still delaying the release of the others. The terrorists are demanding ransom now. We heard the last set paid money. They (terrorists) have reached out to us as regards the payment of ransom.\n\n\u201cThe situation now is that if you have your money, your loved ones would be freed. They have pegged the ransom at N100m. It is just unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAnother family member said they were told that the terrorists were no longer interested in negotiating with the Federal Government, saying that N100m was required to free those in captivity.\n\nHe said they were still pleading with the terrorists to reduce the ransom as some of them could not afford the huge amount.\n\nHe noted, \u201cMy loved one has not been released, those that were released paid N100m. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. The kidnappers got in touch with us. They said they were no longer negotiating with the Federal Government. Getting N100m is the dilemma many of us don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the seven persons released by the terrorists have reunited with their families on Saturday evening.\n\nThey include Bosede Olurotimi, Abubakar Zubairu, Alhassan Sule, Sadiq Abdullahi, Muhammad Paki, Aliyu Usman as well as a Pakistani, Dr. Muhammad Afzal.\n\nA victim, Sadique, who is the son of former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, broke down in tears while thanking God for regaining his freedom.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers were considerate enough to hand us over to Tukur Mamu, the lead negotiator after we insisted that we will not go with them. The most difficult job has been done by him. Alhamdulillah(Praise be to God).\n\n\u201cWe were all taken to his office and even before then, he has contacted all our family members to come and pick us up. I can confirm to you that this man did this thing alone because even our family members were taken by surprise. They least expected the rescue soon, more so, that today (Saturday) is Sallah day,\u201d Sadiq added.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to hasten efforts to ensure that the remaining 43 passengers were released as soon as possible \u201cbecause of their deteriorating health condition.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the terrorists were demanding N100m, the negotiator, Manu, told The PUNCH that the government was in a better position to answer that(question) as all the terrorists wanted as their demands had to be forwarded to the government.\n\nMamu said, \u201cI sent the list to the government but honestly, there was nothing that was done. It was as a result of that that they (terrorists) threatened this attack (on Kuje prison) and eventually they succeeded in rescuing dozens of them(terrorists) instead of only 10.\n\n\u201cI think the government should explain that because it has been communicated to the government.\u201d\n\nMamu commended the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni over what he described as his \u201cbehind the scene role\u201d in the release of the seven hostages.\n\nHe said, \u201cSincerely, I have so much respect for Governor Buni. From the information I have, there is no single Yobe citizen left in that forest but that governor demonstrated an uncommon concern on this issue.\n\n\u201cHe has been in touch with me throughout, monitoring development and even reaching out to those concerned whenever there is a need to do so.\n\n\u201cHe gave lots of support. This is a governor from the North-East far from the North-West where we have this crisis. He told me not to publicise his efforts but I had to.\u201d\n\nThe Spokesman, Department of State Service, Dr Peter Afunanya, declined comment on the terrorists\u2019 demand when contacted on the phone.\n\nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, simply said he was not aware of the negotiations with the kidnappers.\n\nThe leader of the victims\u2019 families, Dr Abdulfatai Jimoh, told one of our correspondents that after the release of the seven hostages on Saturday, 43 more hostages were still in the terrorists\u2019 den.\n\nBut a security consultant, Mr Chidi Omeje, said the nation is in a messy situation, noting that the ransom would further empower the terrorists to further their criminal enterprise.\n\nAnother analyst, Jackson Ojo queried what he described as the government\u2019s lackadaisical attitude to security issues, wondering why the security agencies cannot track down the hoodlums who are in constant communication with Mamu.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that we are in a country where miscreants called terrorists to dictate to our government. The maximum number of these terrorists cannot be more than a hundred thousand; so why will this little number dictate to a government that governs over 200 million people?\u201d he asked.",

I realized that my decision will enable Asiwaju have more latitude to give more accommodation and inclusion that will position our party to win the coming elections, with the support of the people of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn stepping down, I believe I can still serve our party and the country in several other capacities.\n\n\u201cI wish to confirm that I have submitted my withdrawal letter and affidavit to that effect as the Vice Presidential Candidate to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed TInubu in the coming elections.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of myself and family, I wish to sincerely thank Asiwaju Tinubu \u2014 the Incoming President, Insha Allah \u2014 for his trust in me and we promise to remain steadfast in our support for him and the party.\u201d\n\nShettima\u2019s choice\n\nAnd announcing Masari\u2019s replacement Sunday during a media party at the Daura residence of President Muhammadu Buhari, Asiwaju Tinubu said his choice of Senator Shettima as his running mate would help him achieve good governance.\n\nThe APC flag bearer arrived Daura Sunday afternoon to pay Sallah homage to President Buhari who arrived his home town Friday.\n\nShettima, a serving lawmaker and close associate of Tinubu, has been a staunch supporter and campaigner for the choice of former Lagos state governor as the next president.\n\nHe toured many states with Tinubu since December 2021 where he addressed party delegates and mobilised support for the former lawmaker.\n\nAnnouncing the decision in a statement, Director Media and Communications Tinubu Campaign Organisation Bayo Onanuga said as governor of Borno state between 2011 and 2019, the 56-year-old Shettima ran his government on the similar template used by Bola Tinubu in Lagos.\n\n\u201cDespite the Boko Haram insurgency, he was able to build world class schools, housing and he also tapped on Human Resources outside his state.\n\n\u201cAmong his closest aides were an Ibo Christian from Anambra State in the Southeast, an Urhobo Christian from Delta State in the South-South, a Christian from Edo State in the South-South, a Yoruba Christian from the Southwest, a Fulani man from Gombe in the northeast and a Hausa man from Zamfara State in the northwest.\n\n\u201cHe was born on the 2 September, 1966 to the family of Sir Kashim Ibrahim. He is married to Nana Shettima, and they have three children: two females and a male.\n\n\u201cIn a Wikipedia biography, Sen. Kashim attended Lamisula Primary School in Maiduguri from 1972 to 1978; Government Community Secondary School, Biu in southern part of Borno State from 1978 to 1980; transferred to Government Science Secondary School, Potiskum (now in neighbouring Yobe State) where he completed his secondary education in 1983. He studied at the University of Maiduguri and earned a Degree (BSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1989. He had his one-year compulsory membership of the National Youths Service Corps, NYSC, at the defunct Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative Bank, Calabar, capital of Cross River State in South-South, Nigeria, from 1989 to 1990.\n\n\u201cHe obtained a master\u2019s degree (MSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1991 at the University of Ibadan in Southwest, Nigeria. Shettima joined the University of Maiduguri as a Lecturer with the Department of Agricultural Economics and was in the academia from 1991 to 1993,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMy basis \u2013 Tinubu\n\nJustifying Shettima\u2019s choice in a personally signed statement obtained by Blueprint in Abuja Sunday, Asiwaju Tinubu said the latter \u201cis the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nTinubu said to re-envision and reshape Nigeria, \u201cI must compose the best team possible, a team put together with but one overriding purpose: to forever establish just, capable, and compassionate governance for the people of Nigeria without regard to religion, region, or ethnic origin.\n\n\u201cIn the weeks since becoming the presidential candidate and standard-bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), I have been touched as Nigerians from all walks of life have demonstrated their faith in my capacity to lead this country. I thank you for the outpourings of support for they reveal to me the hope you hold for this nation\u2019s greatness. As long as we walk together and work together, we shall arrive at our national greatness together. To this glad and great endeavour, I fully devote myself and my future labour.\n\n\u201cIn full compliance with existing law and regulation, I submitted all necessary documents regarding my nomination as the APC presidential candidate to INEC. But, as was expected, the choice of my vice presidential running mate remained an open and burning question. This gave rise to much speculation and debate.\n\n\u201cRecent events [the voluntary withdrawal of my dear friend and brother Ibrahim Masari] mean that I am called upon, today, to put an end to the speculation. I have never been an indecisive man and have no present intention to become one.\u201d\n\nHe said decisions regarding the team around and supporting him had always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cWhen I was Governor of Lagos State, these principles helped me assemble one of the most capable governing cabinets any state or this nation has ever seen. I trust enough in these principles to allow them to, once more, guide me to construct another exemplary team that can do Nigeria proud.\n\n\u201cSecond, this chapter in our country\u2019s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach, a path already chartered by the progressive ethos of the APC. The foundation for sustainable progress has been laid these past seven years by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The challenges of today are consequential because the lives and livelihoods of millions of Nigerians lie in the balance. Visionary and creative leadership will take us to our goal.\n\n\u201cOur focus, therefore, must be on getting the job done; and that means getting the very best and competent people to do it. In this crucial moment, where so much is at stake, we must prioritize leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations,\u201d he further said.\n\nIn this regard, he said the former Borno state governor \u201cis the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region.\n\n\u201cMay I say this to all of you, especially to those who will be disappointed in my selection based on religious considerations. I will not and cannot ignore the religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of our people. Taking them into due consideration is an important part of good and able governance.\n\n\u201cBut religion, ethnicity and region cannot always and fully determine our path. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds. We must recalibrate our political calculations to where competence and fairness matter more than reductive demographics.\n\n\u201cThis is why, today, I announce the selection of SENATOR KASHIM SHETTIMA as my partner and running mate in the mission to advance and reclaim the fortunes of this great country and the hopes of its people.\u201d\n\nDuo are moderate Muslims \u2013 Okechukwu\n\nAnd in his reaction, Director General Voice of Nigeria (VON) Osita Okechukwu described the choice of Shettima as the best, saying both the presidential candidate and his running mate are moderate Muslims.\n\nOkechukwu, an APC chieftain, had consistently kicked against the Muslim-Muslim ticket, saying there are Christians in Sokoto, Taraba and Kebbi among other northern states.\n\nBut making a U-turn, the VON boss said: \u201cThe choice of Distinguished Senator Kassim Shettima as Vice Presidential Candidate; methinks it is an excellent joint ticket.\n\n\u201cAn excellent joint ticket because Distinguished Shettima is transparent, man of action and capable as Asiwaju pointed out. He did well as governor of Borno State and did a good pick as a successor in the person of Professor Zulum.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket, as a Christian one would had preferred Muslim-Christian ticket; however there was the likely input of Northern Governors who are staunch supporters of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\n\u201cAnd as a veteran politician Asiwaju must had weighed all the options among which is competence, capability and reliability and sterling qualities must had guided his choice.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that both are moderate Muslims, not ultra Muslims.\u201d\n\nLadoja weighs in\n\nMeanwhile, former Oyo state Governor Rashidi Ladoja has said politicians in the country only used religion to divide Nigerians ahead the 2023 general elections .\n\nLadoja, who is the Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, said this Sunday during a chat with journalists in Ibadan.\n\nHe said there is nothing bad in electing Muslim as Nigeria President and the running mate in the next political dispensation come 2023, urging Nigerians to shun religious differences in electing their leaders.\n\n\u201cNigerian politicians are just using religion to divide the citizens, religion should not be an issue among the people. There is no need for Nigerians to fight themselves over religion as both the Muslims and Christians are one.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

This was made known in a statement made available to the media yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, REA Mr. Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad explained that the framework underpinned by the MoU between both parties, is expected to be implemented in a sustainable and impactful manner, while also addressing one of the Agency\u2019s strategic objectives \u2013 to promote electricity consumption for \u201cproductive use\u201d in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe MoU will mutually benefit both the REA and FADAMA. Both parties are keen to unlock the economic potential in agrarian communities, through the provision of electricity solutions for agro-processing and irrigation schemes\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe MoU will ensure timely communication and cooperation during the implementation stage of the programme, including support (where applicable) in conducting field surveys, monitoring/supervision and impact assessments.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Technical Services, REA Barka Sajou said that subsequently the agro-energy programme, as well as other proposed programmes under the framework, will be implemented to demonstrate opportunities for the private sector.\n\nAnd based on the lessons learned, viable agriculture-energy solutions and business models can be adopted and scaled commercially.\n\nThe MoU is also expected to consider the Agency\u2019s recently-launched Energizing Agricultural Programme EAP.\n\nThe EAP is a three-year initiative with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet GEAPP, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation that aims to stimulate the use of mini-grid electricity in agricultural productive uses.\n\nThese \u201cAgro-Energy\u201d programmes are intended to provide electricity for productive use and unlock the economic potential/activities in rural and agrarian communities alike.\n\nSo far, the Agency has communicated and cooperated with stakeholders during the pre-implementation stage, including support in conducting desktop and field surveys to identify viable sites.\n\nMore specifically, and in line with REA\u2019s proposed agro-energy programmes, the NFDP\u2019s component 2 (Small Scale Community Owned Infrastructure) aims to rehabilitate surface water and construct new small-scale irrigation schemes and borehole schemes, as well as other groundwater irrigation schemes and infrastructure support.

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",
          "summary": "By Palma IleyeDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\nWhen you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition.\nAnd our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value.\nWhen you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\nAlso we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

          "title": "IOCs Killing Local Oil Servicing Companies in Nigeria, Says Wabote",
          "text": "The Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote has taken a swipe at international oil companies (IOCs) operating in the country, urging them to stop the maltreatment of indigenous firms in the sector.\n\nSpeaking at the just-concluded Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) in Abuja, Wabote stated that as the IOCs complain about the inclement business environment, they must also take cognisance of their negative attitude towards local oil servicing companies.\n\nSpecifically, the NCDMB helmsman told the oil majors to promptly pay for contracts with the local entities and stop giving excuses even when they (IOCs) initiated the deals.\n\nIn some cases, Wabote lamented that the local firms were required to form consortiums, sign performance bonds after borrowing from the banks, noting that if the IOCs should come into equity, then they must come with clean hands.\n\nReacting to one of the remarks by one of the IOCs that Nigerian firms in the oil industry should form groups to present a stronger front, Wabote noted that beyond that, the oil majors must begin to treat local firms with dignity, explaining that forming consortiums was not a magic wand.\n\n\u201cSo creating a consortium is not a magic wand. It requires all the serious commitments to have a project of that magnitude. While there are challenges in doing business in Nigeria, I think we all have a share of the blame and we must accept that. When we are talking, we need to put that on the table,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to him, in the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, many costs by service providers were reviewed downwards. However, Wabote explained that since oil price hit new heights, there had been no plan to increase it for local companies.\n\n\u201cI give you an example, some of the companies, when oil price came down, the IOCs and the NNPC (Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation) demanded a 40 per cent reduction in costs.\n\n\u201cSome of them were providing them vessels for about $20,000 to $25,000 per day. We negotiated down to $12,000 or $15,000 per day and they did that because they wanted to remain in business. Oil price was $27 and at some point it was negative. Now, it\u2019s $110, where is the marching order to renegotiate those contracts with those local operators?\n\n\u201cOn top of that they still squeeze them, but because there are no jobs and jobs are limited, you cannot park your facility in your garage, even if you do it somewhere, you still spend money to do so.\n\n\u201cOut of that, these companies still struggle and make little or nothing in terms of margins. They have to service loans. So the onus is also on the IOCs and service providers to say, this is what is possible.\n\n\u201cIf you leave it to me, I will fix a price to it because it has to move in tandem with the oil price. When it goes up, it should also go up with service providers vice versa. That\u2019s the way to keep local businesses from going underground,\u201d he argued.\n\nOn the issue of piling debts, the NCDMB boss stated that it was unfair for the IOCs to initiate contracts and not pay for upwards of six months, stressing that Nigeria Agip Oil Company (NAOC) remains a major culprit.\n\n\u201cThe other one is about payments. We don\u2019t pay these local contractors. They work six months and don\u2019t get paid. I don\u2019t think NAOC is here because they are the biggest culprits.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, they will demand for the service and the local companies will provide them the service, but when it is time to pay, the don\u2019t. When I ask questions they say their joint venture partners have not paid their cash calls.\n\n\u201cSo, why did they demand for the service? Why didn\u2019t they wait until they get the cash calls payments? These companies are going under because they take loans, they do the business, but by the time you pay them, the capital and the profit are all gone,\u201d Wabote lamented.\n\nHe noted that the situation had become so bad that he had been joined in several lawsuits by the affected companies even though the NCDMB had no hand in such bad deals.\n\n\u201cSo these are things we need to also address. As we point fingers, we should also look inwards in terms of making sure that local businesses also survive because at times I can tell you I wasn\u2019t joking when I said I get sued in court as a co-defendant because Agip is not paying and in some certain instances, they put my name to appear in court.\n\n\u201cSometimes they call me to intervene and I call the companies and say why are you not paying, they say, we are not being paid cash call. But you give out the service to these people who will take loans to provide the service.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a two-way street. While we are talking about ease of doing business, those are the factors that make doing business a lot more difficult. If you\u2019re paying me and I am dealing with the community and dealing with all those, I don\u2019t care, so long as I am getting the money to solve the problems.\n\n\u201cBut if you are not paying me and these problems are there, it is actually frustrating and I feel their pain,\u201d he added.\n\nWabote further posited that the entire industry needed to come together to address the outstanding issues \u201cso that we can get local businesses to continue to do business rather than just wither away.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

This is because, aside being governor for eight years, a period that shows no outstanding development strides, nothing seems to have qualified Shettima more than the others that were bypassed for him, especially, the governors from the North West.\n\nTherefore, if it was about competence and capacity for the job, there was no way Shettima could have defeated other preferable choices from areas with better electoral value.\n\nTo put in context,l his electoral value, as at the 2019 elections, the voting strength of North West alone was over 20 million, representing 24% of the national spread, while the North East boasted a little over 11 million votes, which represented 13.44%.\n\nTalking about religious balance, which has also become an even more sensitive issue, given the rise in terrorism and other forms of insecurity, believed to have assumed a religious slant, the choice of Shettima has been considered even more insensitive to the current realities in the country as much as the existential fault lines.\n\nBut, Tinubu, who was in Daura, Katsina State, on Sunday, to spend time with President Buhari, during the Eid-el-Kabir celebration, also seized the opportunity of the visit to talk about his partner, stating that, the spirit of the 1993 presidential election, which presented the nation with a rare Muslim-Muslim combination, had come upon the nation in the 2023 polls.\n\nInside sources claimed that, Tinubu, had long submitted a list of possible running mates to the president for some time, which Buhari refused to act on.\n\nTinubu, then, seized the initiative since deadline is Friday, July 15, and formally announced Shettima before the date.\n\nExpectedly, the announcement has begun to create a row in the party, as some of the governors, who worked tirelessly to ensure Tinubu clinched the ticket, considered the manner he broke the news \u2018arrogant\u2019 and against the understanding he had with them.\n\nTo this end, the governors, a majority of them from the North West, have scheduled to visit the president in Daura, on Tuesday to formally register their displeasure, before taking further steps.\n\nThis appears to be the start of a new crisis for Tinubu as some members of the party have started to react to the development. While Senator Ishaku Abbo from Adamawa State, has allegedly resigned from all Tinubu\u2019s campaign groups, another member of the party and legal practitioner, Bwala Daniel, has resigned from the party, because Tinubu\u2019s choice was insensitive to the unity of the country.\n\nThis, nonetheless, other party stakeholders, including the governors, were said to have got into another battle of sorts with Tinubu over his suggestion that he would not mind making a former national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, the director-general of his presidential campaign, as they all objected to the idea.\n\nIn a related development, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2023 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has cautioned against exclusionist politics in the coming dispensation, saying he considered politics as a corrective mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, the Presiding Bishop, Christian Global Network, (CGN), Taiwo Akinola, has stated that the same-faith ticket embraced by the APC and its candidate, Tinubu, would further entrench national division, because the church was deeply concerned about the potential consequences of such an arrangement, \u201cthus, we hereby speak up against it before it becomes too late.\u201d\n\nGovernors Angry over Decision, Meet Buhari Today in Daura\n\nAside the governors, Senator Abbo, from Adamawa, who was on some of the Tinubu support groups and committees, has sent a scathing message to the group, in which he expressed his disappointment in Tinubu, for going against popular counsel to choose a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAbbo, who promised to formally send in his letters today, said if as an ordinary citizen, Tunubu has refused to listen to counsel, then, he would be worse as president and subsequently resigned his membership of all the committees.\n\nSimilarly, a lawyer and member of the party, Daniel, who tweeted via his verified account @BwalaDaniel, immediately after the unveiling of Shettima, posted: \u201cTonight, I officially resigned my membership of @OfficialAPCng on principles and conviction that I hold so dear. At this time of our national existence, our efforts and energy should gravitate towards uniting our people\n\n\u201cAsiwaju has announced Kashim Shettima as his running mate. Kwankwaso is planning to announce a Pentecostal bishop as his running mate. Interesting times lie ahead.\u201d\n\nTinubu while stressing that the APC would win the 2023 election, he said he selected Shettima,\u201dbecause he is competent, capable, reliable and able.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if APC was in the right condition to win the election, the standard standard bearer said, \u201cWe are gonna win. Insha Allah. We\u2019re gonna win.\u201d\n\nTinubu also issued a detailed statement on his new partner and why he settled for him.\n\nTinubu: Why I Chose Shettima\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, we enter a moment of renewed hope. We hold the chance to move the nation and our collective cause forward as never before. Let us seize this moment so that history may write kindly of us. It is time to focus with utmost devotion and love of country to do all we can do to advance the ideals of democratic and progressive good governance in the land.\n\n\u201cWe must end poverty and bring greater prosperity and more lasting peace. Let us be wise of thought yet courageous in action, as we embark on a collective enterprise that brings jobs, education, food, medicine, hope and belief in a better life to those who need them.\n\n\u201cI stand ready to begin this journey with you, hopefully, to lead the nation on this needed path as your next President by the grace of God. I believe this is a pivotal moment at which the dynamics of history and destiny call us forth to reshape our beloved nation. This is our moment.\n\n\u201cWe all must answer the nation\u2019s call. For some, this requires of us that we step forward, assuming new roles and responsibilities. For others, it may mean something else. For all of us, it requires that we dedicate ourselves to the collective national task as never before.\n\n\u201cTo re-envision and reshape the nation, I must compose the best team possible, a team put together with but one overriding purpose: to forever establish just, capable, and compassionate governance for the people of Nigeria without regard to religion, region, or ethnic origin.\n\n\u201cIn full compliance with existing law and regulation, I submitted all necessary documents regarding my nomination as the APC presidential candidate to INEC. But, as was expected, the choice of my Vice Presidential running mate remained an open and burning question. This gave rise to much speculation and debate.\n\n\u201cRecent events (the voluntary withdrawal of my dear friend and brother Ibrahim Masari)mean that I am called upon, today, to put an end to the speculation. I have never been an indecisive man and have no present intention to become one.\n\n\u201cWhat I am, however, is a democrat. And a democrat must listen to, and consult with, the people and his advisors so that he may reform and govern wisely and on their behalf. This I have done. My political career was not built on blind indifference to the views of others.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the perspectives of leading members of the party, political allies and key national figures who see Nigeria\u2019s future as I do. They gave me their views so that I might add their valuable insights to mine to reach the best decision possible and do so in a manner that strengthens the institutional fabric of our party as well as accelerating the evolution of our political democracy.\n\n\u201cHaving now listened to the sage, careful advice of a broad section of the party and of the nation, there are a few points I feel I must make about the exceptional and extraordinary person with whom I will share the APC ticket and the principles of open and good governance that informed this choice.\n\n\u201cI realize the momentous times we have entered. I know what lies in the balance. I also know that our political choices and activities send both intended and unintended signals to portions of the Nigerian electorate.\n\n\u201cAll my life, my decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cOur focus, therefore, must be on getting the job done; and that means getting the very best and competent people to do it. In this crucial moment, where so much is at stake, we must prioritize leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations.\n\n\u201cI am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate. Just and noble people have talked to me about this. Some have counselled that I should select a Christian to please the Christian community. Other have said I should pick a Muslim to appeal to the Muslim community. Clearly, I cannot do both.\n\n\u201cBoth sides of the debate have impressive reason and passionate arguments supporting their position. Both arguments are right in their own way. But neither is right in the way that Nigeria needs at the moment. As president, I hope to govern this nation toward uncommon progress. This will require innovation. It will require steps never before taken. It will also require decisions that are politically difficult and rare.\n\n\u201cIf I am to be that type of President, I must begin by being that type of candidate. Let me make the bold and innovative decision not to win political points but to move the nation and our party\u2019s campaign closer to the greatness that we were meant to achieve. Here is where politics ends, and true leadership must begin.\n\n\u201cToday, I announce my selection with pride, because I have made it not based on religion or to please one community or the other. I made this choice because I believe this is the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region.\n\n\u201cThis is why, today, I announce the selection of Senator Kashim Shettima as my partner and running mate in the mission to advance and reclaim the fortunes of this great country and the hopes of its people.\n\n\u201cSenator Kasim Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the vice president. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith.\n\n\u201cI am aware that many will continue focus on a particular detail, the question of his faith. However, if we truly understand the challenges upon us a nation, then we must also see the imperative of placing competence in governance above religious sentiment.\n\n\u201cIn 1993, Nigerians embrace Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe in one of our fairest elections ever held. The spirit of 1993 is upon us again in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs such, the ticket we present today represents a milestone in our political history. It symbolizes our party\u2019s determination to be a leading light among political parties in Africa. The democratic process and the decorum that characterised our presidential primaries and the selection of our vice presidential candidate exemplifies why we are the party of the people and of the betterment of their future.\n\n\u201cWith this selection, the All Progressives Congress surely shall continue to be the party that shows the way and carries this nation towards its best future. I implore you all to join with me on this journey to a brighter future.\u201d\n\nBut the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has said it was left for the Nigerian electorate to decide on the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.\n\nIn it\u2019s reaction to the announcement by Tinubu that he had settled for a Muslim running mate, the Media Assistant to the CSN president, Adebayo Ayodeji, said: \u201cIt is clear that the situation in the country now is not conducive for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIt is up to Nigerians to accept or reject. Today\u2019s Nigeria is not the same when Nigerians voted Abiola-Kingibe ticket, which was eventually annulled. Our prayers are with Nigeria and Nigerians.\u201d\n\nYet, in his reaction, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, SAN, who said, \u201cHE Sen. Kashim Shettima is the perfect choice as VP\u201d, described him thus: \u201cQuintessential banker and economist, suave gentleman and politician, intellectually fertile, economically sound, intergenerationally mobile (he\u2019s young, yet experienced), fiercely loyal, phenomenally complimentary to @officialABAT.\u201d\n\nHow Tinubu Fought for Shettima\n\nSettling for Shettima seemed as difficult as Tinubu\u2019s emergence as the APC presidential candidate, but sources in the party claimed that, Tinubu knew all along that a Muslim-Muslim was his best bet, but the religious politics introduced to it as well as the position of the governors, was what delayed the announcement as he sought more time to convince people to buy into Muslim-Muslim idea, before picking the lucky candidate.\n\nWhile the governors were not very keen about the role of religion in the pairing, they, at many of their meetings with Tinubu, objected to the idea of running with a former governor since Tinubu himself is a former governor.\n\nTo that extent, the governors said while Tinubu as the candidate represents the former governors on the ticket, he should pair with a sitting member of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, for some sort of balancing, which they reckoned would give them a sense of belonging in the Tinubu administration, if he won.\n\nThus, they suggested to him, either the Governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, a Muslim, or his Plateau State counterpart, Simon Lalong, a Christian. But they both represent the class of the sitting governors as NGF members.\n\nYet, they saw problem with the choice of Zulum, since his benefactor and predecessor, Shettima, is also in consideration for the job and might set them against each other. Besides, some had also argued that cancelling out Zulum would not be as difficult since he had personally come out to opt out of the consideration for running mate to Tinubu.\n\nIn a statement widely circulated, Zulum, had thanked those touting his name as possible running mate to the APC candidate, saying if there was anything he wanted, it was to return to Borno to finish off the development he had started and this position, he was said to have personally relayed to Tinubu, when he visited Borno to poach delegates ahead of the convention,\n\nWhen it was clear to the governors that Tinubu was not comfortable with the two suggestions (Zulum and Lalong), sources said, they further suggested to him another sitting governor, albeit from North West, he quickly retorted that he could never pair with the particular governor, who many people, including his colleagues considered controversial.\n\nAccording to the source, Tinubu told them that he could not afford to have the very governor in question in a position he could not fire or reprimand him, whenever he misbehaves, hence, he did not think it was smart to pair with him on the presidential ticket, knowing he would be protected by immunity.\n\nBut, with the deadline staring them in the face, Tinubu, did not relent on his push for Shettima as he continued to call the governors and other stakeholders, seeking their consent on the choice of the former Borno State governor, whom many believed had since positioned himself for the job.\n\nEven more instructive is the fact that, while many of the governors wanted one of them to be on the ticket, they were willing to defer to Tinubu on his choice for running mate, since he\u2019s the candidate.\n\nHowever, after securing the tacit consent of the governors and other stakeholders, who were also of the view that the candidate should be allowed to choose whoever he could work with, Tinubu then went for Shettima, whom he had always wanted and also resolved to brief Buhari on his choice partner, before a formal announcement is made ahead of the deadline this Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, another hurdle more difficult to cross for Tinubu is the thinking he could make Oshiomhole, an intending senator, his campaign DG, an idea, which has been roundly rejected by almost everyone he has broached it with.\n\nTinubu, while meeting with some of the stakeholders, the governors inclusive, had mooted the idea of appointing Oshiomhole to lead his campaign. But the people he ran the idea by immediately protested, saying Oshiomhole would kill his presidential dream.\n\nBut the presidential candidate had given as his reason for wanting an Oshiomhole to lead his campaign, the \u201cneed for a mad man\u201d that could contain the opposition, intimidate them and lead the party to a resounding victory in 2023.\n\nBut they immediately told him that, while they agreed that Oshiomhole had the stamina, he was too combative and disruptive to undertake such an assignment, adding also that as a southerner presidential candidate, picking a southerner as DG, especially, after a Muslim-Muslim ticket, might have begun to awkwardly tilt the balance and present a wrong impression overall \u2013 to the voting populace.\n\nInstead, they suggested a Christian northerner, in which case could be one of them \u2013 talking about Lalong of Plateau \u2013 or any other prominent Christian northerner, who is not seeking an elective office, so he could concentrate on the campaign 100 per cent.\n\nTherefore, while the issue of running mate might have been finally laid to rest with Shettima fitting Tinubu\u2019s bill, the choice of who becomes the DG has yet to be addressed as the party gears up for campaign proper.\n\n\u2018Same-Faith Ticket Will Further Entrench National Division\u2019\n\nPresiding Bishop, Christian Global Network, (CGN), Taiwo Akinola, has warned that, the same-faith ticket would further entrench national division, noting that the church is deeply concerned about the potential consequences of such an arrangement, \u201cthus, we hereby speak up against it before it becomes too late.\u201d\n\nAkinola, who disclosed this Sunday in Ota, Ogun State, during the new wine/fresh fire conference organised by Christ Global Network (CGN) in Rhema Christian Church and Towers, said political calculations sometimes necessitate veryHe, therefore, urged all major political parties, APC, PDP, and LP parties, and their candidates that same-faith candidature was not a route to take at all especially, in a country where religion is one of the major dividing lines, alongside ethnicity and region.\n\nHe also noted that it should be well taken that a Muslim-Muslim ticket would unwittingly fuel a further cry against the real or preconceived allegations of an Islamisation agenda, and furthermore worsen the prevalent political and religious crisis.\n\nHe remarked that it was commonsensical and a patriotic appreciation of Nigeria\u2019s religious diversity, therefore, to totally avoid it.\n\nAkinola remarked that the insecurity challenges in the country were tainted with religious colouration, and as such, urged all major political parties to strike a balance along religious lines for peaceful co-existence.\n\nHe expressed displeasure that the political structure in the country was designed in such a manner that politicians only focus on strategies for winning elections, not minding if they lose the country in the end.\n\n\u201cI must say that we are very much relieved and highly enthused to note that quite a number of fair-minded Muslims and other patriotic Nigerians, have equally spoken out plainly to condemn any Muslim-Muslim ticket contemplation, knowing that such could not be in the best interest of our dear country Nigeria. And, it is a wise thing to do for all of us to commend and to emulate this gesture.\n\n\u201cWe can say it without fear of contradictions that some of those pushing this inconsiderate agenda are doing so for their selfish ends only, not because they wish their candidates or even the nation well. To my mind, no patriotic Nigerian will vote for an arrangement that could spell doom for the country. Moreover, it is even a crass assumption to think that any normal Christian will even contemplate to vote for an Islamic mono-candidature in today\u2019s Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith all these, our candid advice is that all political parties should jettison all Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian permutations. It is insensitive, immoral, unjust, grossly disrespectful to the faith of others, conspicuously suspicious, and tendentious to violence, and we pray it fails.\u201d",

I believe that a socialist or socialist-led coalition government at the next election would be a disaster for the UK,\u201d Mordaunt said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe must win the next election.\u201d\n\nThe Conservative Party\u2019s 1922 Committee of legislators, which sets rules for the party in parliament, would set out the exact timetable after a meeting on Monday.\n\nBob Blackman, an officer on the 1922 Committee\u2019s executive, said that nominations would close on Tuesday evening, followed by a process to whittle candidates down to a final two by July 21.\n\nParty members would elect a new party leader over the summer, who would then become prime minister.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll (select the final two) by the 21st of July, to allow the party membership sufficient time to have husting sessions and a postal ballot to then lead to a new leader being in place by the fifth of September,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nEntering the race, Shapps, Zahawi, Hunt and Javid all pledged tax cuts, setting them against current favourite, former finance minister Rishi Sunak, whose budget last year put Britain on course for its biggest tax burden since the 1950s.\n\n\u201cI believe in a lower tax, lower regulation, cut-the-red-tape economy,\u201d Shapps told Sky News, adding he would hold an emergency budget to bring forward a one pence reduction in the income tax rate which is currently planned in 2024, freeze a planned rise in corporation tax and look to reduce the size of the civil service.\n\nHunt, a former foreign minister who came second in the leadership contest in 2019 when Johnson came to office, and Javid, who twice resigned from Johnson\u2019s government, both said they would cut corporation tax to 15 per cent.\n\nHunt said no Conservative should either raise taxes or offer unfunded tax cuts.\n\nAsked if cutting taxes would lead to inflation, Hunt said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that when it comes to business taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you stimulate consumer demand, when there\u2019s some demand-led inflation, there is that risk, but we must bear down on inflation. That\u2019s why I\u2019d be very careful not to promise (tax) cuts that would stoke inflation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday said Foreign Secretary Liz Truss would launch her campaign on Monday with a promise to cut taxes and tackle the cost-of-living crisis, while one of her main rivals for the role, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, has ruled himself out.",
