          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nFlooding of the Ojo-Afeje community in the Sari-Iganmu area of Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area of Lagos, especially during the rainy season, has become a regular annual occurrence. Residents of the area are, however, lamenting the effects of the incessant flood and poor drainage system on their houses and health. AMARACHI OKEH reports\n\nPa Safarudeen Soremekun is an old resident of the Ojo-Afeje community. He built his house in the area over 26 years ago.\n\nAccording to Pa Soremekun, in the first few years of his stay in the community, there was no problem, but not long after then, flooding became a yearly problem in the area.\n\nSince the flooding began years ago \u2013 due to indiscriminate development of houses and the conversion of the community\u2019s canal to a dumping site \u2013 Pa Soremekun said he and other residents have continued to suffer huge losses in personal possessions, while also watching helplessly as their properties get destroyed.\n\nHe noted that while most residents of the area have become accustomed to living in the community, he is not unmindful of the health risk that comes with residing in such an environment.\n\nPa Soremekun added that due to the flooding, three out of the bedrooms in his apartment are usually evacuated, as the floods make the rooms their home yearly.\n\nA first-time visitor to the Ojo-Afeje community will see nothing but a sorry sight of deprivation and squalor.\n\nThis dingy community is dotted by old houses, the backyards of most of which have been abandoned by residents as they have become marshy due to flooding.\n\nWhile a few houses still stand firm, most are noticeably slanted, sinking into the ground.\n\nA visit to the area by our correspondent also revealed that many houses in the community have been abandoned and overtaken by pools of water that have now turned green.\n\nParadoxically, while Ojo-Afeje is barely habitable, the community is flowing with residents in their hundreds. The residents are mostly petty traders.\n\nAs sad as the situation is, many of the residents say they cannot leave, as they cannot afford to rent new houses. Others say they cannot leave the homes they have built.\n\nWhen PUNCH HealthWise visited Pa Soremekun\u2019s home recently after a recent flooding that occurred in the Lagos metropolis, the sitting room still smelt of dampness. Also, the only seat available was noticeably still wet and lined with growing moulds.\n\nThe 91-year-old lamented, \u201cEvery year we swim inside this dirty water; is it good?\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for anything more than for the government to take care of the community and the environment.\n\n\u201cLook at my house \u2013 even my bedroom is flooded, but we have to manage it like that. There\u2019s nowhere for us to go. I built this house years ago before this flooding began.\n\n\u201cMy children have been asking me to leave but I cannot leave. This is my house, I built it.\u201d\n\nHe pleaded with the government to come to the community\u2019s help, saying, \u201cEven if it\u2019s only the gutter that they will do for us, we will be happy. We are only asking for a drainage system here,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nThe situation at Pa Soremekun\u2019s home mirrors the experience of some other residents in the community who were seen scooping buckets of water from their rooms.\n\nPoor drainage system\n\nOther residents who spoke with PUNCH HealthWise said the major reason houses in the community get flooded is due to the lack of a drainage system.\n\nThis flooding is also worsened by the canal that has been blocked by a heap of waste that also serves as a home and business place for scavengers.\n\nThe blocked canal is basically now a refuse dump, filled with filth above sea level. Thus the drainage channel that is supposed to run through the canal empties itself into the community that is now below sea level.\n\nThe residents say despite the alert by NiMet they cannot leave as they have nowhere to go.\n\nA female resident who craved anonymity said the flooding in the area is always very severe.\n\n\u201cSometimes the water gets to our waists. Water chases people from their homes here, especially those that live in front. Sometimes you\u2019d even hear the sound of a house collapsing.\u201d\n\nOn the health implication of the flooding, another female resident said, \u201cThe health conditions that people in the community suffer the most during the rainy season is typhoid, malaria and athlete\u2019s foot.\u201d She extending her athlete\u2019s foot infested feet for the reporter to see.\n\n\u201cThe water enters people\u2019s houses but to say it causes cholera, no,\u201d she said with certainty,\n\n\u201cI have not seen any case of cholera in all the years I have lived here.\n\nThis was also reiterated by other residents.\n\nHowever, a nurse at the Primary Health Care centre located on Zion Street in Ojo-Afeje said that in addition to malaria and typhoid, the residents also suffer from other health conditions.\n\nAnother resident, who pleaded anonymity, said the flooding started when developers building houses blocked the drainage system. He added that this has been happening for more than 10 years now.\n\nHe also said that some roads in the area had been repeatedly tarred but they keep getting bad and \u201cany tangible project the government tries to do cannot be concluded because one way or the other floods usually spoil it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the medical director of a major hospital in Sari Iganmu, Eternal Life Hospital, Dr. UzoOnyemetara, said the flooding is severely affecting the health of the residents.\n\nHe noted that there were cases of cholera from the community last year due to the flooding but noted that no fresh cholera case has been reported this year so far.\n\nThe physician said that whenever a cholera outbreak occurs in the area, it is usually linked to the flooding and lack of good water supply, as well as non-existent sanitation.\n\nOnyemetara, who is a family physician specialist, added that to prevent the outbreak of cholera, the canal should be dredged while mobile toilets should also be set up for the residents who live in shacks on the canal.\n\nOnyemetara also said that public toilets should be built in the community, stressing that \u201cEven if they stay in shacks but there are good toilet facilities that they can pay for and water they can buy, they will do it. Just that it is not available.\u201d\n\nMere raising the alarm on flooding not good enough \u2013 Activist\n\nWhile various reports say climate change could be partly responsible for the constant flooding in places like Lagos, a director of programmes at Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa, Philip Jakpor disagrees.\n\nAccording to Jakpor, the flooding in Nigeria can be attributed to the governments not heeding the warnings by the various agencies in clearing the drainage systems and opening the canals, despite having ample time to do so.\n\nHe also stressed that reclamations and allocations of flood plains for real estate development are also part of the reasons for the flooding.\n\nHe added that \u201cIt is not enough to raise the alarm that flooding is likely to happen and then we wait and do nothing.\u201d\n\nJakpor suggested that proactive measures be taken by the government to avoid flooding, instead of just announcing that a flood is likely to occur. According to him, \u201cWhat has been responsible for the flooding is that the Lagos State government has not heeded the warnings by NiMet and NHISA by clearing the drainage and opening up the canals.\n\n\u201cThey had enough time since this warning started at the beginning of this year to ensure that the drainage systems and the canals were opened to assimilate excess water, which means that once it rains and you have the flooding, three or four hours later, the water should have subsided. This means that there is something we are not doing.\n\n\u201cThe state government is not doing enough to ensure that the canals are open and the drains are also cleared so that excess water will find its way.\u201d\n\nFlooding can cause cholera\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the impact of cholera on health, environmentalists and public health experts say that flooding, even in areas with a good water supply, could lead to periodic outbreaks of the disease.\n\nThey pointed out that cholera, while it is a water-borne disease, could also occur due to poor sanitation and the disposal of human waste.\n\nAn environmentalist, Greg Odogwu, said residents of flood-prone areas should be on the alert during rainy seasons because the outbreak in such places is periodic.\n\nHe also advocated for the use of cholera vaccines, as well as creation of water, sanitation and hygiene awareness in such areas.\n\nAnother environmentalist, Michael Simire said that the outbreak of cholera in flood-prone areas is hinged on sanitation in general and not just water sanitation.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with sanitation generally, not just water sanitation. If you have poor toilet habits; or you use the toilet and don\u2019t wash your hands very well; or your toilet system is not well disposed of, when it rains and flood overruns your cesspit, it exposes all the bad water outside.\u201d\n\nSimire added that the disposal of human waste in drainage channels could also cause cholera in flood-prone areas.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised to find out that some people throw solid human waste into the gutter and when it rains, water raises the level and people enter this water.\n\n\u201cOne way or the other it might get to you.

          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA senior Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr. James Odofin, has warned women against drinking beer or hot water to lose belly fat after delivery, noting that it does not help mothers regain pre-pregnancy abdomen size.\n\nOdofin who works at the Federal Medical Centre, Ebute Metta, also noted that applying hot water to the belly does not help women to lose belly fat after childbirth.\n\nHe stressed that women engaging in the practices, thinking they could help reduce belly fat, are only wasting their time.\n\nAccording to the gynaecologist, drinking beer or using waist trainers or girdles does not have any effect in helping new mothers regain their pre-pregnancy abdomen.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Odofin said such health practices have no inherent health benefit in them.\n\n\u201cThere are some myths and cultural practices that people think can help reduce belly fat after delivery but they are not really effective in achieving what they intend to do.\n\n\u201cTake for example that of using hot water on the abdomen. I do not see how applying hot water to your tummy will reduce either the abdominal fat gotten during pregnancy or even the size of the womb itself,\u201d he said.\n\nOdofin explained that within 10 days after birth the womb starts reverting to its normal position.\n\nHe added that all physiological changes associated with pregnancy will revert to their pre-pregnancy state six weeks post-birth.\n\n\u201cSo, there is no need of using hot water to reduce the size of the abdomen,\u201d he said.\n\nOdofin also explained that women who have a big abdomen before pregnancy will still have same post-delivery.\n\n\u201cSome people have a big \u2018tummy\u2019 before pregnancy, so pregnancy makes it look as if it has increased; but after delivery, that big tummy will still be there.\n\n\u201cWhat will the hot water do? Is it to burn the fat or what, I don\u2019t even know,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senior consultant said that there is no mechanism of action for hot water in the treatment of abdominal fat.\n\nHe also explained that a woman\u2019s abdomen will naturally snap back to its state when she starts breastfeeding her baby.\n\n\u201cGod has done it in such a way that when you are breastfeeding your baby, the oxytocin that is released usually causes some kind of abdominal cramp, similar to menstrual cramp.\n\n\u201cThat menstrual cramp feeling the woman is having during breastfeeding is what is causing what we call uterine involution \u2013 the womb is trying to reduce in size.\n\n\u201cOf course, it cannot begin to reduce in size without you feeling that something is happening. It is not a silent process, as you will feel some cramps.\n\n\u201cSo, breastfeeding will make the womb come back to its pre-pregnancy state. That is number one.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the abdominal fat \u2013which, naturally, is just what the woman gained in the course of the pregnancy \u2013 with the delivery of the baby and the placenta, all those physiologies will be reversed.\n\n\u201cSo, whatever water or fat the woman has gotten during pregnancy will begin to reduce, meaning that there\u2019s really nothing per se that the woman would need to do that will make the abdomen reduce to the pre-pregnancy stage.\n\n\u201cIt will return to the pre-pregnancy stage within six weeks. That is why some people say a woman who delivers should stay at home for 40 days. This is more common in the Yoruba culture.\n\nHe explained that within those 40 days is \u201cwhen every process and change that occurred in the course of that pregnancy will resolve itself physically, anatomically, physiologically and even emotionally. Everything will resolve back to normal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Odofin, it is not necessary to recommend medication or treatment for women after delivery to lose belly fat gained during pregnancy.\n\nHe, however, said that women who notice their abdomen being excessively large post-birth could have an anomaly such as fibroid.\n\nHe said such women after they have given birth should not expect the fibroid to disappear with the pregnancy.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA senior Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr. James Odofin, has warned women against drinking beer or hot water to lose belly fat after delivery, noting that it does not help mothers regain pre-pregnancy abdomen size.\n\nOdofin who works at the Federal Medical Centre, Ebute Metta, also noted that applying hot water to the belly does not help women to lose belly fat after childbirth.\n\nHe stressed that women engaging in the practices, thinking they could help reduce belly fat, are only wasting their time.\n\nAccording to the gynaecologist, drinking beer or using waist trainers or girdles does not have any effect in helping new mothers regain their pre-pregnancy abdomen.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Odofin said such health practices have no inherent health benefit in them.\n\n\u201cThere are some myths and cultural practices that people think can help reduce belly fat after delivery but they are not really effective in achieving what they intend to do.\n\n\u201cTake for example that of using hot water on the abdomen. I do not see how applying hot water to your tummy will reduce either the abdominal fat gotten during pregnancy or even the size of the womb itself,\u201d he said.\n\nOdofin explained that within 10 days after birth the womb starts reverting to its normal position.\n\nHe added that all physiological changes associated with pregnancy will revert to their pre-pregnancy state six weeks post-birth.\n\n\u201cSo, there is no need of using hot water to reduce the size of the abdomen,\u201d he said.\n\nOdofin also explained that women who have a big abdomen before pregnancy will still have same post-delivery.\n\n\u201cSome people have a big \u2018tummy\u2019 before pregnancy, so pregnancy makes it look as if it has increased; but after delivery, that big tummy will still be there.\n\n\u201cWhat will the hot water do? Is it to burn the fat or what, I don\u2019t even know,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senior consultant said that there is no mechanism of action for hot water in the treatment of abdominal fat.\n\nHe also explained that a woman\u2019s abdomen will naturally snap back to its state when she starts breastfeeding her baby.\n\n\u201cGod has done it in such a way that when you are breastfeeding your baby, the oxytocin that is released usually causes some kind of abdominal cramp, similar to menstrual cramp.\n\n\u201cThat menstrual cramp feeling the woman is having during breastfeeding is what is causing what we call uterine involution \u2013 the womb is trying to reduce in size.\n\n\u201cOf course, it cannot begin to reduce in size without you feeling that something is happening. It is not a silent process, as you will feel some cramps.\n\n\u201cSo, breastfeeding will make the womb come back to its pre-pregnancy state. That is number one.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the abdominal fat \u2013which, naturally, is just what the woman gained in the course of the pregnancy \u2013 with the delivery of the baby and the placenta, all those physiologies will be reversed.\n\n\u201cSo, whatever water or fat the woman has gotten during pregnancy will begin to reduce, meaning that there\u2019s really nothing per se that the woman would need to do that will make the abdomen reduce to the pre-pregnancy stage.\n\n\u201cIt will return to the pre-pregnancy stage within six weeks. That is why some people say a woman who delivers should stay at home for 40 days. This is more common in the Yoruba culture.\n\nHe explained that within those 40 days is \u201cwhen every process and change that occurred in the course of that pregnancy will resolve itself physically, anatomically, physiologically and even emotionally. Everything will resolve back to normal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Odofin, it is not necessary to recommend medication or treatment for women after delivery to lose belly fat gained during pregnancy.\n\nHe, however, said that women who notice their abdomen being excessively large post-birth could have an anomaly such as fibroid.\n\nHe said such women after they have given birth should not expect the fibroid to disappear with the pregnancy.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the reported spending of over \u20a6880 billion of public funds by 367 Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs, in 2018 without appropriation.\n\nSERAP made the request in a letter dated August 7, 2021 by it\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nThe organisation said that any such investigation should establish whether public funds have been mismanaged, diverted or stolen and anyone suspected to be responsible should face prosecution as appropriate, \u201cif there is sufficient admissible evidence, and any misappropriated public funds should be fully recovered.\u201d\n\nSERAP maintained that the damning revelations \u201csuggest a grave violation of the public trust, the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and international human rights and anti-corruption standards.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cInvestigating and prosecuting anyone who spent public funds without appropriation and authorisation will send a powerful message that this illegal and unconstitutional practice will not be tolerated under your (President Buhari\u2019s) watch.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cComplying with constitutional requirements and international standards on spending of public funds would ensure effective and efficient management of public resources, and put the country\u2019s wealth and resources to work for the common good of all Nigerians. This in turn would reduce the growing levels of borrowing and public debts.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\n\n\u201cAccording to part 2 of the 2018 annual audited report by the Auditor-General of the Federation, \u20a6880,894,733,084.811 was spent by 367 MDAs without appropriation. 14 MDAs reportedly spent \u20a6162,924,630,539.20 without appropriation. Similarly, 100 MDAs spent \u20a6229,136,261,325.73 on \u2018social benefits\u2019 without appropriation.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 151 MDAs exceeded their 2018 Overhead Appropriation by \u20a6476,625,502,048.87 without any evidence of supplementary appropriation or approved virement to support the extra-budgetary spending. 102 MDAs also reportedly spent \u20a612,208,339,171.01 on subsidies without budgetary provisions. The Auditor-General is concerned that the money may have been misappropriated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdentifying and naming and shaming those who spent public funds without appropriation would improve the chances of success of your government\u2019s oft-repeated commitment to fight corruption and end the impunity of perpetrators. It will also serve the public interest.\n\n\u201cSERAP is seriously concerned about the adverse consequences of unconstitutional and poor management of public resources on the human rights of poor and vulnerable Nigerians, including denying them access to essential public goods and services such as quality healthcare, education, and clean water.\n\n\u201cPublic confidence and accountability in public administration are instrumental to the prevention of corruption and greater efficiency. Transparent and accountable public financial management is a key pillar of good governance, and of vital importance to provide public goods and services to citizens, as well as to create and maintain fair and sustainable economic and social conditions in the country.\n\n\u201cCorruption thrives in contexts that provide opportunities to engage in illicit conduct, widespread motives to take advantage of such opportunities and weak controls.\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to direct Mrs Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning to publish widely the details of MDAs and public officials involved in the unconstitutional spending of public funds.\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to ask the heads of the MDAs involved to explain why they reportedly spent public funds without appropriation, contrary to constitutional and international requirements, and standards of transparency and accountability in the preparation, processes and decisions on their budgets, and to return any money spent without approval to the public treasury.\u201d\n\nThe letter was copied to Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Professor Bolaji Owasanoye, Chairman Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Isaiah Ekanem of the Methodist Church, lamented the sad incident, saying his nephew was full of energy and had vision for a bright future.\n\nThe cleric called on government to post corps members within their geographical zones to avert tragedies.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe major challenge of the NYSC is road accident. Victor Akpan was twenty three years old.\n\n\u201cA prophet, peacemaker and shining star with leadership talents cut short just like that. It calls for prayers at a time like this; as children of God, we submit to God\u2019s will. It is tragic.\n\n\u201cThe only way to overcome this challenge which NYSC has is to restrict posting of corps members to their geographical zones.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Federal Government should arrange for their transportation to their various camps with professional drivers and speed limits.\n\n\u201cThere should be phone number to call in case of reckless drivers because we were told the driver was the cause of the accident.\n\n\u201cGovernment should go a long way to subsidize flight fares\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Evangelist James, uncle of Stella Sylvester Ekiko, shared the family\u2019s agony, but, in a voice laced with emotion, also appealed to the Federal Government to give succor to the bereaved families by giving automatic employment to the siblings of the deceased persons.\n\nA sympathizer, Emem Okon, described the return of the bodies of the young graduates in an aircraft as the height of insensitivity and hypocrisy and prayed God to give the bereaved families and friends the strength to bear the loss.\n\n\u201cWhy did they not put them in an aircraft to the camp? Now their bodies are brought back in an aircraft. Is this not medicine after death? Is this not eye service and hypocrisy of the highest order?\u201d he said.\n\nThe Director General of the NYSC, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, had hurried to Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital, as the news of the death of the young graduates spread, to commiserate with the government and people of the state.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel, who received the DG, expressed sadness.\n\n\u201cI could feel the pains as a father because not after you have finished sponsoring your child from primary through secondary school to university and then on his way to NYSC camp this happened\u201d, the governor said.\n\n\u201cIt is a very sad moment and black Wednesday. Well, we can\u2019t question God when things like this happen, it\u2019s God that knows everything and He\u2019s in control of everything but our heartfelt condolences will always and ever go out to the parents and the families of those corps members.\n\n\u201cOur prayers will always go to these our beloved sons and daughters who have lost their lives.\n\n\u201cI pray may it never happen again; we pray for the families of these young sons and daughters of ours, that God will visit them and God will always be there for them because that\u2019s what will make a difference.\n\n\u201cNo word of man, no sympathy of man can ever fill that gap.\u201d\n\nThe governor thanked the Director General of the NYSC for his prompt reaction to the incident and condolence visit to the state and families of the corps members, describing him as a good shepherd who has demonstrated love and concern over the wellbeing of the corps members.\n\nEmmanuel vowed to clamp down on transport agencies conveying NYSC members at night to long distances, lamenting that such sad occurrence would have been avoided if the transport agency did not embark on the risky journey.\n\nIn his remarks, Ibrahim described the incident as a sad moment for the NYSC community and affected families, praying God to console Akwa Ibom State and the families who lost their children.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is a very sad day for us. I refer to it as black Wednesday. We commenced our Batch \u2018B\u2019 Stream One orientation exercise on the 27th of this month and just, yesterday, we got a call on what happened and the entire NYSC family and the people of the state are completely devastated\u201d, the NYSC boss said.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the NYSC management and corps members, accept our heartfelt condolences\u201d.\n\nSpeaker of the state House of Assembly, Aniekan Bassey, equally expressed sadness over the tragic incident and prayed God to grant the bereaved families the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe leadership and members of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly are deeply saddened and heartbroken by the sad incident.\n\n\u201cI am more pained that most of them were our constituents who had willingly offered to serve the nation.\n\n\u201cI pray that God Almighty will console and comfort the families, the people and government of our dear state and that of Imo State.\u201d\n\nAlso, Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Monday Uko, said it was a rude shock for him to hear about the incident, describing it as a colossal loss.\n\nHe said, \u201cHaving garnered the required knowledge and expertise in their respective areas of specialization, this regrettable occurrence has deprived the state and country of the sterling contributions those heroic but fallen youths would have brought to bear in our continuing efforts at nation building and development.\u201d\n\nUko, whose views were contained in statement, gave the assurance of the wholehearted support of the state government to the bereaved families, the loved ones they have left behind as well as the NYSC family \u201cin this moment of trepidation and beyond.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nIt is no longer in doubt that some hoodlums have adopted beheading as a new form of crime in some parts of Imo State, but what is in doubt and worrisome is why they are engaging in this gory act.\n\nOur correspondent who visited the debris of a hotel burnt down by alleged security operatives at Okporo, Orlu in the penultimate Sunday can authoritatively report why the act was carried out.\n\nWhile the hotel and private residence of the hotelier was razed by the security operatives, a native of the community had his head chopped off and displayed on the road by some evil-minded hoodlums.\n\nOur correspondent gathered from the residents that the victim was paying dearly for allegedly being a whistle blower to the police.\n\nMoreover, the source said that police have invaded their community severally, killing and arresting them and tagging them members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe same reason he added was deduced to why the security operatives stormed the community again and razed down the buildings perceived to belong to the hotelier who police have linked to being a financier of IPOB.\n\nA statement by the police confirmed the claims behind razing of the hotel and home of the hotelier known as Chinonso Uba.\n\nThe statement released by the Imo State Police Public Relation Officer, Michael Abattam, explained that a 15-year-old boy, Emmanuel Nnaji, described as a bandit arrested with a bullet wound after an attack on the police division in the area subsequently led them to the hotel, allegedly used as a hideout by the hoodlums.\n\n\u201cOn interrogation by the command\u2019s tactical teams, the suspect gave a vivid description of a hotel located in Orlu as where they, the bandits, stayed, planned, before they executed their dastardly act on the police stations.\n\n\u201cHe further stated that, the owner of the hotel has been accommodating and assisting them financially. He then volunteered and led security forces to the location of the hotel,\u201d the police claimed.\n\nWhen our correspondent visited the scene, natives of the community were observed to be living in fears, afraid of not being the next victim of beheading.\n\nMost of them accosted seemed to feign ignorance of what has happened or even refused to talk. Some of them who managed to talk only pretended to be strangers to the community. But fortunately, one of them who was a little bit bold to talk to our correspondent admitted that the people were afraid to talk and they are being mindful of anybody seeing them with a stranger .\n\nEven though he did not disclose his name, he said: \u201cNobody will talk to you here, all of them are afraid of being labelled an \u201cOsu imi\u201d (whistleblower). I\u2019m only talking to you because you said you\u2019re a journalist.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to die, most of these people beheaded were as a result of the \u2018Osu imi\u2019 ,that is all I can tell you.\u201d\n\nWhen inquired who were the people behind the dastardly act, he said: \u201cThat I cannot answer you, but are you not an Igbo, if you say some people belong to IPOB, how about those hoodlums among us here that are passionate about the Biafra restoration that may not be a member of IPOB.\n\n\u201cSome of these bad boys take it upon their shoulders to do all sort of things, moreover, they are not happy how police have been killing our people and arresting them, so anybody discovered I believe pay that wicked price, so you don\u2019t need to bother asking anybody about this, I even advise that you should go.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that on June 16, at Orsu council area of the state, a lawmaker from the area, Ekene Ndumele escaped death by whiskers, but his gateman did not as he was beheaded by the hoodlums.\n\nThe same day in the same community, an All Progressives Congress(APC) chieftain, Jonathan Ugochukwu also had his head chopped off.\n\nAlso, a native doctor, Paschal Okeke, as reported at Oru East, Awommama had his head severed from his body this time purportedly by members of ESN who allegedly claimed that the charms prepared for them were impotent.\n\nAlthough, IPOB has denied the claim, contrary to the claims that the group is behind the beheading and attacks on police stations, the Biafran has declared war on any gunmen caught engaging in such act. This was contained in a statement issued last week by the spokesperson of the group, Emma Powerful.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Gainers and Losers of Emefiele\u2019s Reform Agenda in CBN",
          "text": "FINANCE\n\nAlthough, the Governor of the Central of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, opted for a low-key 60th birthday celebration last week, his achievements, especially in his capacity as the CBN helmsman cannot be kept under the carpet. Festus Akanbi examines Emefiele\u2019s robust performance in his seven years\u2019 stint at the apex bank\n\nUntil his emergence as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria on March 6, 2014, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who turned 60 years old last week remained a conservative man, running an equally conservative but hugely successful Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nHis appearance in the media space was measured, so also his positions on issues. However, the former Managing Director and chief executive of Zenith Bank never left anyone in doubt about his competence, nationalist fervour, and professionalism.\n\nThis was why upon his appointment as the new apex bank\u2019s helmsman, the first step he took was to embark on a wide-ranged consultation with his fellow bank\u2019s chief executives, the academic community, which he still has a close affinity with, the organised private sector, and of course, the media.\n\nHis resolve was to make a remarkable difference in the office laced with banana peels because of the tendency of Aso Rock to interfering in the activities of the Central Bank from time to time.\n\nSo, when sometimes in March, he invited this correspondent to his Ajose Adeogun\u2019s office, his question was what do you think can be done differently?\n\nThe discussions ranged from giving the apex bank a human face to ensuring that everyone was carried along. He also gave the assurance that his office would be opened to suggestions as feedbacks.\n\nHowever, seven years down the line, Emefiele can be said to have left an indelible mark on the nation\u2019s financial sector as several policy decisions initiated and implemented by the apex bank under his watch have proved to be the needed economic balm, especially in the period of crises, which has seen Nigeria in and out of economic recession twice.\n\nIt was therefore not a surprise that on June 2, 2019, President Mohammadu Buhari renewed the appointment of Mr. Emefiele, an appointment seen as a cautious choice for a role that will be critical in the period leading to the post-Covid-19 era.\n\nThe Winners: The Banking Industry\n\nHaving run one of the most profitable banks in the country before he was headhunted by President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration, the CBN Governor has been able to demonstrate his firm hold on the banking industry in the past seven years.\n\nIndustry watchers attributed Emefiele\u2019s close monitoring to the current stable outlook in the industry. It is instructive that under his watch, the industry was devoid of crisis in the scale that existed before his tenure and this is why so far, apart from the board and management of Skye Bank Plc, which were sacked, no other commercial banks had any cause to lose its officials on the order of the apex bank.\n\nThe recent clampdown on bureau de change operators, which gave their share of official foreign exchange allocations to banks is another gain for commercial banks.\n\nWhat this singular policy change will do for banks is to increase customers\u2019 traffic. This will in turn trigger more profit-yielding transactions in the banks.\n\nNewly Licensed Banks\n\nIn June 2019, the CBN, under the leadership of Emefiele, licensed three new banks, which included two commercial banks and one non-interest bank, to boost banking operations in Nigeria. The new entrants are Titan Trust Bank Limited; Globus Bank Limited and TAJ Bank Limited, which is a non-interest bank.\n\nThis development has brought the number of commercial banks to 22 and two non-interest banks, namely: Jaiz Bank Plc and Taj Bank.\n\nThe 22 commercial banks are Access Bank Plc, Citibank Nigeria Limited; Ecobank Nigeria Plc; Fidelity Bank Plc; First Bank Nigeria Limited; First City Monument Bank Plc; Globus Bank Limited; Guaranty Trust Bank Plc; Heritage Banking Company Limited; Keystone Bank; Polaris Bank; Providus Bank and Stanbic IBTC Bank Limited; Sterling Bank Plc; Sun Trust Bank Nigeria Limited; Titan Trust Bank Ltd; Union Bank of Nigeria Plc; United Bank for Africa Plc; Unity Bank Plc; Wema Bank Plc and Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nProfessionalism in Banking Industry\n\nObservers believe that by staying out of political drama, Emefiele has been able to set a good example for bank chiefs and the result is a banking industry devoid of scandals.\n\nThe industry is also free from the activities of politically exposed persons.\n\nIndeed, Emefiele has been able to prove himself to be a thoroughbred banker and economist who does not leave official responsibilities to chase shadows, hence the decision of President Buhari to put him forward again after the expiration of his first term, a feat unrivalled since the return of democracy in 1999.\n\nMicrofinance Banks\n\nUnder the supervision of Emefiele, the CBN has continued to revise supervisory and regulatory guidelines for the operations of microfinance banks in the country, a development said to have contributed to the stability in that sector.\n\nThe bank also introduced new capital for operators. According to the latest directive from CBN, the Tier 1 microfinance banks had their capital threshold raised from N100 million to N200million by April 2021, while the threshold for the Tier 2 unit moved from N35million in 2020 to N50 million as of April this year.\n\nFor the state-based Microfinance Banks, the CBN moved their capital from N500 million in April 2020 to N1billion by April 2021.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the changes were made to improve the performance of the Microfinance Bank in the financial industry.\n\nThe Productive Sector\n\nEmefiele\u2019s adopted a protectionist policy in favour of locally produced goods and services.\n\nHis policy was designed to drastically reduce imports and encourage local production and create jobs. At the heart of the policy was the desire to spur the domestic economy, which had been swallowed with an unrestrained taste for foreign goods and enhance production.\n\nRealising the undue pressure over the nation\u2019s external reserves, especially from importers of all manner of goods and services, Emefiele decided to cut off importers of 41 items from official foreign exchange allocation, with the promise to expand the list from time to time.\n\nThis policy also seeks to discourage the dumping of sub-standard goods which were flooding the Nigerian markets. To ensure that a vacuum was not created and to ensure that dealers in the goods barred from CBN fx allocation have other profitable things to do, the CBN came up with the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme, Investors and Exporters Window, Youth Entrepreneur Development Programme (YEPD), Real Sector Support Fund Facility (RSSP) and Accelerated Agriculture Development Scheme (AADS) (this not to mention the N220bn MSMEDF, ACGS, SMECGS, etc.) and importantly, his brand of economic nationalism \u2013 Produce, Add Value and Export (PAVE).\n\nGradually, many Nigerians began to appreciate the importance of the CBN\u2019s action on the 41 banned items. Many entrepreneurs took advantage of this policy to venture into domestic production of the restricted items with remarkable successes and a great positive impact on employment. The dramatic decline in import bills and the increase in domestic production of these items attested to the efficacy of Emefiele\u2019s initiatives.\n\nThe CBN Governor himself attested to these developments. According to the statistics reeled out by the CBN, the Bank\u2019s monthly food import bill from $665.4 million in January 2015 fell to $160.4 million as of October 2018; a cumulative fall of 75.9 percent and an implied savings of over $21 billion on food imports alone over that period. Most evident were the 97.3 percent cumulative reduction in monthly rice import bills, 99.6 percent in fish, 81.3 percent in milk, 63.7% in sugar, and 68.5% in wheat.\n\nAlso, the Investors and Exporters FX (I&E) window was introduced by Emefiele, which allowed investors and exporters to purchase and sell foreign exchange at the prevailing market rate.\n\nThe Investors and Exporters\u2019 Forex Window attracted over $50 billion investments into the country within a spate of three years.\n\nThe Governor is said to have been able to rally commercial banks\u2019 chief executives to support his vision in growing the economy by setting aside five percent of their annual profit to finance agriculture and the real sector to create jobs and wealth.\n\nTalking about his drive to rally around local producers of goods and services, Emefiele was quoted as saying, \u201cThis path of supporting domestication of local production in Nigeria is imperative for us to enable growth that is inclusive and sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to continue to rely on a model that encourages imports of goods and exports of jobs away from Nigeria, as the ramifications will be huge on our economy\u201d.\n\nTo confirm that the CBN under his watch is on the tracks, Emefiele stated, \u201cOur efforts have aided the recovery of the manufacturing sector as reflected in the Purchasing Managers Index which shows that the index on manufacturing activities rose from a low of 42.4 points in May 2020 to 48.7 points in February 2021.\n\n\u201cWhile growth remains fragile, driving further growth of the economy would require that we continue to support more investments that will enable the growth of the manufacturing sector in Nigeria,\u201d the apex bank governor said.\n\nNigerian Farmers\n\nOne can describe the tenure of Emefiele as a season of support to Nigerian farmers.\n\nAs a result of the various support for rice farmers, rice pyramids have mounted in Kebbi State, as rice is now being produced in about 26 states in the federation, making Nigeria almost self-sufficient in rice production. So also, is the bumper harvest that has been recorded in sorghum, maize, millet, cassava, tomatoes, and cotton farmers under the CBN\u2019s Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme.\n\nIn line with its developmental function, which is distinct from its primary mandate of price stability, the CBN had established the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) which was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.\n\nThe programme aimed to create a linkage between anchor companies involved in the processing and smallholder farmers (SHF) of the required key agricultural commodities.\n\nThe thrust of the ABP is the provision of farm inputs in kind and cash to smallholder farmers to boost production of farm commodities which states have a comparative advantage to produce including cereals namely rice, maize, wheat, cotton; roots and tubers namely cassava, potatoes, yam, ginger, tomato, poultry, oil palm, fish, sugarcane among others.\n\nThe CBN governor\u2019s efforts towards food sufficiency especially in rice production have now materialised and currently causing ripples effects in the economy.\n\nToday, there has been a revolution in local rice production, as most of the inactive rice mills across the country have suddenly received life again while the staple has become the favourite in most Nigerian homes, partly because of its affordability and the fact that local rice had been properly cleaned up to eliminate stone particles which had been a turn off for most people.\n\nThe staple can now compete with the imported counterpart.\n\nThe National President, Rice Farmers Association (RIFAN), Alhaji Aminu Goronyo said all farmers\u2019 groups have lauded the pronouncement and committed to ensuring the country achieves food security.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not a new thing at all as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has in the last four years, has not been issuing forex to most of the essential commodities that were being imported into the country.\n\n\u201cFor over four years, rice and other commodities including maize had not enjoyed any support from the CBN to import them into the country. So, this is not a new thing, nevertheless, it is a welcome idea as Nigeria in no distant time will be self-sufficient in all commodities going by this instruction from the president.\u201d\n\nThe Creative Industry\n\nRealising the rising potentials of the creative industry, Emefiele recently unveiled the plan to commence the implementation of the N22 billion Creative industry development scheme.\n\nThe Creative Industry Initiative, he said was aimed at unlocking the creative talents of Nigerian youths and was designed to generate 800,000 jobs in the movie, music, and fashion sectors, and increase the revenue of the industry by $300 million.\n\nThe CBN governor stated that throughout the initiative, over five years, 50 additional cinemas would be developed across the country. This, he said would increase the contribution of the movie industry to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to 3% from the current level of 1%.\n\nThe plan is said to create over 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in the country. Just like the movie industry, the music industry would also be expanding through this initiative, as over the next five years, young Nigerians would be able to capture a significant market share of the $10.7 billion music industry. It would also create over 500,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\nFor instance, the ongoing remodelling of the National Arts Theatre under the \u2018Lagos Creative and Entertainment Centre\u2019 is one such supports. The N21.3 billion remodelling project initiated by the CBN-led Bankers\u2019 Committee will house the fashion, music, movies, and IT hubs. It will boost the creative and IT sectors in the areas of job creation, capacity building, and forex revenue generation.\n\nThe CIFI goal is to support start-ups and existing businesses across these four pillars as well as foster the development of a Nigeria Creative Industries Centre in major cities in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN has, through the CIFI scheme, encouraged banks to play more prominent roles by ensuring that the creative industry not only gets funding but also the right capacity that promotes creativity.\n\nLosers: Board and Management of Skye Bank Plc\n\nOn July 4, 2016, the CBN announced the sack of Skye Bank\u2019s management team and board, when Emefiele blamed their dismissal on Skye Bank\u2019s inability to meet requirements for capital adequacy ratio (CAR) \u2013 a measure of how much capital banks have to protect customers\u2019 deposits.\n\nA bridge bank option was adopted. Today, Skye Bank is now significantly less popular but stable Polaris Bank.\n\nBoard of FBN Holdings\n\nIn the case of First Bank, the banking arm of FBN Holding Plc, analysts described Emefiele\u2019s recent intervention as an attempt to stem the tide of high-handedness, which could have precipitated an unmitigated crisis in the oldest bank.\n\nProving to be a gentleman who knows when to \u2018bark and bite,\u2019 Emefiele stepped into the bank\u2019s crisis when he overruled the decision of the board of the bank to sack the current chief executive, Dr. Sola Adeduntan, without recourse to the apex bank.\n\nEmefiele did not mince words. First Bank\u2019s leaders crossed the line and were made to pay, without hurting the bank\u2019s minority shareholders and 31 million customers. Too big to fail does not mean too big to be flogged.\n\nBureau de change operators\n\nPerhaps, members of the Association of Bureau de Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) should be counting their losses by now having been eliminated from the chain of money market operators with access to official foreign exchange supply.\n\nThe CBN Governor who wielded the hammer two weeks ago blamed some bureau de change operators for unwholesome activities, which allegedly heightened pressure on the available dollar supply with a corresponding crash in the value of the naira. Today, Nigerians who need foreign currencies for their Basic Travel Allowance can access any commercial banks for such transactions, leaving the BDC operators to deal with few customers who approach BDCs to avoid bank\u2019s protocols. The policy shift also left BDC operators to look for their fx supply from other sources, with the attendant stress and low-profit margins.\n\nParallel market operators\n\nAnalysts believe that Emefiele\u2019s pronouncements on BDC operators were bound to affect the operations of parallel marketers of forex. Given the suspicion that some of the BDC operators are the brains behind the boom in the parallel market, the restriction from the official fx market on BDC operators will not only reduce the volume of trade in the black market, it will also force some sponsors of black market activities to go underground.\n\nEmefiele had announced the readiness of the apex bank to investigate the activities of some fx operators involved in arbitrage activities.\n\nSome Microfinance banks\n\nTo ensure strict compliance with the laid down rules, the CBN under Emefiele was compelled to withdraw the licences of some microfinance banks for sundry infractions.\n\nThe list of licensed microfinance banks as of August 19, 2015, was 949 but as of June 30 this year, the list had reduced to 876.\n\nSmugglers and importers of 41 items excluded from CBN List\n\nIt didn\u2019t come as a surprise that a cocktail of reforms introduced into the foreign exchange market is frustrating the activities of smugglers, especially, those bringing in food items into Nigeria.\n\nThe revolution in rice farming, for instance, is creating an unprecedented appetite for locally produced rice, which is found in the local markets in greater quantity, a development that signposts the gradual rejection of smuggled foreign rice in Nigeria.\n\nAlso, the noose tightened on BDC operators is said to be frustrating smugglers and importers of less important items into the country because, under Emefiele, doors of cheap fx have been shut since he insisted the few available foreign exchanges should be reserved for ventures. which guarantees employment opportunities and wealth to Nigerians.\n\nGiven the laudable achievements of the CBN under the leadership of Mr. Emefiele, one can say that the apex bank is on the right track, especially with its timely interventions in critical sectors of the economy.\n\nAs Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo puts it, \u201cThe CBN Governor came into position at a very crucial time where the economy has experienced economic recession at two different times.\n\n\u201cAs stated in his inaugural address, the CBN Governor has provided significant support for the Nigerian economy through the use of intervention funds to boost economic growth.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Women ENTERPRENEURS\n\nFOLASHADE OGUNWUSI-FADAIRO\n\nPrincess Folashade Ogunwusi-Fadairo is the chief executive officer of Wuraolaby4lar Couture. An amazon, she is a big-time fashion designer and business tycoon, who delved into fashion as a hobby, which later turned into a cash cow. During her university days, Ogunwusi-Fadairo, who is the senior sister of Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, was one of the best-dressed ladies on campus and to date, dresses impeccably well. As the CEO of Wuraolaby4lar couture, Ogunwusi-Fadairo has an eye for complete fashion and styles; what to wear and how to rock it. She can look at anyone and suggest the right combination of colours, styles, and befitting fabrics, designs, styles, patterns, embellishments, and accessories. Wuraolaby4lar Couture serves as wardrobe managers to the cr\u00e8me-de-la- cr\u00e8me of the society; showing the world how to rock African styles with appealing touches of ancient and international standards. In this Interview with Oyinlola Sale, Ogunwusi-Fadairo tells a story of how her hobby turned into a money-making venture and gives further insights into her business and fashion industry generally\n\nYour journey into the fashion industry started as a hobby, which gave birth to Wuraolaby4lar Couture. Now tell us what we don\u2019t know about your breakthrough in the fashion industry?\n\nMy journey into the fashion world started from growing up as the first girl of the family. I was always trying all my mum\u2019s stuff, for example putting on her big sunglasses, her wigs, etc. Well, fashion to me is an inborn thing, and it\u2019s all about creativity and creativity is the mother of invention, that is, creating a new style. So to me in the fashion industry what I see as my breakthrough is when I started designing my fabric.\n\nIn addition to my breakthrough in the fashion world is the establishment of my brand name which is Wuraolaby4lar Couture. This brand was named after my late mum, who was my great mentor.\n\nI have looked at some of your designs and they are very distinct, what inspires your creativity?\n\nI will say colours inspire my creativity; I am a lover of beautiful things and I am attracted to nature like beautiful flowers that are colorful and this boosts my creativity anytime because I love to play around colours. More so with great help from my darling husband Prince Babajide Fadairo, who grew up in Los Angeles, the world\u2019s home of fashion, also helped me immensely with putting stuff together to achieve my unique designs.\n\nThe fashion industry has become a global phenomenon, where foreigners adore our local attires, how did this industry achieve that height?\n\nForeigners adore our local attires because they are beautiful and unique in their way, black naturally is beautiful. And we can achieve the height by believing in the works of our hands and by appreciating our locally made attires. The Adire and Ankara fabrics are so loved by African Americans that want to identify with their backgrounds. I remember there was a music video of Beyonc\u00e9 and Janet Jackson featuring people wearing and displaying the beauty of Ankara. This is a great achievement so far.\n\nAs an expert in the field of fashion, what are the important factors one must consider before venturing into the fashion business?\n\nLet me start by saying Rome was not built in a day, you have to do your homework. Create your niche, your design, determine your market level, and have a business plan.\n\nWhat are the challenges you have faced so far in running Wuraolaby4lar Couture?\n\nThere is competition everywhere, you cannot avoid it. Nigerians not believing in locally made products is also a challenge. Everyone wants to wear designers like Prada, Gucci, Tom Ford, etc. Wuraolaby4lar couture is working hard to get to greater heights.\n\nThe fashion industry is churning out a lot of creative designers, what is your view about this growth?\n\nI feel that creative designers should be encouraged. Nobody should discourage them no matter what.\n\nThe Nigerian creative economy is so vast now, which has led to a major driver of socio-economic and cultural sustainable change all over the world. And Nigerians are not left out too, once you have a vision, you will create and then implement, which will lead to churning out increment.\n\nWould you say being a princess of a prominent kingdom in Yorubaland has heightened your clientele and opportunities in the fashion industry? Can you tell us more about your background?\n\nI was born into the family of Prince Oluropo Ogunwusi and late Madam Wuraola Ogunwusi, we are seven children and I am the first girl in the family.\n\nI started my primary education with Subuola Memorial Nursery and Primary School in Ibadan and ended it at Seventh Day Adventist Primary School Agodi Ibadan and proceeded to Isabatudeen Girls Grammar School, Orita Basorun Ibadan, then to College of Education, Ilesa and finished it up at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile Ife with BA.Ed.\n\nThen, I did my National Youth Corp Service with 21st Century Communication at Ikosi Ketu Lagos, and started my career in teaching before I proceeded to the Nigerian Port Authority to start a career as a PIDA staff later to a shipping company, Prime Marketing Shipping Company in Apapa, Lagos. I later did a course on landscaping and horticulture before I started my fashion career, which am doing to date.\n\nNow, talking about how being a princess from a kingdom in Yorubaland has heightened my clientele and opportunities in the fashion industry, I think I will give it a percentage of 30 percent because I believe in my work and I don\u2019t attach the throne to my work; they are two different entities.\n\nHow did you manage to finance this business in the early days?\n\nI was able to do this during my early days because I learnt to save and support myself with other little businesses I love doing.\n\nSo what makes Wuraolaby4lar Couture stand out amid a competitive market?\n\nOur constant dedication, and designs, and ability to deliver on time.\n\nWhat were some of your biggest fears when you ventured into the fashion business?\n\nMy biggest fear was the fear of the unknown. I always wondered if I will succeed but God surprised me.\n\nFashion designers have complained about the textile industry in Nigeria. What can the government do to revive the textile industry in Nigeria?\n\nTo revive the textile industry the government has to encourage the importation of industrial machines to make textiles. Just look at China; they have gone so far, there is nothing they cannot make or design when it comes to textiles. I remember so many years ago when China town came to Nigeria with their cheap laces and kinds of stuff, they were located in Ikoyi, before they moved to Ojota, nobody wanted to buy their products then because people see them as cheap, but I was buying from them then and reselling to people. But today, they are so big now. Our locally made Adire print should be encouraged too by the government to create employment opportunities.\n\nTell us about your greatest achievement in this journey, are there any awards-worthy to be celebrated?\n\nMy greatest achievement is seeing my designs out there in America, UK, and Canada. So far, I have received more than five awards and I\u2019m still receiving more.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "BBNaija S6: Who Leaves the House Tonight?",
          "text": "Vanessa Obioha writes that amidst the drama that unfolded in the BBNaija house during the week, one or two housemates are likely to take a bow tonight\n\nThe first eviction live show witnessed no eviction due to the inability of the housemates to predict who the wild cards were. But not tonight! At least, one of the nominated housemates will exit the show tonight.\n\nMaria and Pere were given a nomination edge over their housemates for concealing their identity, to the chagrin of some of the housemates. The pair were the only ones that participated in the nomination process on Monday evening. Asked to nominate four housemates each, the eventual nominees placed on the eviction list were JayPaul, Beatrice, Niyi, WhiteMoney and Yerins.\n\nHowever, Boma, who won the Head of House title for the week, used his veto power to save JayPaul and replaced him with Yousef.\n\nOf the nominated housemates, WhiteMoney seems to be a favourite among viewers. Known for his funny antics, the comedian and businessman from Enugu State is popular on social media. He\u2019s been turned to memes and GIFs. Moreso, his fan base includes Nollywood stars such as Yul Edochie who has openly pledged to support him.\n\nAccording to social media analytics carried out by ID Africa, WhiteMoney was in the list of the top five most talked about housemates for the first week and continued to the second week, particularly after the nominations were announced and of course, after he initiated the fashion show that got fans talking. Given his popularity on social media, he is unlikely to be evicted tonight.\n\nDespite being the most misunderstood housemate in the house, Beatrice fans are not cowered. They are steadily drumming support for her to stay till the end of the show. She is likely to survive the eviction, especially after her altercation with Liquorose on Friday, although voting closed on Thursday night. The duo had a verbal war after Liquorose told other housemates that she (Beatrice) and Angel stayed up at night to gossip about them. Liquorose, who seemed to be awake at the time, said she heard some \u2018punchlines\u2019 in their discussion.\n\nIn her diary session, Angel gave a breakdown of how everything happened. According to her, she left the red room to sleep in the blue room because it was cooler. On her way there, Maria asked who she was sleeping with, slyly pushing her to sleep with Sammie, her rumoured love interest.\n\nAngel and Sammie seemed to have struck a liking to each other from the first night as they were seen cuddling in bed together. This gave the housemates the impression that they were to be an item.\n\nRelationships are inevitable in the Big Brother Naija house. Previous seasons have seen housemates building relationships that lasted beyond the show. For instance, Gedoni and Khafi who participated in the \u2018Pepper Dem\u2019 edition are happily married and expecting a child. The winner of that season, Mercy Eke also had a romantic affair with one of the male housemates Ike and both had their reality TV show \u2018Mercy and Ike\u2019 based on their relationship. These relationships gave birth to the term \u2018ship\u2019 and its accompaniments. When two housemates of opposite sex show affection for each other, they are considered \u2018a sailing ship\u2019. However, when the relationship hits a rock, they are regarded as \u2018a sinking ship\u2019\n\nIn the \u2018Shine Ya Eye\u2019 season, some ships have been glimpsed. They include Angel and Sammie, Saga and Nini, Emmanuel and Liquorose, Jackie B and Boma and a fleeting triangle between Maria, Pere and Beatrice.\n\nBut Angel is not feeling excited as others over her relationship with Sammie. As far as she is concerned, she is not romantically linked with anyone in the house.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just catching cruise\u201d, she had often said.\n\nDue to her free-spirited mien, her name pops up in discussions. For instance, during a chat with Yousef and Pere, Saga disclosed that Angel showered with everybody, although he is yet to have a shower with her. He said she had offered to but he declined. Niyi on the other hand claimed that Angel made advances at her in the shower.\n\nHer situation with Sammie was one of the talking points in her discussion with Beatrice that Thursday night but segued to other relationships in the house, including Beatrice revelation that Pere seems to have an interest in her but she is not having it, to which Angel responded that Pere was probably using her to make Maria jealous.\n\nAngel also disclosed that they talked about Liquorose and Emmanuel. According to her, Emmanuel was a flirt and not good enough for Liquorose.\n\nBy Friday morning, Angel noticed the cold reception from others. A confrontation would later occur between her and Liquorose over her misinterpretation of the late-night chat she had with Beatrice. Angel felt Liquorose should have confronted them when she heard her name instead of telling everyone that they (Angel and Beatrice) were gossiping about them. Defending her stance, Beatrice and Liquorose exchanged insults.\n\nIn the heat of the discussion, Jackie B and Maria had their own bout of verbal war. Maria felt it was insensitive of Jackie B to find the altercation funny. Jackie B wouldn\u2019t have any of it. Already offended by Maria\u2019s acerbic comments about her attire at the fashion show, she let out a stream of insults and the house became chaotic again.\n\nBefore the gossip drama unfolded, Nini and Tega had their own confrontation. Tega had pulled a seat under Nini\u2019s feet which the other claimed was disrespectful.\n\nHowever, by the end of the day, most of the warring parties shoved their differences under the rug.\n\nAs the eviction takes place tonight, Yerins the 27-year-old medical doctor and Yousef will likely take a bow, although Yousef, the gentle and handsome teacher may have an edge over Yerins as his name occasionally pops up on social media.\n\nWhile the odds are stacked against Yerins, he may surprisi ngly survive the eviction. After all, in Big Brother Naija house, anything can happen.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The funding was made possible by a partnership between the financier, Sterling Bank, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe startup claims to operate as an intersection of edtech, fintech, and the future of work. It specialises in software and mobile application development, website creation, UX design, and product marketing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 2018 by Chika Nwobi (CEO), Decagon trains and connects engineers to work remotely with local and international companies.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Nwobi said that tech giants like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have established engineering offices in Nigeria.

Students who choose this option are expected to repay approximately $6,000 over three years.\n\nThis allows the company to offer a Pay-After-Learning plan that includes laptops, housing, Internet, meal allowance, and a stipend. According to the company, no upfront payment is required.\n\nDecagon claims to be the first in Nigeria to provide students with such merit-based loan financing.

          "title": "MainOne\u2019s new data centre could usher in exciting connectivity age in Ghana",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has gradually become home to exciting innovations. Startups, raising capital in billions, are birthing disruptive models across sectors, and global tech giants are extending their tentacles to the untapped markets in the continent.\n\nSeamless connectivity is essential to help businesses and individuals reap the rewards of the disruptions happening across the continent. Still, the lack of the required infrastructure to effect this has caused slower growth in Africa.\n\nAs of March 2021, Africa had a 37.42% average Internet penetration with wide gaps between juggernauts like Kenya at 85% and smaller countries like Eritrea at 6.9%.\n\nA map showing Internet penetration rates in Africa. Hover your mouse on each country map to see the numbers\n\nIn the early 2000s, Africa\u2019s policymakers made significant strides to tackle this issue, but the game changed in 2009 with the launch of the MainOne cable on the West African coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by CEO Funke Opeke\u2019s passion for connecting Africa to the Internet, MainOne\u2019s feat initiated a boost to Internet speeds that seemingly aided the proliferation of startups and tech-enabled businesses in Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s most developed tech ecosystems.\n\nRecognising another apparent gap, the company subsequently launched a series of data centre facilities, through its subsidiary, MDXi, in Lagos, Nigeria, to support the myriad of businesses popping up in the nation\u2019s commercial capital.\n\nMainOne is not resting on its laurels, as MDXi announced its data centre facility expansion to Appolonia City in Greater Accra, Ghana.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, data centres are facilities that house computer systems and other components like telecommunications and storage systems.\n\nLike fibre optic cables, and base transceiver stations (telecom masts), data centres are a critical part of the global Internet infrastructure.\n\nThese centres process large amounts of data and host websites, manage emails, and even help instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram run effectively. Data centres are grouped in tiers, with tier 1 being the simplest and Tier 4 being the most advanced.\n\nA 2020 researchandmarkets.com report titled Data Center Market in Africa \u2013 Industry Outlook and Forecast 2021-2026 reveals that Africa has invested up to $2 billion in data centres and will reach $5 billion by 2026.\n\nThe report argues that the rise in data traffic caused by COVID-19 will further increase African businesses and governments\u2019 demand for data centres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, few African countries are cloud-ready, considering constraints from a lack of inland and submarine fibre and power availability.\n\nResearchandmarkets.com states that economic heavyweights like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia will witness significant growth in data centre activities. Still, several countries with those constraints could miss out on this growth.\n\nSo what\u2019s the attraction in Ghana?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainOne\u2019s data centre launch in Ghana\n\nMainOne\u2019s past initiatives suggest launching its data centre in Ghana as a natural progression that aligns with its connectivity ambitions.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched its second data centre \u2014 the first outside Nigeria \u2014 in Ivory Coast, one of West Africa\u2019s major economic hubs. Through this move, MainOne solidified its intention to oil the engine of Ivory Coast\u2019s digital economy.\n\nIn an exhaustive chat with Techpoint Africa in July 2020, Funke Opeke hinted that MainOne would be expanding its data centre footprint to Shagamu, Ogun State \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s second most industrialised state \u2014 and other West African countries.\n\nTrue to her words, MainOne has seemingly set its sights on Ghana.\n\nBacked by a large population, a vast economy, and increasing digitisation, Nigeria has grabbed the major headlines for West Africa\u2019s tech-related activities.\n\nHowever, past events also suggest that African tech companies planning to expand nearly always have Ghana in their sights. Recent examples include Nigeria\u2019s GIG Logistics and Cars45, and Kenya\u2019s Quickbus.\n\nWhy?\n\nGhana is West Africa\u2019s second-largest economy, and about 57% (17.6 million) of its 31 million population are below the age of 25, while over 14 million out of 18 million adults are literate. The country is home to startups like mPharma, Jetstream, Bace Group, OZ\u00c9 , and Nvoicia.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched its 5th Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab in Accra, Ghana and in 2021, Twitter surprisingly chose Ghana to launch its first African office.\n\nBesides, the Ghanaian government recently started introducing forward-thinking digital projects.\n\nFollowing the pandemic\u2019s onset, in July 2020, it began building a digital template for elections using the African Union\u2019s proprietary technology \u2014 the PanaBIOS online platform.Seven months later, in February 2021, it piloted a regulatory innovation sandbox for financial services companies.\n\nAs recently as June 2021, it commenced West Africa\u2019s first digital census.\n\nSuch digital activity requires fast and reliable Internet access, which is only possible with the presence of basic and advanced telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Ghana\u2019s Internet space look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Speedtest\u2019s global Internet index, Ghana currently has the fastest fixed broadband speeds in Africa at 51.93 Mbps, ahead of South Africa (47 Mbps) and Egypt (42 Mbps).\n\nThe Speedtest Global Index is a service owned by Ookla, a US-based Internet analytics company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana has the fastest broadband speeds in West Africa. It, alongside Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal, lead the region by a wide margin.\n\nHowever, just 0.3% of Ghana\u2019s population has access to fixed broadband services, hinting at low adoption.\n\nFor mobile Internet, the numbers are slightly different. Internet World Stats reveals that, in December 2020, Ghana had a 46.5% mobile Internet penetration rate. While this is higher than the continental average of 37.42%, it falls behind 27 other African countries.\n\nAs of January 2021, Ghana reportedly has 15.7 million registered mobile Internet users. It, however, only has a mobile Internet speed of 13.8 Mbps.\n\nWhile Internet penetration has been increasing, Ghana\u2019s 79th and 132nd positions globally for fixed broadband and mobile Internet show there\u2019s significant room for improvement. Like other African countries, infrastructure remains a major challenge.\n\nHow Africa has improved its Internet speeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glut of Internet cables in Africa. Source:\n\nDespite immense growth in recent years, several Africans still don\u2019t have access to the Internet. The continent has the slowest Internet speeds and the highest costs relative to income. This gap has presented opportunities and challenges.\n\nSince MainOne\u2019s cable launch, other submarine cables have landed in Africa to give it a combined capacity of 100 terabits, and upcoming initiatives from Google and Facebook could add 280 terabits. Still, cables are only one layer as several other challenges plague African countries.\n\nCountries like Nigeria and Kenya have taken it a step further by improving the usage of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).\n\nPer the Internet Exchange Society, websites load slowly in Africa since several of them have servers outside the continent. Encouragingly, local IXPs resolve this problem by lowering the cost and latency of accessing content from foreign websites.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2020, Nigeria and Kenya have localised 70% of Internet traffic through local IXPs, which has helped them save a combined $46 million. Other African countries have seemingly not witnessed as much success.\n\nCould MainOne push Ghana even further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nSince Ghana decentralised its telecom sector in the late 90s, MTN, Vodafone, and Airtel have provided healthy competition to drive Internet adoption.\n\nHowever, MainOne plans to take this a step further. The newly launched data centre will offer open access connectivity options to Ghana\u2019s leading telecom operators and direct access to the MainOne cable and other submarine cable systems.\n\nIt also offers access to Internet exchanges like the GIX (Ghana), IXPN (Nigeria), LINX (London), DE-CIX (Frankfurt/Lisbon), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Internet Exchange (CIVIX), and the West Africa Internet Exchange (WAF-IX).\n\n\u201cThis creates shorter routes for internet traffic with direct access to content providers, which enables better internet resilience, reduced latency, and improved customer experience for internet users in Ghana,\u201d MainOne says.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ghana could well be on its way to localising Internet traffic, boosting its speeds, and saving millions of dollars in the process.\n\nEven more business benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting Internet speeds affects individuals and businesses in Ghana, but the MDXi\u2019s other features shoot its business value up a notch.\n\nIt reportedly features private data centre suites, precision cooling, and enterprise-grade 24\u00d77 multi-level security and video surveillance.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nMVX\u2019s $1.3 million seed round\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Ghana\n\nRevio\u2019s $1 million seed round\n\nMVX raises $1.3 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMVX team. Source TechCrunch\n\nNigerian digital freight company, MVX, has raised a $1.3 million seed round to scale its operations, hire staff, and improve its technology.\n\nWho participated in the round? Kepple Africa Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa Ventures, and Oak Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy MVX? Per Techcrunch, Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO and Founder of MVX, was fascinated by the lack of an online marketplace for vessels while working in the maritime industry in 2016.\n\nHowever, he couldn\u2019t launch because it was challenging to find the right partner and team. But, in 2019, he established MVX with Tobi Amusan (CTO) after raising a $100,000 pre-seed round.\n\nBecause its business model centred around offering a support vessel booking platform that linked vessel chartering requests, MVX was previously referred to as MVXchange.\n\nHowever, this changed in 2020 because of the uncertainty of oil prices and the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe freight company launched MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform that helped cargo owners find deals on moving containers. And in April 2021, it launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? The two products are now rolled into MVX. Also, the startup plans to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online.\n\nThe startup claims it has expanded beyond Nigeria and that merchants from the West African country and Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Dignited\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has launched Tingg in Ghana. Tingg is a digital payments network that allows businesses and their customers to accept and make payments easily.\n\nThis announcement is coming after Cellulant was granted a Payment Services Provider (PSP) licence by the Central Bank of Ghana (CBG).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that Cellulant is now one of the PSPs supported by the Bank of Ghana to provide digital payment solutions throughout the country.\n\nAlso, the PSP licence allows Cellulant to aggregate merchant services and payments for banks, institutions, and the general public, process financial services, acquire merchants, and build PoS systems.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. The licence permits establishing a third-party payment gateway, and a marketplace for fully regulated financial service providers. It also allows merchant acquisition and aggregation, the printing and display of EMV cards, and the limited usage of closed-loop virtual cards.\n\nWhy the licence? The licence is required under the Payment Services Act 2019, which requires any fintech or digital payments company to be licenced by the Bank of Ghana before operating in the nation.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the requirements.\n\nAccording to Cellulant, Tingg helps businesses to digitise their payments using different options.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will enable consumers\u2019 merchants to pay for products and services using regionally appropriate payment options.\n\nRevio raises over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African billing startup, Revio, has raised more than $1 million in a seed round. International venture development firm, The Delta, led the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Brent Maropis (CEO) and Louis Buys (Co-founder), Revio is dedicated to assisting startups, particularly those in the Software as a Service (SaaS) space, get the most out of their billing subscriptions.\n\nAccording to Buys, the company improves client loyalty and makes it easy to avoid unsuccessful payments and customer loss. Essentially, it enables organisations to communicate with customers in real-time through the intelligent use of machine learning and analytics.\n\nRevio claims it supports all currencies and integrates with the African payments startup, Flutterwave, to allow its SaaS clients to sell their products to all African customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Though it\u2019s currently focused on the South African market, Revio plans to expand to East Africa in 2022.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFlutterwave to drive US expansion as it appoints Silicon Valley veteran as head of US growth.

          "text": "Lagos to divert traffic on Apapa-Oshodi Expressway for 8 weeks\n\nThe Lagos State Government has announced the diversion of traffic on Apapa-Oshodi Expressway for repair work on the Airport Flyover Bridge by the Federal Ministry of Works from August 9 to October 3, 2021.\n\nThe structure of the airport flyover bridge at Toyota on the Oshodi-Isolo axis was affected by the inferno that occurred in January 2021, on the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, due to a petrol tanker explosion.\n\nThis disclosure is contained in a statement signed by the Lagos State commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde.\n\nOladeinde explained that the Oshodi-bound lane would be barred from vehicular movement from midnight on 9th August 2021 and reopened partially on the midnight of 14th August 2021 for the first phase of repairs.\n\nRead also: FG approves $11.17bn rail project linking coastal cities\n\nHe stated that the second phase will commence immediately for a duration of seven weeks to hasten the rehabilitation works, stressing that motorists will be diverted from the main carriageway to the service lane of the Oshodi bound lane for the first five days.\n\nOladeinde also revealed that traffic heading towards Oshodi-bound lane will be diverted to the service lane at Ladipo, while those heading to Mile 2 will be diverted to the Airport Road, adding that two lanes on both Oshodi and Mile 2 roads will equally be open to vehicular movement to ease traffic.\n\nHe appealed to motorists to drive with caution and forbearance as this will help ameliorate the traffic gridlock that may arise during the rehabilitation period, affirming that the safety of Lagosians is a top priority of the Lagos State Government.\n\nTraffic diversion at Marina National Theatre in the week ahead\n\nThe Lagos State Government has announced plans to divert traffic on the National Theatre and Marina axis for a period of 7 months with effect from Monday, August 9, 2021.\n\nThe diversion which is for the continuation of works on the Blue Line rail project is part of the current administration\u2019s mandate to ensure the safety of motorists and construction personnel during the course of the construction of the project.\n\nThis disclosure is contained in a statement made by the Lagos State commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, who said the road diversion is for a duration of 221 days.\n\nAccording to NAN, Oladeinde said that the Traffic Management Plan (T.M.P) would address the impact of the construction work on traffic and subsequently eliminate traffic-related issues.\n\nThe commissioner explained that the construction would commence on the right-hand side of the road for a duration of 116 days while the left-hand side would take 182 days.\n\nOladeinde stated that some of the works would be done simultaneously as some aspects of the construction would require such attention.\n\nHe said, \u201cMotorists would be diverted to the descending ramp of Ebute-Ero to link Marina ring road through a diversion point. Alternately, traffic will also be diverted to Chapel Street along Apongbon to access Broad Street.\n\n\u201cTraffic signs and temporary barriers will be mounted along the affected axis to guide motorists on movement during the course of the construction. The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) will be on ground to ensure safety of motorists and efficient access to their destinations.\u2019\u2019\n\nNBS economy data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\nMonday 9th August, 2021: Daily Energy Generated and sent out (Q2 2021),\n\nTuesday 10th August, 2021: Annual abstract of statistics, 2018 and 2019.\n\nOil prices record biggest weekly decline since March\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister on Monday said the country will respond promptly to any threat against its security as the United States, Israel, and Britain blamed her for an attack on an Israeli-managed tanker off the coast of Oman.\n\nThe Middle East state-held oil firms, including Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), are considering selling more assets to investors to monetize their stakes and attract foreign investors as oil prices rise.\n\nOil prices extended the previous session gains on Friday but headed for the biggest weekly decline since March as travel restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant are raising concerns about fuel demand. Brent had a weekly decline of -7.35%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to dip on worries that travel restrictions to curb the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 will derail economic gains.\n\nCurrency Market\n\nThere was a sense of calm in the currency market especially at the BDC market, the Naira strengthened at the BDC market as the banks seemed to have complied with the CBN stance to sell FX to retailers.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the domestic currency dipped slightly by -0.01% on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis to close at N411.50/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.\n\nAgainst the US dollar at the BDC it closed at US$1/N508 appreciated by +3.24%, against the British pound it also appreciated by +1.40% to close at \u00a31/N705, and against the Euro by +0.17% to close at \u20ac1/N602.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.50 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.10.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nFor a major part of trading last week, system liquidity was elevated pushing money market rates low and trading in single digits.\n\nHowever, at the close of the session on Friday, funding rates rose significantly. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 20.00% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 20.50% indicating a W-o-W rise of +166.67% for OBB and +164.52% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury Bills Market\n\nThe treasury bill market was broadly bullish for most of the trading session last week, as we saw some buying across all tenors during the week.\n\nAt the close of the market last week, average benchmark yields for T-bills fell by -4.65% to 5.63%, OMO bills declined up by -10.53% W-o-W to close at 7.78%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell marginally by 0.12% to close at 8.22%. We expect activity in the new week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and eurobond market\n\nThe bulls dominated the FGN bond market as positive sentiment was seen across the board. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.06% for the week which fell W-o-W by -2.10%.\n\nThe Covid-19 induced risk-off sentiment caused yields in the Eurobond market to inch up last week and selling was seen across the board with minimal volumes traded.\n\nOn the domestic space, the Federal Government of Nigeria appointed transaction advisers for a Eurobond issue. The Eurobonds to be issued, are to raise funds for the New External Borrowing of N2.343 trillion (about USD6.2 billion) provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act to part finance the Deficit.\n\nHowever, market sentiment is expected to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a positive note with some cherry picking and bargain hunting. The NGXASI closed the week with a growth of +0.68%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N137.38bn, year-to-date return moderated to -3.63%, while the market capitalization settled at N20.22 trillion.\n\nThe volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange last week dipped by -56.66% and -56.41% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was broadly negative last week as the NGX-30 was the highest loser for the week with -0.11% while NGX-IND, NGX Consumer Goods, NGX Banking, NGX Oil & Gas and NGX Insurance declined by -0.21%, -0.48%, -0.58%, -0.61% and -1.65% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed negative with 23 gainers led by CUTIX and REGALINS as against 36 losers led by NEIMETH and AIICO.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect to see further bargain hunting around the half-year earnings season as companies continue to release their results and impressive earnings reports should spur some interest. However, other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.",

          "text": "The re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and his subsequent detention at the Department of State Service (DSS) has further pitted the Federal Government against Kanu\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe manner of his arrest, which many have described as \u201ckidnapping\u201d from Kenya, and the refusal of government to proceed with his trial, may have riled many of his supporters.\n\nOn July 26, 2021 when Kanu was to appear before the court, the DSS refused to produce him, which angered many.\n\n\u201cIf there are any serious allegations against Nnamdi Kanu, the regime will hurry to try him and convict him. Since there is no serious case against him, the regime has chosen to play \u2018hide and seek\u2019, while desperately searching for a political solution. The allegation of treasonable felony seems frivolous as we all know that,\u201d Martin Onovo, a former presidential candidate, said.\n\nTo press for the unconditional release of their leader, IPOB has since announced a sit-at-home in all the states in the South-East for Monday, August 9, 2023.\n\nRead Also: Kanu\u2019s case and \u2018tsetse fly on the scrotum\u2019 allegory\n\nBut the agitators have been advised to seek other avenues of resolving the impasse as shutting down economic and social activities in the geo-political zone may boomerang on the people in many ways than one.\n\nThey have also been warned that toeing that route may aggravate the standoff between Abuja and the secessionist agitators, which may lead to use of force by security agencies. So, to avoid unnecessary loss of lives, the group has been urged to tread with caution.\n\nRead Also: Sit-at-home order cripples activities in South-east\n\nRecently, Samuel Ikome Sako, president of the internationally unrecognised proto-state of Federal Republic of Ambazonia, which has been fighting with the Cameroonian authorities for declaring its independence, has been touring Nigeria with his team, meeting and deliberating with the Nigerian government on the safety of his people who are across some states in Nigeria as refugees.\n\nIn one of those meetings, the president noted that the leadership of the country carved out of southern Cameroon, was in Nigeria to plead for the authorities to see his people as helpless refugees, hence, demand for valid documentation and harassment would add to their suffering as many at home are dying in the hands of Cameroonian soldiers.\n\nThe rationale for him is, \u201cIf my people all die, whose liberation are we fighting then, and there cannot be a country with a people\u201d.\n\nSame principles apply to the several agitations across Nigeria today. From Biafra to Oduduwa, the safety of lives and property within the areas of the agitators, matters most.\n\nRead Also: Yoruba nation agitators defy police order, stage protest in Lagos\n\nOf course, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which has not hidden its demand from the Federal Government, is set to clash with the government for re-arresting Nnamdi Kanu, its leader.\n\nWhile Nigerians await retaliatory actions from IPOB, which has been brimming hot since the incarceration of its leader, many observers think that any aggressive action from IPOB may result in bloodbath in the region as witnessed recently with the growing insecurity in the region.\n\nAlready, IPOB is set to enforce its sit-at-home order across the eastern states from August 9, 2021, an order many think will further stifle the economy of the region, which is recovering from the impact of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, and growing insecurity in recent times that has seen many businesses exit the region.\n\nAccording to Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, African governments on several occasions have used force to quell agitations in their countries and Nigeria is not different.\n\n\u201cIt has happened in Southern Sudan, Eritrea, and the same is happening in Ethiopia now, Southern Cameroon and Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that in recent times, Nigeria has stepped up actions against agitations, especially IPOB and now Oduduwa Nation agitators, for a singular reason that no voice of discord should be heard even when the conditions of coexisting as a country are not favourable.\n\n\u201cIn every agitation, people will die for challenging the status quo or for seeking their rights, but it is usually the innocent and poor people that are sacrificed when weapons clash in such areas,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example with the Tigray war, he noted that the Ethiopian government would do everything to ensure that the region remains in the East African country despite the huge casualties.\n\nOnikoyi advised IPOB to tread with caution and bear the interest of the people they are fighting for in mind, as ordering businesses to shut down and people to sit at home will only worsen their woes.\n\nIn his views Chigbu Onumah, a lawyer and activist based in Onitsha, Anambra State, noted that more young people have lost their lives to the Biafran cause since the emergence of IPOB and that more are going to die considering the inhuman approach of the present administration to agitations.\n\n\u201cI will advise IPOB to suspend the sit-at-home order for now and look for other ways to demand for the release of their leader because our people are the ones that will die in the hands of the Nigerian soldiers again. I have seen soldiers open fire on Biafra agitators, many lives were lost and they will not relent in killing more when ordered to do so again. But it is a shame that the government has refused to address the reasons for the agitations and rather use force to suppress people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe thinks that a better way to go is by changing their strategy of engaging the governors, senators and prominent Igbo sons, dialoguing more and taking the matter to the United Nations as it is clear the safety of the Igbo Nation is not guaranteed in Nigeria, especially by the present government.\n\nIn same vein, Valentine Nkwazema, real estate developer and hotel owner in Owerri, noted that most people across the eastern states live on self-help as government presence has always been lacking in the region, so closing down their source of livelihood for a day or two may not draw the needed sympathy.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government has always frowned at the Biafra cause, and with the look of things, it will go any length to suppress the agitation and that is why we want IPOB to use other means that will not expose the vulnerable people to more hardship to fight the Biafra cause,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGovernors, senators and prominent people from the region are not talking because of fear of intimidation by the government; their children are also not here, so IPOB should bear our safety in mind because our governors are more interested in the national cake than lending support to the Biafra cause\u201d.\n\nHowever, Onikoyi insisted that when violence fails, dialogue will win, hence advising the agitators for Biafra, Oduduwa, Ambazonia Republic and even in Spain, to keep the dialogue on without violence, pressing harder at the UN and other international bodies to make their cases.\n\nBut will the Nigerian agitators listen as the government fails to address reasons for the agitations?\n\nA prominent South-Easterner has also urged against being confrontational with the current government, as according to him, \u201cit has proven that it can wipe out the entire people without batting eyelids.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur people must be careful in the strategies they adopt in the pursuit of self-determination. Shutting down the entire East is further punishing your people. The Federal Government actors are not there. By so doing, you are destroying your economy. I think we should not give the government the opportunity to inflict more harm on us,\u201d the observer said on condition of anonymity.\n\nHe urged the agitators to liaise with the Ohanaeze Ndigbo and other groups that have shown to be concerned about the plight of the Igbo Nation, for a harmonised approach to seek the political and economic emancipation of the people in the zone.\n\nHe also noted that with the campaign being mounted, not just by some leaders and groups in the South East, but many others across South-South, South-West and the Middle Belt, the struggle is no longer that of IPOB alone.\n\nHe also alluded to the recent letter by the Nigerian Indigenous National Alliance for Self-determination (NINAS) calling on the western countries, including the United States, to stop selling arms to the Nigerian government as part of the efforts showing that the campaign for self-determination is not just a matter for IPOB.\n\nRecall that NINAS\u2019 letter alleged that previous arms sold to the Buhari-led administration with borrowed funds have found their way into the hands of herdsmen, Boko Haram, ISIS, and other terrorists that are currently terrorising the Indigenous People of the South and Middle Belt.\n\nThe group also urged western countries to impose heavy sanctions on the Nigerian government for undermining democracy and continuously abusing human rights.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by the communications manager to NINAS, Maxwell Adeleye.\n\nThe CFM signatories who wrote the petition to the US government and European countries, according to the statement, included a renowned Historian, Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, former President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo; respected Varsity Don, Yusuf Turaki, Secretary-General of NINAS, Tony Nnadi; Pioneer Commissioner for Education in Osun State and National Chairman of Ilana Omo Oodua, Professor Wale Adeniran, among others.\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cThe arms being sold to the Nigerian Government with funds borrowed from your territory are now being used to kill, oppress, harass, intimidate and strangulate harmless protesters and defenseless people of the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria who are exercising their rights to self-determination and peaceful assembly.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram terrorists, Fulani herdsmen and bandits are now maiming, harassing and killing our people on the roads and in their farmlands with same arms and ammunition bought from your countries with impunity.\n\n\u201cToday, peaceful protest is an aberration in Nigeria. Opposition voices are now being arrested and caged behind the bar for demanding good governance and their inalienable right to self-determination.\u201d\n\nThe group further said: \u201cFreedom of speech is now an essential commodity in Nigeria. The leadership of Nigeria is now censoring the media to prevent free speech to alert the world to the ingoing genocide. Social Media is now under threat in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFulani herdsmen have taken over our farm lands, which is rapidly resulting in food scarcity which is responsible for the current booming reign of hunger and starvation in our land especially given the government induced over 42 percent poverty level.\n\n\u201cWe, as a people, consider the current government of Nigeria a danger to democracy, and we demand, on behalf of our people, that an axe of sanction should be dangled on the government for undermining democracy, and for contravening the fundamental human rights of the people of the South and Middle Belt.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to you, in the interest of peace-loving people of the South and Middle Belt of Nigeria to halt further sale of arms to the Nigerian Government until the country surrenders the sovereignty of the people back to them.\u201d",
          "summary": "The re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and his subsequent detention at the Department of State Service (DSS) has further pitted the Federal Government against Kanu\u2019s supporters.\nThe allegation of treasonable felony seems frivolous as we all know that,\u201d Martin Onovo, a former presidential candidate, said.\nTo press for the unconditional release of their leader, IPOB has since announced a sit-at-home in all the states in the South-East for Monday, August 9, 2023.\nI have seen soldiers open fire on Biafra agitators, many lives were lost and they will not relent in killing more when ordered to do so again.\nBut will the Nigerian agitators listen as the government fails to address reasons for the agitations?",

          "text": "Insurance is a critical component of living and doing business. The aftermath of the EndSARS protest in October 2020, insecurity in parts of the country that no longer allow farmers to go for harvest, and impacts of climate change on businesses, particularly Micro, Small & Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) have reignited the importance of insurance as protection option for the sector.\n\nThe need for insurance protection experts say has become very critical given the role of MSMEs as major actors in the economic development of any nation particularly job creation.\n\nAccording to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) National Survey of 2017, there are around 41.5 million SMEs in Nigeria, and they represent businesses with less than N100 million in annual turnovers and have less than 300 employees.\n\nAccording to experts, not recognizing this important sector of the economy by allowing them exposed to various kinds of avoidable risks that confront them on day to day basis is a disservice to the general well being of the economy.\n\nAt a stakeholders workshop organized by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) for sensitization on insurance for MSMES held in Lagos, the Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu said MSMEs account for nearly 50percent of the nation\u2019s GDP and contributes 80 percent of the nation\u2019s employment.\n\nRead also: CIIN continues drive for greater insurance culture\n\nSanwo-Olu who was represented by the commissioner for Finance, Lagos state, Rabiu Olowo noted that the state government cannot afford to ignore the challenges confronting MSMEs and threatening their survival.\n\n\u201cThat is why we describe our MSMEs as very resilient, if you can do business in Nigeria and thrive, there is nowhere you cannot thrive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have launched so many initiatives and strategies and are still being implemented towards providing an enabling environment for MSMEs to not only thrive but to succeed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, as a guaranteed approach to protecting small businesses against unforeseen losses and circumstances that may threaten their operations securing insurance cover must be encouraged.\n\nSanwo-Olu, therefore, tasked insurers to create special products for MSMEs, that is affordable and free from technicalities for easy assimilation with the assurance of settlement of claims.\n\nHowever, he advised insurance companies to ensure that insurance policies designed for MSMEs must meet their needs and also address the peculiarities of MSMEs.\n\n\u201cThere should be specially designed products that will meet their category, income, operations and processes such must be affordable and free of technicalities so that it can be easily understood with assurance of settlement of claims,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI enjoin all MSMEs in Lagos State to embrace insurance as a safety net against losses that might be suffered as a result of unforeseen circumstances,\u201d he urged.\n\nSunday Thomas, commissioner for Insurance speaking at the event assured that the commission is committed to its mandate of providing diligent oversight to the insurance sector towards ensuring prompt settlement of genuine claims when an insured event occurs.\n\n\u201cI dare say that the MSMEs sector is too important to be neglected as it is key to the economic development of the nation and thus, must be guided and protected against failure.\n\n\u201cThe encouraging responses validate that the products meet a critical need also that the appetite for players in the MSMEs sector to succeed sustainably is high,\u201d he said.\n\nMuftau Oyegunle, president of, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria said that the MSMEs are fundamental at core areas of its operation that it needs to expand.\n\nYetunde Ilori, director-general of the Nigerian Insurance Association urged the MSMEs to link their businesses with insurance protection. \u201cWhatever you cannot afford to lose should be insured.\u201d\n\nAbdulrasheed Babalola speaking on the benefits of Insurance to MSMEs informed the attendees that insurance protection offers financial protection, boosting production and facilitating access to finance.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nA construction engineer, Engr. Aneru Izuagbe, Managing Director of Amineru Enterprises Limited and his wife Amina are farmers who are calling for support and collaboration to boost their small scale food packaging business.\n\nThe whole idea of the business started when Amina, a Secretarial administration graduate who has been involved in several kinds of businesses before she got married to Aneru discussed with her husband sometime around 2012 that she would stop eating pounded yam and instead take wheat.\n\nThat was how she started buying wheat and milling the delicacy to eat and as time goes by she was able to convince the husband to start taking wheat as a meal as well. It was at this point she was able to mill enough wheat and people bought from her.\n\nWhen they started with just wheat, the response was so impressive and they saw it as a lucrative business. They then applied to NAFDAC for registration for the production of wheat after the inspection of the premises which was one of their buildings.\n\nIt was the NAFDAC officials who advised on the need to use the back flat of the building as a factory. They took the samples to their laboratory at Onitsha, took the test to their headquarters in Lagos and eventually, they were given NAFDAC certification.\n\nIt was initially certification for wheat, plantain and then groundnut and pepper soup and they all have the NAFDAC number. They have also gone into garri- cassava farming, with the acquisition of a large farm land from where they get their cassava raw materials. They also have a farm for plantain which they hope to harvest by next year.\n\nSpeaking with the NIGERIAN OBSERVER in their factory in Benin City, Engr. Aneru and the wife who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Business said there are great potentials in food consumables because people eat them every day, adding that all they have to ensure is that they have good products and good packaging.\n\n\u201cWe have attended various seminars and trainings on packaging and quality control which have assisted us to come out with the packages we are using now. At the same time we are already up grading this to the type that is transparent for people to see the products that are inside.\n\n\n\nIn the words of Engr. Aneru who is a University of Benin trained Engineer, they have acquired several other certifications such as from the US food and drugs administration. \u201cThis is the US version of NAFDAC. Their consultants in Nigeria came to the factory, took samples and looked at our setup and we passed their test and they gave us their certification.\n\n\u201cThis means that our products can enter the United States market unhindered and we are also registered with the Nigeria Export Promotion Council which regulates export activities within Nigeria. We are also members of Edo Shippers association where Sir Bibowei Braie is our vice president in matters of shipping, import and export business.\n\n\u201cWe are also members of the Nigeria \u2013 German chambers of commerce. The Edo Exporters clusters and we are finalizing our registration with Benin Chambers of Commerce and Industry BENCCIMA.\n\nAccording to him, they are doing all these to create a way for their products to go very wide and create a market, but the challenge he noted has been the productive capacity which is still limited, especially within these last two years with the arrival of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur operations were actually hampered. Before now all those containers you see there are always filled up because we stock them during the season. Plantain has gone off season now, maybe in another one or two month\u2019s time they will begin to come\n\n\u201cDuring that season, we peel, we dry and we stock them in the containers so that we are able to produce all year round. But these last two months production was really low because when plantain came out it became expensive.\n\n\u201cPeople did not go to the farm enough to be able to have enough and to get it was difficult and for us to produce, we stock it at a high cost. It used to be N600 when we started. Last year it was N1000 and now it is N1, 200 because the packaging cost has increased and the raw materials, costs of fueling, diesel have also increased.\n\nHe however, noted that because of the passion for the business and knowing that they will be able to get there with a little encouragement they are very optimistic.\n\nWhile commending the Vice President of the Shippers Council, Sir B. Braie as one of their major supporter and mentor, he disclosed that he was instrumental for their membership of Edo Shippers Association.\n\n\u201cThe Shippers Council were here a couple of weeks ago to find out how we were doing and their coming gave us the encouragement that we really need. We are looking ahead of being like the Dangote\u2019s flour.\n\n\u201cWe know our competitors in the market and we try as much as possible to associate with those that will help us to be above board, he added.\n\nThe Amineru Enterprises Limited started with a small savings but along the line they have been approaching finance bodies, but because of the interest rates of banks they could not access any facility from them.\n\nThe bank of Agriculture and bank of Industry have visited the factory, but their terms are unfriendly. They are also close to the Edo State government, they have attended almost all the trade fairs, Alaghodaro and they are members of Edojobs, an agency of the state government.\n\nThey have attended several government sponsored seminars and the first lady of Edo State, Mrs. Betsy Obaseki who is from the Bank of Industry has seen the products in various seminars and she has called the Edo state manager to attend to us.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have all been here, but their conditions are still very high, we have tried to hire a consultant, Edijala and Co to help source for funds but at the end of the day the conditions are not favorable.\n\n\u201cWhere we had a breakthrough was when NIRSAL micro finance bank was created by the Central bank and a friend of ours who knew about this called us in 2018, and then we were in the village during the Christmas.\n\n\u201cWe had to rush back to Benin and we applied for the programme and luckily we got intervention from NIRSAL last year and we were able to purchase this generator, the drier and other cassava equipment.\n\n\u201cThe intervention was at five percent interest with four years repayment period and we are servicing it right now. Seventy percent of that intervention was invested on equipment, and thirty percent is given to us to do all other things and it is from there they take their insurance, management fee and what we have we use to run our consumables and raw materials for the season.\n\n\u201cWe have the equipment now, but what we actually need now is the support to get the raw materials. Like this packaging cost about N2.5m to get the kind of packaging we want to go into to get ten thousand copies.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to do half of that and the printing is ongoing now, but definitely we would need to bring out the balance to be able to take delivery at the middle of August this year. I can guarantee the product because people like it and they are looking forward to have it.\n\n\u201cLike today we are supplying JARRA and Anambra super markets. The market is there. These are how far we have been able to access support from financial institutions and we are looking for other ways that we can get grants, stress free loans at very low interest.\n\n\u201cThe market guarantees that we would be able to service such loans because we are a small scale business. But with the loans from Banks with interest rates of about twenty to twenty two percent, there is no way we can meet up. Those kinds of supports are good for big firms or factories that have attained very high status. We are trying to upscale, therefore commercial banks are out of it,\u201d he added.\n\nHe further disclosed that the vision of the Business is to make the products available in the next shop, to be available outside the shores of Nigeria and to ensure that if a customer goes to any open market, any major super market they would be able to find the products there.\n\nHe assured that the quality will be maintained because every day they are striving to improve on the quality, saying that before they do any batch it is taken to the University of Benin for Laboratory analysis.\n\n\u201cWe are working towards having the Lab in-house here in the factory because for every test conducted we pay N20, 000 for every batch. Even at that, we are not sure until it stays on the shelve for a year without losing its quality. For you to be sure it will not lose quality you have to be sure of the moisture content.\n\n\u201cWe just do not package blindly like that, because we have a standard which we do not want to come down from. But with N500, 000 we can have our own in- house laboratory.\n\nOn the vision of the business, he said: \u201cWe are looking at getting to the level where Amineru unripe plantain flour, Amineru garri and Amineru beans flour is available. You can send your son to go to the road side store to get any of our products, that is where we want to be and we are working gradually towards that level.\n\nWhen at the peak of production, the factory produces about two hundred kg every day and the investment on equipment and the building so far is about seventy million.\n\nBut, the support the factory require to expand to get the products to every house hold is about N2.5m for the packaging, and for the purchase of a garri processing equipment that will be used from peeling to finished products in one straight line without going through hard labour will cost about five thousand dollars. Therefore with another N20m the factory will be ready and set to go.\u201d\n\nIn his words, though they have not officially received any request for partnership, he however noted that they are open to anyone or organization coming to invest to help expand the business so that they can share the proceeds depending on the investment levels.\n\nHe pointed out that this is one of the ways the business can be expanded, it can become a public liability company, not necessarily a family business. But at the moment it is only the family that has invested in the business.\n\nWhile calling on anyone interested in putting in their share capital to expand the business, Engr. Aneru and the wife enthused, \u201cwe are open to such collaboration, either in terms of cash, in terms of equipment or any initiative; we are very open to ensure Amineru brand expands nationally and internationally.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has finalized plans for a partnership with OZE, an international digital business firm, to boost trade and entrepreneurship development in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a parley with partners from OZE and other stakeholders in Benin City, the Managing Director of Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO), Mr. Kelvin Uwaibi, reassured that the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led government remains committed to providing an enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\n\nSome stakeholders at the meeting include representatives from the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the state, including the Edo State Skills Development Agency (Edojobs); Ministry of Finance; ESIPO and the Ministry of Wealth Creation, Cooperatives and Employment.\n\nThe meeting was also a brainstorming session to map out strategies to ensure the success of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and other businesses in the state.\n\nAccording to Uwaibi, \u201cIt was observed that the rate of default in facilities supported by OZE to MSMEs is minimal. There was 97 percent rate of these businesses actually paying back their facilities.\n\n\u201cWe want MSMEs in the state to improve on how to keep records of activities in their businesses, as this will benefit their business.\n\n\u201cOZE will be our private partner in our MSMEs clinics. We will need them to work with us to create more opportunities for MSMEs in Edo to access facilities.

          "title": "Nebolisa Arah @ 70 \u2013 A Life of Integrity",
          "text": "By Emma Esinnah\n\nIn my nearly 17 years spent in Fidelity Bank, I had the unique privilege of working directly with the first two CEOs of the bank: the founding CEO, Mr. Nebolisa Arah (1988 to 2003), and his successor, Mr. Reginald Ihejiahi (2004 to 2013). The two, between them, served the bank for 25 years, out of its 33years of existence, and four CEOs to date.\n\nNot just within Fidelity only, but in the Nigerian banking industry, there is an acknowledgement that Mr. Nebolisa Arah within his 15 and half years in the saddle, laid the foundation of integrity and professionalism, upon which Mr. Ihejiahi, in the subsequent 10 years , built a bold and visible institution that Fidelity is today.\n\nI worked as special assistant to both CEOs, while doubling as head of marketing communication division, before I went to regional banking towards the twilight of my stay in the bank. Being close to them, I came to the conclusion that Integrity is not an adjective that describes a noun. It is a verb \u2013 a doing word; a life that is lived daily. And it is a self-sacrificing and costly life. But it is one worth living. Ultimately.\n\nToday, my focus is on Mr. Nebolisa Arah, who turns 70 on this 8th day of August 2021. This milestone in his life affords one an opportunity to talk about him from the standpoint of one who worked with him for five and half years and have remained close with him for the past 23-years. You must concede to me that I know a thing or two about the man that the rest of mankind don\u2019t.\n\nYes, many people who know Mr Arah admire him as a man of integrity. But not many people know at what cost that reputation has been achieved. In this piece, I will give some insights into what it could cost to remain on the straight and narrow way, especially when you have an opportunity to call the shots, with only few, if any, being in a position to question you. And this not to humuor or canonize Mr. Arah, but to encourage those who are so minded that a of uprightness is still possible in the market place, though it come at a cost.\n\nSacrifice of personal comfort for the sake of the institution: Corporate Nigeria is filled with people who preach skim and drink full cream. They talk about cost control measures which deny the staff everything, including, sometimes, work tools. Meanwhile, company is funding their lavish lifestyle. Not Mr Arah. At some time that the bank\u2019s numbers were not looking good, Mr Arah began to take only economy class tickets on all local flights. On one occasion, he was to travel to Abuja with another senior staff. That one brought two business class tickets for both of them. He gave me Mr. Arah\u2019s to deliver to him.\n\nWhen I got to Mr. Arah, he took the ticket, saw that it was business class. He asked me how much it was. Of course, the fare was on the ticket stub, so he could see it clearly. But I told him. He asked me the fare for economy class, I told him. He knew, anyway. Then a new dimension was introduced to the discussion. He asked if I saw the last quarter result of the bank.\n\nI answered in the affirmative. He asked, \u201cwas it the best we could do\u201d. I answered, \u201c no, sir\u201d. He said to me: \u201cgo and tell Mr\u2026., if it was his own money, would he pay three times for a one hour flight to Abuja, when his business is not doing well\u201d. He continued, \u201cEmmanuel, look at it. I am not saying people should not take a business class. We are all entitled to it. But when our income is lean, we cannot afford to live fat\u201d. Long and short is that we still got him an economy ticket and applied for a refund on the business class ticket.\n\nA life that preaches: Mr. Arah never liked to handle office money. On the rare occasions that he took a cash advance for a trip, he would do the retirement before getting to the office. On getting to the office, he would hand it over, with whatever change he brought back, even before entering his office. He did not need to preach about discipline in handling office money.\n\nFamily members cannot be your contractors: Mr Arah\u2019s close relations never worked in Fidelity and none did a contract job for the bank, while he was there. An incident happened around December, 2001. The then head of corporate services, Mr. Dele Adedeji, also a very disciplined and God-fearing man, had awarded the delivery of year-end staff gifts (including rice, fresh chicken, tomatoes, etc). There was a competitive bid and the woman won it. Mr. Arah was not aware. But one morning, as he arrived for work, he invited me into his office. He asked, without any niceties, \u201cEmmanuel, you guys awarded the delivery of Essenco (short for essential commodities, as we used to call the items) to my sister-in-law? Well, everybody is going to learn the hard way.\n\nPlease, call her now to come and take away the items, and know payment must be made to her\u201d. Though I was not part of the process that awarded the job, I mustered the courage to ask him \u201cincluding the chicken, sir? \u201d . He answered, Yes. \u201cNext time, you people won\u2019t do it\u201d.\n\nIndeed, if the people that gave the job thought he would not find out, they probably forgot that any amount beyond a certain threshold must be signed off by the MD. Anyway, that was it. Needless to say how much loss the woman incurred. But the lesson was clear. \u201cNo relation of mine does any job here\u201d. I make bold to say one of his brothers, Peter, was one of the best furniture makers in Lagos at the time.\n\nHe made the ones in Mr. Arah\u2019s home. But Mr. Arah never allowed him to do any job for the bank. Peter only worked for Fidelity when Mr Arah had left the bank and didn\u2019t even know Peter got the job. What happened was that in 2004 , when Mr. Arah had left, we needed someone to give a facelift to the MD\u2019s reception area. All the quotes we got were too high. I told the then new MD, Mr Ihejiahi about Peter. Peter was invited. For one third of what others were quoting, he delivered a marvelous job.\n\nAnother relation, Ernest, was employed in Fidelity, after Arah had left. Mr. Arah didn\u2019t even know Ernest applied for the job.\n\nHe is not avaricious: Mr. Arah does not live to impress others. Arah was the CEO of Fidelity Bank for 15 and half years. By the time he left office in December, 2003, he was still living in a rented house. He only began to build his own house in April, 2004!\n\nTruly a self-sacrificing life: When I joined the bank in June , 1998, Mr. Arah\u2019s two official cars were a Peugeot 504 Station Wagon and a Honda Legend. When the 504 was fully depreciated, it was replaced with a Honda CRV. And the Legend was replaced by a BMW X5, which was bought second hand. The car had done 5,600kilometres in Nigeria before it was bought for a bank MD. Who else would take that, but Mr. Arah? At that time, GMs in other banks were already driving \u201d proper\u201d 4Litre engine SUVs.\n\nUnknown to many, Mr. Arah retired from Fidelity a poor man, after 15 and half years as a CEO!\n\nIn life, it is good if people acknowledge your goodness. But whether people do or not, God does. And He is a rewarder of they that diligently seek Him. Writing in the Bible, David made a remarkable statement \u201conce I was young, now I am old. I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging bread\u201d. God did not forget Nebolisa Arah and his sacrifice for a greater Fidelity. In addition, many people in the banking industry also know about his integrity. So, when in 2009 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) took over some banks for poor governance and management, and needed people of integrity, Mr Arah\u2019s name topped the list of those for the rescue operation. So, five and half years after retirement from Fidelity, Nebolisa Arah was appointed MD of Afribank just acquired by the CBN. And a few weeks after, he was in addition, appointed by the Federal Government a Member of the Governing Board of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He has since retired from those offices, but has also got more and more appointments.\n\nMr. Arah\u2019s exemplary life is appreciated by his staff and colleagues. As he turns 70 today, the 8th of August, 2021, we all rejoice with his family. Of course, being who he is, he has discouraged his family and friends from organizing a birthday party. Instead, the occasion is being used to publicly present his memoir called Becoming By Grace, which is the story of his time in the banking industry and journey through life.\n\nMr. Arah, may the nation have more people like you. And may you live long and healthy.\n\nEMMA ESINNAH\n\nformer Deputy General Manager and Regional Bank Head, Fidelity Bank Plc",
          "summary": "Today, my focus is on Mr. Nebolisa Arah, who turns 70 on this 8th day of August 2021.\nYes, many people who know Mr Arah admire him as a man of integrity.\nNot Mr Arah.\nWhat happened was that in 2004 , when Mr. Arah had left, we needed someone to give a facelift to the MD\u2019s reception area.\nEMMA ESINNAHformer Deputy General Manager and Regional Bank Head, Fidelity Bank Plc",

I gave it on a Sunday, my wife was not even aware until she heard my testimony. It was only the Church accountant that knew as a privilege of his office when he saw he volume of money that came in.\n\n\u201cHe said wow! I told him to keep quiet, I didn\u2019t do it for you but for God. Don\u2019t mind all these people that criticise preachers. Ask them how many of them have people in school on scholarship. They will always criticise men of God buying jets. If I buy a jet today, I am over qualified\n\n\u201cI have given countless times. Do you know the number of people on Oyedepo\u2019s scholarship. Be ready to love God but be ready for the envy of people.

They did well in these Covid times to pull it off as smoothly as they did, and then the platform at the back of the room was filled with cameramen and photographers.\n\n\u201cWhen he first walked onto the stage, you felt very sorry for him, he looked like a very lonely and sad figure. When he did start talking he was so upset, so choked and very emotional, he could hardly get his words out.\n\nIn a video seen, at some point while the forward was shedding tears as he gave his speech, everybody in the room were on their feet as they gave the star an echoing applause and a standing ovation.\n\nMessi wept for long before he could continue delivering his farewell speech to Barcelona.\n\nIt was a moment to purely let out emotions both for the parting football star, Barcelona fans and football spectators generally.",

          "text": "Since President Muhammadu Buhari (retd) assumed office on May 29, 2015, his administration has allotted N5.081 trillion for defense, including N4.669 trillion for the Federal Ministry of Defense from 2016 to present and $1 billion (N412 billion) for the acquisition of military equipment.\n\nBetween Buhari\u2019s inauguration in May 2015 and July 2021, the Boko Haram insurgency and attacks by herders and bandits claimed the lives of 11,420 civilians and security personnel.\n\nA manual tally by our journalists and the Nigeria Security Tracker, an initiative of the Council on Foreign Relations, an American think tank, yielded the total for the killings. The BBC, SBM Intelligence, and Amnesty International also provided statistics.\n\nMeanwhile, based on the 2016 Appropriation Act available on the website of the Budget Office of the Federation, a total of N443bn was allocated to the defence ministry, consisting of N312.2bn for recurrent expenditure and N130.8bn for capital expenditure.\n\nIn 2017, N483bn was budgeted for the ministry, including N330.4bn for recurrent expenditure and N138.6bn for capital expenditure.\n\nIn 2018, N576.3bn was allocated to the ministry, comprising N418.6bn for recurrent expenditure and N157.7bn for capital expenditure.\n\nThe defence ministry was expected to get N585.9bn in 2019, including N430.8bn for recurrent expenditure and N159.1bn for capital expenditure.\n\nIn 2020, N899.9bn was budgeted for the ministry, comprising N784bn for recurrent expenditure and N115.8bn for capital expenditure.\n\nIn 2021, N966.4bn was allocated to the ministry, including N838.5bn for recurrent expenditure and N127.8bn for capital expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, the recently signed 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Act allocated to the ministry a total of N714.5bn. The breakdown listed the Defence Headquarters (N35.8bn), Nigerian Army (N106.4bn), Nigerian Navy (N90.9bn), Nigerian Air Force (N426.6bn), and Defence Space Administration (N54.6bn).\n\nThe total recurrent expenditure budgeted for the ministry from 2016 to date is N3.11tn, while the capital expenditure amounts to N830.11bn.\n\nHowever, the corresponding Budget Implementation Reports for 2016-2020, showed that a total of N575.9bn had been released for capital projects and programmes in the Ministry of Defence, representing 81.9 per cent of the total capital allocation for the five-year period.\n\nFor 2016, N97.2bn (74.3 per cent) was released for capital projects and operations in the ministry. In 2017, N117.6bn (84.4 per cent) of the ministry\u2019s capital budget was released.\n\nDuring the year 2018, N132.7bn (84.1 per cent) was released for the ministry\u2019s capital projects and programmes. For 2019, the ministry received N106.8bn (67 per cent) of its allocation, while N121.3bn (104.7 per cent) was released for 2020.\n\nThe Budget Office has yet to release the Budget Implementation Report for 2021.\n\nWith the N575.9bn released to the defence ministry for capital projects (2016-2020 period) and the $1bn (412bn) released for the purchase of arms, the total defence spending on military equipment, including hardware and fighter jets is approximately N987.6bn. This figure is expected to increase to over N1tn by the time the Budget Implementation Report for 2021 is released.\n\nMore than N1tn spent on weapons, aircraft, others\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari, on April 4, 2018, approved the sum of $1bn for military equipment, following a meeting with security chiefs at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThen Minister of Defence, Brig Gen Mansur Dan-Ali, who spoke to State House correspondents after the meeting, said, \u201cOf recent, our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, gave approval for the purchase of more equipment for the military, worth $1bn.\u201d\n\nSunday PUNCH reported in April that the Ministry of Defence had purchased equipment for the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy and the Defence Intelligence Agency worth $99.5m (N37.9bn), out of the $1bn approved by the President.\n\nIn 2018, Buhari told the National Assembly that he had ordered the payment of $496m to the United States Government for the purchase of 12 Tucano aircraft ahead of legislative approval to withdraw the $1bn fund from the Excess Crude Account.\n\nHowever, in March, the $1bn arms fund was engulfed in controversy when the National Security Adviser, Maj Gen Babagana Monguno (retd), alleged that the $1bn meant to purchase arms to tackle the insurgency had gone missing.\n\nThis came barely a month after the resignation and replacement of the service chiefs, including a former Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Abayomi Olonisakin (retd); former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd); former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas (retd.); and former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar (retd).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now. I believe Mr President will investigate where the money went,\u201d Monguno said.\n\nThough the NSA recanted moments later, Nigerians were not deterred from calling for an investigation into how the $1bn arms fund was spent.\n\nSimilarly, the House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on the Need to Review the Purchase, Use and Control of Arms, Ammunition and Related Hardware by Military, Paramilitary and Other Law Enforcement Agencies in Nigeria vowed to investigate the \u201cmissing\u201d arms and ammunition.\n\nSome retired Army generals, who spoke to PUNCH in separate interviews, called for transparency in military spending.\n\nA former Chairman of the South-East Security Committee, Major General Obi Umahi (retd), in an interview with our correspondent, called for a national security emergency that could effectively tackle the security situation, saying war was too important to be left to military generals.\n\nUmahi said, \u201cIssues of security should not be left to generals alone. It should go beyond general-ship. Are votes allocated to the armed forces not subject to the audit? We no longer run a closed military system. It doesn\u2019t work anywhere else in the world. Security budget is open to scrutiny.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we are still in a very tight security situation. We all know that the security situation is still very poor and that is not to say the armed forces are not doing their level best, but it\u2019s just that there may be a need for a total revisiting of the strategy.\n\n\u201cSecurity issues should involve the entire nation. It is no longer an affair that should be left to the security agencies. I have said before that there should be a national security emergency, where a body is set up involving all the stakeholders, and everybody can make suggestions.\u201d\n\nAccording to the retired general, the Federal Government has shown that it cannot see the whole gamut of the security situation.\n\nHe added, \u201cIt requires help, and security is for all of us, so we should all be partakers.\u201d\n\nAsked to assess the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s handling of insecurity, Umahi noted that Buhari needed to expand his security information network.\n\n\u201cEvery leader acts based on the information at his disposal. That is why I made the suggestion earlier that there should be an expansion of his sources of direct information. When there is a national security emergency, then there will be a wide range of opinions he will get from various parts of the country to help him address the security situation in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a former military governor of the Old Western State and former Minister of Police Affairs, Major General David Jemibewon (retd), decried the number of casualties recorded by the military at the hands of insurgents, bandits and other criminals.\n\nTwenty military officers lost their lives in three months after three crashes involving Nigerian Air Force jets.\n\nThe NAF spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, on March 31, said an Alpha-Jet aircraft involved in the anti-terror war against Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province lost radar contact in Borno State.\n\nTwo officers were on board the missing jet, which was later declared crashed and the whereabouts of the two airmen unknown to date.\n\nDecrying the rising insecurity in the country, Jemibewon told Sunday PUNCH, \u201cIt\u2019s frightening to the extent that people get scared now to even travel to their villages. I think it has a great effect on many issues\u2014travelling, production, and so on.\u201d\n\nAsked if military casualties had any effect on the morale of other troops, he said, \u201cOf course, it would! When troops go out and they lose a member, it affects morale, and where the good effect of training comes out is how they absorb the effect of the casualty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any family; when one loses a member of the family, however irresponsible he is, one feels touched, particularly given the circumstances under which he was lost. Though death is death, when it is from a sickness, you can sort of understand. But when it is in an accident, because of the tragedy and suddenness of the situation, it is more painful.\n\n\u201cPersonally, one doesn\u2019t feel happy with some of the things one reads and if they are true, I think we need to do something to curtail the effect it has on people who have faced great tragedy. I am not sure that anybody with my background can be happy with the situation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the retired general, something urgently needs to be done to reduce the amount of killings in the country. He urged the Federal Government to look into the allegations made by Monguno.\n\n\u201cI think those who are in control are in the best position to know whether there is a need for enquiry or not. But then, for people like us who are outside the circle of authority, we can only make proper comments along those lines, if we actually have facts leading to the statement that we are trying to examine.\n\n\u201cWhat is the evidence that this money was actually given out? For what purpose was it given out? What result were we expecting, if it has been properly applied? At the end of the exercise, did we get the result we expected? How was the money spent?\n\n\u201cIf you have spent something based on a calculation you have made and you don\u2019t get the result you want, then that\u2019s a failure, in my view. These are the things I would need to know. And as for those actually making allegations that the money was not appropriately appropriated, there may be a need to ask them questions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted on the telephone, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.), was in the best position to talk on the matter.\n\n\u201cSince we have a Minister of Defence, who is open to talk, I would suggest you ask him about this,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, when contacted, the Special Assistant to the Minister of Defence on Media and Publicity, Mohammad Abdulkadri referred our correspondent to the Defence Headquarters for comment.\n\nThe Director, Defence Information, Major General Benjamin Sawyerr, did not pick our correspondent\u2019s call and was yet to reply the text message sent to his line as of the time of filing this report.\n\nBuhari rode to power on the promise of solving Nigeria\u2019s security challenges, economic issues and corruption problem.\n\nHowever, a tally by Sunday PUNCH shows that at least 11, 420 Nigerians including security personnel and civilians have been killed by bandits, terrorists and herdsmen in the last six years.\n\nThe figure on the killings was obtained by a manual tally by one of our correspondents and the Nigeria Security Tracker, a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, an American think tank.\n\nStatistics were also sourced from the BBC, SBM Intelligence and Amnesty International.\n\nThe report on killings, however, does not include assailants and persons killed by security personnel. The figure also does not include persons killed on a large scale by security personnel like the 236 Internally Displaced Persons mistakenly killed by the Nigerian Air Force killed in Rann, Borno State in January 2017 or the 300 members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria who were allegedly murdered in 2015.\n\nAlso excluded from the report are persons killed by robbers, cultists or lost to communal clashes.\n\nVictims of electoral violence are also not included in this report, indicating that the total figure on killings under Buhari could be double if all murders across the country are added.\n\nBetween May 29, 2015, when Buhari took over, and December 31, 2015, at least 2, 791 persons were murdered by Boko Haram, herdsmen and \u2018unknown gunmen.\u2019\n\nIn 2016, the figure dropped to 1, 460 based on a renewed offensive by the military which led to the killing of over 400 assailants and the rescue of over 500 hostages.\n\nThe casualty figure of unarmed civilians continued to drop into 2017 where 900 persons were killed by mainly Boko Haram but the shape of insecurity began to change gradually due to killings by herdsmen.\n\nBy 2018, the killings by herdsmen increased while the Boko Haram attacks dropped relatively. The activities of bandits in Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna caused the casualty figure to rise to 2, 419.\n\nNEWS DIRECT observed that the killings by herdsmen continued while banditry became a more common feature in media reports in Nigeria. About 2, 371 were killed by bandits, terrorists and violent herdsmen in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, about 3, 176 persons were killed mostly by bandits and herdsmen. In 2021, however, abductions became more common than killings as over 1,000 students were kidnapped between January and July. As of July 31, 2021, no fewer than 1,094 persons had been murdered by bandits and terrorists, bringing the total to 11, 420.\n\nThe states mostly affected by the insecurity include: Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, Benue, Borno, Adamawa, Sokoto, Katsina, Taraba and Plateau.",
          "summary": "The defence ministry was expected to get N585.9bn in 2019, including N430.8bn for recurrent expenditure and N159.1bn for capital expenditure.\nAdditionally, the recently signed 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Act allocated to the ministry a total of N714.5bn.\nThe breakdown listed the Defence Headquarters (N35.8bn), Nigerian Army (N106.4bn), Nigerian Navy (N90.9bn), Nigerian Air Force (N426.6bn), and Defence Space Administration (N54.6bn).\nThe report on killings, however, does not include assailants and persons killed by security personnel.\nAlso excluded from the report are persons killed by robbers, cultists or lost to communal clashes.",

          "text": "Former Military Head of State Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB, has come under scrutiny for his reason for annulling the June 12 presidential election.\n\nJare Ajayi, a spokesman for the Yoruba socio-political group Afenifere, said Babangida\u2019s response was unacceptable and that he should \u201ctell it to the marines.\u201d\n\nSpeaking exclusively with report Ajayi said the former Head of State\u2019s explanation was unthinkable.\n\nBabangida had explained that he annulled the June 12 election to avert a coup and crisis in Nigeria.\n\nThe former Nigerian leader had insisted that Nigeria would have experienced an outbreak of crisis, if the election was not annulled.\n\nJune 12 election has been rated the freest and fairest election in Nigeria.\n\nMKO Abiola had been declared the winner of the election before it was annulled. This prevented him from ruling Nigeria.\n\nHowever, Ajayi faulted IBB\u2019s explanation, stressing that he could have averted the coup.\n\nAccording to Ajayi: \u201cIBB\u2019s explanation of the annulment is coming far too late. He said it was to prevent a coup. As at that time, he was the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria; if he suspected any officer was going to lead the coup, what stopped him from retiring those officers? And if there was a proven reason, the person could even be tried for treasonable felony.\n\n\u201cSo, telling us now that it was to avert a coup is not acceptable. So because some people are likely to rebel against somebody, that is why you will not install him as a king even after he has been declared by the kingmakers? Just because one or two people are not happy, so you will not install him?\n\n\u201cWe are saying that the reason being given by Babangida is unthinkable and just an excuse. He can tell that to the marine.\u201d",

          "text": "Fight against human trafficking has received a boost as International Organization for Migration, IOM, in collaboration with the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, NAPTIP, launched new tools to ensure a standardized approach to the identification, referral, and protection of Victims of Trafficking, VoTs.\n\nThe tools recently launched in Abuja coincided with the 2021 World Day against Trafficking in Persons, WDATIP, with the theme \u201cVictims Voices take the Lead\u2019.\n\nIn the press statement issued to journalists, IOM said that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation of vulnerable persons who, due to their worsened economic situation, were recruited for labor or sexual exploitation.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cIn 2018, the Walk Free Foundation estimated there were almost 1.4 million individuals living in modern slavery in Nigeria. Research also shows that two-thirds of Nigerian victims of trafficking are victims of domestic human trafficking. The tools developed are a first step in providing a voice to the victims as it allows them to share their experiences, help service providers facilitate referral pathways, and provide comprehensive protection services.\u201d\n\nAlso, the IOM Nigerian Chief of Mission, Franz Celestin was quoted in the statement as saying that, \u201cThis initiative will strengthen the identification process and ensure that more VoTs are referred to the right services.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the profiling exercise would strengthen the understanding of Trafficking in Persons in Nigeria and inform the development of national policies and future programming.\n\nAccording to him, data collected from screening activities will be disaggregated by sex, age, forms of exploitation, and other relevant indicators. The aim of the identification tools is to provide first-line officials with harmonized tools to effectively identify and refer victims of human trafficking in line with the National Referral Mechanism.\n\nHe explained that the process for the development of the tools commenced in November 2020 and received reviews from relevant stakeholders to ensure that the tools are comprehensive and stand the test of time.\n\nCelestin said the tools will be piloted in Edo, Lagos, and Delta states where NAPTIP officials would be trained on how to use them, adding that screening and reporting tools will be rolled out along the Nigerian border at points of entry and exit.\n\n\u201cVictims of human trafficking need to be protected to ensure they live a life of integrity devoid of any form of dehumanization and degrading treatment\u201d the statement quoted NAPTIP Director-General Sen. Basheer Garba Mohammed.\n\nNigerian Pilot gathered that since 2017, IOM Nigeria has provided support to 21,771 returnees of which 2,302 are VOTs.\n\nThe long-term goal is to ensure these tools are integrated into an information management system, IMS, that all stakeholders can easily access.",

          "text": "Chances of an amicable and swift resolution of the dispute between striking resident doctors and the Federal Government took a hit on Friday as both sides stuck to their positions, trading accusations.\n\nThe Federal Government insists that the doctors have no basis for the strike they started on Monday and has asked them to resume work, but the doctors say the government must honour their agreement and meet their demands before they pick up their tools again.\n\nOn Friday morning, the President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, said the striking doctors will not heed the call made by the Minister of Health a day earlier asking them to resume work.\n\nDr Osagie Ehanire said on Thursday that there was no basis for the nationwide strike as most of the issues raised by the doctors (seven out of 12) were the responsibility of state governments and not the Federal Government. According to him, the five issues that the Federal Government were responsible for were already being addressed.\n\nBut NARD disagreed, faulting the government\u2019s approach to the matter.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have signed an MOA (memorandum of agreement) with us and (say) everything you have said, and you have not even called us since the beginning of 2nd of August, 8 am, when the strike started,\u201d the NARD President said during an appearance on Channels TV\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you\u2019re telling us is that we signed a document and we are not honouring it, (and) we need to resume work. They need to stand up to their responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThis position, and the subsequent refusal of the striking doctors to resume work, angered the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige who threatened to utilise all the labour laws and tools at his disposal to ensure that the doctors face consequences for the strike. This includes the \u201cNo work, No pay\u201d rule.\n\nDr Ngige is also not ready to negotiate with the doctors.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t meet them,\u201d the visibly angry minister said when asked about the possibility of talks between both parties during an appearance on Politics Today on Friday night.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t; because I have other things to do\u201d.\n\nLike the Health Minister, Dr Ngige argues that it was wrong for the doctors to have gone on strike being essential workers.\n\nHe also dismissed the position of the doctors that the Federal Government had not communicated with them or fulfilled the terms of the agreement reached on April 10 when they suspended an earlier strike.\n\nRather than hold talks with the doctors, the minister said he invoked the \u201cno work, no pay\u201d rule on Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThey will not receive money for the period that they are on strike and it will never count for a pensionable position in their career,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if that was a fair position, the minister declared that \u201cthat\u2019s what it is\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven the ILO supports it because they (doctors) offer essential services,\u201d he said, adding that they were not supposed to go on strike without notifying him 15 days prior.\n\nAlthough the minister admitted that NARD sent him \u201ca communique\u201d of their meeting, detailing their grievances and the resolution to go on strike, it was not the same as a trade dispute notification which he insists is what they ought to have sent to him.\n\nOfficials of NARD maintain that the government left them with no other choice than to go on strike as the issues resident doctors were facing were serious ones.\n\n\u201cUsually there is no negotiation done until we go on a strike,\u201d said the President of the Association of Resident Doctors at the National Hospital in Abuja, Dr Akanimo Ebong told Channels Television on Monday when the strike started.\n\nThe doctors are seeking the immediate payment of all salaries owed to all house officers, including March salaries (regardless of quota system).\n\nThey are also asking for an upward review of the hazard allowance to 50 per cent of consolidated basic salaries of all health workers and the payment of the outstanding COVID-19 inducement allowance, especially in state-owned-tertiary institutions, among other things.\n\nThis time around, even the strike has not led to talks, and with both sides maintaining their position, the strike has dragged into a sixth day, amid concerns that it can have major implications for health care delivery in the country and the race to halt the spread of COVID-19.",
          "summary": "Chances of an amicable and swift resolution of the dispute between striking resident doctors and the Federal Government took a hit on Friday as both sides stuck to their positions, trading accusations.\nOn Friday morning, the President of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, said the striking doctors will not heed the call made by the Minister of Health a day earlier asking them to resume work.\n\u201cThe first thing you\u2019re telling us is that we signed a document and we are not honouring it, (and) we need to resume work.\nLike the Health Minister, Dr Ngige argues that it was wrong for the doctors to have gone on strike being essential workers.\nOfficials of NARD maintain that the government left them with no other choice than to go on strike as the issues resident doctors were facing were serious ones.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has again called on President Muhammadu Buhari to launch an investigation into ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), responsible for spending 881 billion naira without appropriation.\n\nIn the open letter dated 7 August, 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cThese damning revelations suggest a grave violation of the public trust, the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and international human rights and anti-corruption standards. Spending of public funds without appropriation will create opportunities for corruption.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cAny such investigation should establish whether public funds have been mismanaged, diverted or stolen. Anyone suspected to be responsible should face prosecution as appropriate, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and any misappropriated public funds should be fully recovered.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cInvestigating and prosecuting anyone who spent public funds without appropriation and authorisation will send a powerful message that this illegal and unconstitutional practice will not be tolerated under your watch.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cComplying with constitutional requirements and international standards on spending of public funds would ensure effective and efficient management of public resources, and put the country\u2019s wealth and resources to work for the common good of all Nigerians. public debts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to part 2 of the 2018 annual audited report by the Auditor-General of the Federation, \u20a6880,894,733,084.811 was spent by 367 MDAs without appropriation. 14 MDAs reportedly spent \u20a6162,924,630,539.20 without appropriation. Similarly, 100 MDAs spent \u20a6229,136,261,325.73 on \u2018social benefits\u2019 without appropriation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, 151 MDAs exceeded their 2018 Overhead Appropriation by \u20a6476,625,502,048.87 without any evidence of supplementary appropriation or approved virement to support the extra-budgetary spending. 102 MDAs also reportedly spent \u20a612,208,339,171.01 on subsidies without budgetary provisions.\n\nThe Auditor-General is concerned that the money may have been misappropriated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdentifying and naming and shaming those who spent public funds without appropriation would improve the chances of success of your government\u2019s oft-repeated commitment to fight corruption and end the impunity of perpetrators. It will also serve the public interest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSERAP is seriously concerned about the adverse consequences of unconstitutional and poor management of public resources on the human rights of poor and vulnerable Nigerians, including denying them access to essential public goods and services such as quality healthcare, education, and clean water.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic confidence and accountability in public administration are instrumental to the prevention of corruption and greater efficiency. Transparent and accountable public financial management is a key pillar of good governance, and of vital importance to provide public goods and services to citizens, as well as to create and maintain fair and sustainable economic and social conditions in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorruption thrives in contexts that provide opportunities to engage in illicit conduct, widespread motives to take advantage of such opportunities and weak controls.\n\nThe prevention of corruption is more effective environments that minimize opportunities, comply with constitutional and international legal requirements and standards, as well as encourage integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to direct Mrs Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning to publish widely the details of MDAs and public officials involved in the unconstitutional spending of public funds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to ask the heads of the MDAs involved to explain why they reportedly spent public funds without appropriation, contrary to constitutional and international requirements, and standards of transparency and accountability in the preparation, processes and decisions on their budgets, and to return any money spent without approval to the public treasury.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 80(2) of the Nigerian Constitution provides that no money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation except to meet expenditure that is charged upon the fund by the Constitution or where the issue of the money has been authorized by an Appropriation Act, Supplementary Appropriation Act or an Act passed in pursuance of section 81 of the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, articles 5 and 9 of the UN Convention against Corruption to which Nigeria is a state party impose legal obligations on your government to ensure proper management of public affairs and public funds, and to promote sound and transparent administration of public affairs and public property.\u201d\n\nMr. Malami, Professor Bolaji Owasanoye, Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa, Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and Mrs. Ahmed were all copied on the letter.",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated last year\u2019s dividend of $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria.\n\nThe company reported the payout recently during the release of preliminary financial results for six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nMTN had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company had said in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75 per cent to 85 per cent drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75 per cent stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked N600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in the country.\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1 percent year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to N790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6 per cent to N417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8per cent year-on-year to 55.6 million.

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo held a meeting with President of Benin Republic, Patrice Talon in the first week of August to seek soft landing for an agitator for Yoruba Nation, Chief Adeniyi Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho), a report by TheCable has revealed.\n\nApart from Obasanjo\u2019s intervention, THISDAY checks revealed that prominent leaders of Yoruba have been lobbying the international community and British to prevail on the Government of Benin Republic to reject Nigeria\u2019s request to extradite the embattled agitator.\n\nThese moves coincided with a revelation by Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu penultimate Saturday that the people of South-west states \u201care working behind the scenes concerning Igboho\u2019s apprehension in the Republic of Benin.\u201d\n\nCiting anonymous diplomatic sources, TheCable reported that Obasanjo was in Benin Republic in the first week of August 2021 and held a meeting with a Beninese leader on the travail of Igboho.\n\nThe report claimed that the former president travelled to Zanzibar, an island in Tanzania, on August 1 and re-routed to the Francophone country on his way back to Nigeria.\n\nThe report, further, claimed: \u201cHe was said to have travelled to Benin Republic in the guise of condoling with Nicephore Soglo who recently lost his wife \u2013 Roseline Soglo. Roseline died on July 25 at the age of 87 in Cotonou. Soglo was president of the Benin Republic from 1991 to 1996.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the diplomatic sources revealed that Obasanjo travelled to Zanzibar on August 1. Perhaps to conceal his trip, he re-routed to the Benin Republic. He was to condole with former President Soglo who recently lost his wife.\n\nAnother source cited by TheCable said: \u201cHe also met with Patrice Talon. The purpose of the meeting was to seek soft-landing for Sunday Igboho. He is asking the Beninese authorities to grant the embattled agitator asylum and not to return him to Nigeria. The former president intervened on the request of some south-west leaders.\u201d\n\nA prominent socio-cultural leader in the South-west last night confirmed the veracity of the report, claiming that the leaders of Yoruba had held a meeting with Obasanjo and pleaded with him to use his diplomatic channels to secure Igboho asylum in the Benin Republic.\n\nThe leader, who spoke anonymously with THISDAY, revealed that prominent leaders of Yoruba had been lobbying the international community to prevail on the Republic of Benin not to honour Nigeria\u2019s request to extradite Igboho.\n\nThe leader said: \u201cWe have lobbied contacts in french government. We have also lobbied British Government. However, France has much influence on the Benin Republic. There is every indication that the Benin Republic will not extradite Igboho.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, they will not extradite him because we pointed the attention of France to the judicial process in Nigeria. Under the present administration, the judicial process in Nigeria has been compromised.\n\n\u201cIt is not wise to expose Igboho to face the compromised judicial process in a country where the government does not obey court orders. Most times, the court dances to the tune of the government.\n\n\u201cEven where the courts have been courageous, the government has ignored them. Nigeria does not have a regime that upholds the rules of democracy and transparent judicial process. And the process cannot be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe leader pointed out that it was not difficult to convince the diplomatic community, especially Britain, France and the United States, given the antecedence of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration\u2019s disregard to the rule of law and judicial decisions.\n\nThe leader explained that the representatives of these countries \u201ctoo are living witnesses to the socio-political dynamics in Nigeria. We had interface with all embassies in Nigeria. We told them our own stand.\n\n\u201cWe also told them the consequences for them. But they always look at the national interest before they make their decisions. We believe they cannot wait for Nigeria to explode before they act. We believe strongly that they will do whatever they can to salvage Nigeria,\u201d the South-west leader said.\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) had invaded Igboho\u2019s residence in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, killing two persons and arresting 12 supporters.\n\nSubsequently, the operatives of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) had arrested Igboho at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou while attempting to flee to Germany after the operatives of the DSS raided his residence.\n\nIgboho\u2019s apprehension had ignited legal and diplomatic fireworks to secure the release of the embattled agitator from the custody of the Benin Republic.\n\nWith the intense lobby to secure Igboho\u2019s release, Sanwo-Olu had disclosed that the governors of South-west \u201care working behind the scenes concerning the apprehension and prosecution of Igboho at the Republic of Benin.\u201d\n\nThe governor had said although most of the strategies are not being made public, there are ongoing plans by southwest governors to address the situation.\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",

          "text": "As the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) targets to acquire a 20 per cent stake, translating to 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) capacity from the brand new 650,000 bpd Dangote Refinery for $2.7 billion, Hollyfrontier is acquiring 97-year-old 115,000 bpd refinery from Sinclair Oil for $2.6 billion.\n\nThe deal signed by HollyFrontier and its affiliate, Holly Energy Partners (HEP), to acquire almost all of Sinclair Oil\u2019s refining, renewable diesel, and logistics assets for $2.6 billion, is therefore, not similar to the planned acquisition of the 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery by the NNPC, a top official of the corporation told THISDAY Saturday night.\n\nThis is coming as the NNPC has lost roughly N9.181 billion to shutdowns, mostly as a result of host community workers and contractors\u2019 protests in the Niger Delta, a review of reports on its activities from January to July this year, has shown.\n\nNNPC and Dangote\u2019s refinery deal caused outrage earlier on Saturday, especially on social media, with a section of Nigerians comparing it with HollyFrontier\u2019s business agreement with Sinclair.\n\nThey argued that if HollyFrontier could buy the 678,000 barrels per day facility for $2.6 billion, there was no business sense in NNPC acquiring 20 per cent of Dangote refinery\u2019s 650, 000 for $2.7 billion.\n\nBut a top NNPC source said that people were erroneously interpreting the deal to mean that HollyFrontier is buying 678, 000 bpd refining capacity from Sinclair for $2.6 billion.\n\nThe source explained that it is the combined business: HollyFrontier and Sinclair, that will have the refining capacity of 678, 000 bpd after the acquisition.\n\nThe source further disclosed that HollyFrontier already has refineries, and is only adding Sinclair\u2019s two refineries, with a combined capacity of 115, 000 bpd to its portfolio.\n\nOut of this 115,000 bpd capacity, the first refinery with a capacity of 85,000 bpd was built in 1924, that is 97 years ago, while the second refinery with a capacity of 30,000 bpd, was built in 1992.\n\n\u201cSo, only two refineries are being purchased. As can be seen from Sinclair Oil\u2019s website, one has a capacity of 85, 000 bpd and was built in 1924, the other has a capacity of 30, 000 bpd and was built in 1992,\u201d explained the NNPC source, who spoke in confidence.\n\nAccordingly to the source, a refinery with 50 per cent petrol yield and zero per cent Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO) is way more valuable than a refinery with say 30 per cent petrol and 20 per cent LPFO.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because PMS (petrol) is way more valuable than LPFO,\u201d it noted.\n\nAccording to the NNPC top source, a new refinery with 95 per cent availability is way more valuable than an old refinery with say 85 per cent availability, noting that this is simply because the new refinery will be making money in many more days in a year.\n\n\u201cIn addition, every manufacturing plant has fixed costs; so, a small refinery will have higher fixed costs per barrel and therefore lower profitability,\u201d the source stressed.\n\nThe Dangote refinery, with a single crude oil distillation unit, when completed, around mid-next year will be the largest single-train refinery in the world.\n\nCorporation Loses N9.1bn to Community, Workers\u2019 Protests\n\nIn another development, the NNPC has lost roughly N9.181 billion to shutdowns, mostly as a result of host community workers and contractors\u2019 protests in the Niger Delta, a review of reports on its activities from January to July this year has shown.\n\nPublic demonstrations due to alleged negligence of the host oil communities where oil companies operate have been a major cause of disruptions to the national oil company\u2019s operations in the region, which produces Nigeria\u2019s and gas resources.\n\nThe NNPC maintains a Joint Venture (JV) relationship with oil companies in the Niger Delta, with such shutdowns causing huge losses to both the national oil company and its partners.\n\nIn July, NNPC\u2019s total losses hit N1.644 billion due to such disruptions, while JV cost recovery was $147 million or about N56.6 billion when converted with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate at the time.\n\nGovernment priority projects cost $40.5 million, about N20 billion, while export crude oil was N4.48 billion and Nigeria LNG feedstock was N13.8 billion, whereas feedstock gas arrears stood at N1.5 billion.\n\nFor its June operations, the NNPC lost N1.109 billion in terms of lost products as a result of shutdowns, whereas export crude volume was 2.7 million barrels, valued at N69.3 billion or $181.1 million, going by the CBN\u2019s N382.80 to a dollar exchange rate at the time.\n\nIn May, total products losses were worth N961.3 million, a huge difference of about N680 million from the succeeding month.\n\nStill, in May, government priority projects gulped N15.8 billion while export crude oil stood at N723.8 million and export gas was N6.09 billion, as NLNG feedstock gas recorded during the month stood at N20 billion.\n\nIn the preceding month of April, product losses due to shutdowns stood at N1.639 billion, export crude was N35.7 billion and export gas was worth N10.1 billion.\n\nSimilarly, in March, product losses recorded, according to the national oil company, hit N1.618 billion, while export crude oil remained N30.9 million, an equivalent of N11.7 billion, given an exchange rate of N378.88.\n\nIn the same vein, February figures showed that the NNPC export crude oil was N9.2 billion, while Nigeria LNG feedstock gas was worth N15.904 billion and 6 million barrels of crude were lost to shutdowns, resulting in about N1.41 billion.\n\nFor its January operations, the national oil company forfeited 2 million barrels to shutdowns, due to host community issues, generator failures, maintenance, sabotage, among others, standing at a loss of about N800 million, going by the N380 exchange rate.\n\nMost of the losses were due to the activities of disgruntled community workers and contractors who had issues to sort out with the oil companies. For instance, according to NNPC data in March, SPDC declared force majeure in January, due to the shutdown of Trans Forcados Pipeline (TFP) as a result of community issues over outstanding payments.\n\nIn April, it was reported that Addax production into Brass was curtailed due to workers strike, while Seplat shut in 43, 000 barrels of oil due to third-party interference.\n\nIts May report indicated that Pan Ocean shut down production due to workers\u2019 action, same with Jisike, which was abandoned as a result of industrial action by petroleum workers.\n\nAdditionally, in July, NNPC announced that Eroton production was shut down as it was vandalised, coupled with what it described as community disturbance. In the same month, Seplat Jisike\u2019s low stock was shut in due to the Addax contract personnel strike.\n\nIn June, Batan station was shut down due to unpaid community workers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 salaries, the same way that Kokori station was closed due to the same problem.\n\nAlso, Aiteo shut down some flow stations due to community issues around the same time, the NNPC data stated, while Jones Creek station completely went down due to unpaid salaries of surveillance contractors.\n\nSimilarly, in April, the Egwa flow station came down due to community agitations, leading to a loss of 36, 000 barrels, while Olomoro and Uzere suffered the same fate due to agitations by community workers and unpaid contract staff salaries.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell had recently begun massive divestment from its onshore and shallow water assets, saying its long-term business plan does not align with its activities in the area, with recent information revealing that it plans to completely sell off one of its subsidiaries, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
