          "title": "SERAP sues Buhari over missing N881bn in 367 MDAs",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) over his failure to probe allegations that over \u20a6880bn of public funds are missing from 367 ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nSERAP in the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1281/2021 filed last week at the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeks, \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to promptly investigate the alleged missing N881bn of public funds and to ensure the prosecution of those suspected to be responsible, and the full recovery of any missing, mismanaged or diverted public funds.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the suit follows the allegations contained in part 2 of the 2018 annual audited report by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation that \u20a6880,894,733,084.811 was spent by 367 MDAs without any appropriation.\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application, as it would improve respect for the rights of Nigerians, and improve their access to essential public goods and services, which ought to be provided by the indicted MDAs.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has a constitutional duty to ensure the investigation and prosecution of allegations of corruption, as well as recovery of any missing public funds. Section 15[5] of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution [as amended], requires the Buhari administration to abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nSERAP added that the missing funds have hindered the ability of the MDAs to meet the needs of the citizens.\n\nIt noted, \u201cThe alleged missing public funds have hampered the ability of the indicted MDAs to meet the needs of average citizens, as the missing funds could have helped the government to invest in key public goods and services, and to improve access of Nigerians to these goods and services.\u201d\n\nMoreso, joined in the suit as Respondents are the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN; and the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyer Oluwadare read in part: \u201cThe failure to investigate the allegations of grand corruption contained in part 2 of the 2018 annual audited report constitutes a grave violation of the duty placed on the Nigerian government to take appropriate measures to promote transparency and accountability in the management of public finances.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandamus is a high prerogative writ which lies to secure the performance of public duty. It gives a command that a duty of a public nature which normally, though not necessarily is imposed by statute but is neglected or refused to be done after due demand, be done.\n\n\u201cIf there is a discretion to perform the duty, the court has the power to examine whether the discretion to refuse to act has been properly exercised.\u201d\n\nIt noted that the recovery of the missing funds would reduce pressure on the government to borrow money to fund the budget.\n\n\u201cRecovering the alleged missing public funds would reduce the pressure on the Federal Government to borrow more money to fund the budget, enable the authorities to meet the country\u2019s constitutional and international obligations, and reduce the growing level of public debts.\n\n\u201cThese damning revelations suggest a grave violation of the public trust, the Nigerian Constitution of 1999, and international human rights and anti-corruption standards. Spending public funds without appropriation will create opportunities for corruption.\n\n\u201cTransparent and accountable public financial management is a key pillar of good governance, and of vital importance to provide public goods and services to citizens, as well as to create and maintain fair and sustainable economic and social conditions in the country,\u201d the statement read.\n\nHowever, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "title": "Why traditional Lagosians must take charge, stop selling landed inheritances indiscriminately \u2013Don",
          "text": "The Dean of College of Humanities at the Tai Solarin University of Education, Prof. Rasheed Ajetunmobi, has urged indigenous Lagosians to stop selling their landed inheritances indiscriminately.\n\nAjetunmobi warned that with the rate of the sale of lands and property by autochthonous Lagosians to non-indigenes, the true sons and daughters of the soil might be displaced entirely from the state in the coming years.\n\nThe don stated this on Friday during a lecture delivered on the occasion of the first Distinguished Lecture Series of the Department of History and International Studies at the Lagos State University, Ojo.\n\nAjetunmobi delivered the lecture to a packed gathering of university administrators, lecturers, students, other members of the university community and guests.\n\nTracing the history of Lagos from the 15th to 18th century, the academic said the Awori people, the first dwellers of the geographical entity now known as modern Lagos, were not criminals, adding that many of those committing crimes in Lagos are the 20th and 21st century settlers who had no \u201cidentifiable extended family houses.\u201d\n\nHe stated that Lagos, a bursting population of over 20 million people, was a melting pot of cultures, and therefore \u201chospitable to a fault.\u201d\n\nAjetunmobi stated that the willingness by original Lagosians to accommodate non-indigenes had been abused by non-Lagosians who now claim Lagos is a \u201cno man\u2019s land.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis concept of No man\u2019s Land emanated from the extreme hospitality of the traditional Lagosians and their willingness to accommodate other people.\n\n\u201cFor the omo abule s\u2019owo- the Awori land barons- they are gradually learning not to sell their inheritance at miserable prices. Many indigenes of Lagos State can no longer point to their family houses in Lagos, Ido, Ebute metta, Surulere or New Lagos and by extension Epe, Ikorodu, Badagry and Aworiland.\n\n\u201cMany of those committing crimes in Lagos, apart from land issues, are the 20th and 21st century settlers in Lagos State. They have no identifiable extended family houses; some have committed crimes in their homeland and escaped to Lagos and there is nobody to report them to. Others were principally sent to Lagos to make money by whatever means and to return home with their gains at the end of every year for celebration and re-polishing of their instrument.\n\n\u201cWho would tell our grandchildren and generations to come that the indigenous Lagosians were not essentially criminals until the arrival of the 20th and 21st century settlers?\u201d\n\nContinuing, the don claimed the criminality introduced in the state by non-indigenes, had painted a suspicious outlook of Lagos to visitors and outsiders.\n\n\u201cFor almost a century now, people coming to Lagos for the first time are often advised and warned concerning the land and the people of Lagos State by their friends and relations. The common views have been that Lagos is the land of dupes, tricksters, swindlers, magicians, killers, cheats, and \u2018Gbajue\u2019 as sometimes used. It is the milk and honey that have served as inducement or pull factor to people of other areas who see Lagos as a virgin land for exploitation, sharing of cake and looting.\n\n\u201cImmigrants on leaving home are often accompanied with the prayer; you will bring back home the reward of your exploitation in Lagos (Amen) \u2018Wa ko ere oko dele.\u2019 Whereas, the aboriginal inhabitants have no other home than Lagos State,\u201d he said.\n\nAjetunmobi further stated that the economic attraction of Lagos is responsible for the increasing number of beggars littering the nooks and crannies of the state.\n\n\u201cPerhaps more than any state in Nigeria, Lagos State houses the highest number of beggars. Traditionally, Lagosians are not beggars even those that were called alagbe \u2013 were the traditional musicians who praise-sing to be rewarded. The real beggars gradually increased in number from 1960 onwards as a result of Lagos hospitality and belief that emphasises appeasement, sacrifices, Zakat and Zadaqat,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe academic lamented that \u201csome of the indigenous people of Lagos State today have been subsumed, while some have developed lukewarm attitudes. This view has completely obliterated the traditional faces of Lagos and Lagosians, if care is not taken, the concept of Lagosians will die a natural death.\n\n\u201cThe people should see themselves as one and work in unison to be in charge of their inheritances. A situation where those who cannot point to their ancestral family houses in Lagos State are the ones running our affairs and telling us what to do must be checked. Onigba lo npe igba ni ankara t\u2019won fi ba ko ile \u2013 If you call your land a dumping ground or packer of rubbish, it would be used appropriately. We must not be on-lookers; Frank Fanon said \u201cevery onlooker is either a coward or a traitor.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

No fewer than three suspects have so far been arrested in connection to the seizures.\n\nAlso, arely a week after she was arrested and granted bail for attempting to smuggle drugs concealed in cassava flour meal called \u2018akpu\u2019 into NDLEA cell for a suspect in custody, a nursing mother who claims to be a part-time 400-level student of International Studies and Diplomacy at the University of Benin, Mariam Adetilewa Dirisu has again been arrested for trafficking in 5kg skunk and 8.1grams of Molly.\n\nThe 35-year-old mother of a 2 month-old-baby was first arrested on 21st October by the Edo state Command of the Agency.\n\nChairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) had on the same day directed that she be counselled and released immediately because of the young baby she was carrying.\n\nCuriously, a controlled delivery operation carried out by operatives of the Delta state Command of the Agency on Saturday 30th October again led to the arrest of Mariam who had ordered for the drugs from Lagos even while still on bail for an earlier offence.\n\nIn Ondo state, no less than 1,645kilograms of cannabis were seized in three interdiction operations in parts of the state.\n\nOperatives had on 28th October stormed Emure cannabis farm camp where 313kilograms of cannabis were seized and seven suspects: Paul Godwin; Michael Nnaji; Ezugu Lucky; Omolu Sunday; Simon Taiwo; David Udofia; and M. Suleiman arrested.\n\nOperatives had the previous day raided the Ipele-Idoani forest where 534kgs of abandoned compressed cannabis were recovered just as a total of 798kilograms of cannabis were seized from two suspects; Gbenga Falodun and Faseyitan Opeyemi at Ikare junction, Owo area of the state.\n\nAlso recovered from them was a white Mercedes Benz truck Lagos LSR 06 XW and monetary exhibit of N20, 000.\n\nBabafemi added that, \u201cAt least, two suspected fake security agents; Umar Ibrahim and Sadiq Abubakar as well as their accomplice, Auwal Hassan have been arrested in Kogi state while conveying a total of 105.4kilograms of cannabis from Ondo state to Kaduna on Saturday 30th October in a Mercedes Benz C 180 car with registration number Abuja BWR 924 KH.\n\n\u201cRaids at three black spots in Oshodi, Ikeja and Ogba areas of Lagos State on 23rd October have led to the arrest of a 15-year-old female SS II student of Idi \u2013 Araba Senior High School, Walaka Adams, who was arrested at No. 72 Mafoluku Road, Oshodi, with 100 grams of cannabis sativa; Sodiq Ganun, a 24-year-old wielder with 200grams of cannabis at the same address and Tajudeen Azeez, arrested at Ipodo, Ikeja, with 9 grams of Cocaine.\n\n\u201cAt a drug joint in Ogba area of Ikeja, different quantities of abandoned drugs such as Molly, Rohypnol and Codeine based syrup were recovered\u201d.\n\nWhile commending the officers and men of the MMIA, Delta, Ondo, Kogi and Lagos Commands of the Agency for not resting on their oars, Gen. Marwa charged them and their counterparts in other Commands to remain resolute in the ongoing efforts to cut access and availability of illicit drugs across the country.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

ASSISTANT ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR, GBENGA BADA, writes on how, in the last decade, MultiChoice Nigeria has gone a notch higher to position itself as the go-to platform for some of the globe\u2019s biggest reality TV shows, drama series all-round entertainment for the whole family.\n\nWith competition as fierce as ever, media companies and marketers have relentlessly engaged viewers to win them and keep them. One of the ways has been through exciting and innovative local and international content.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOver and over again, consumers have continued to query the value offered in comparison with the subscription pricing and repeatedly, MultiChoice Nigeria has remained on its toes in matching viewers\u2019 desires with innovating local and international content.\n\nMultiChoice Nigeria joins a list of well-funded media companies that support new formats and experiences while seeking to differentiate their offerings from the increasing volume of content rolled out by a growing roster of competitors through new channels, shows, and series. Predictably, competition for consumers\u2019 attention and spending remains intense among pay-tv companies as consumers gain access to new content from an array of increasingly content providers.\n\nWhile pricing remains a significant topic in not only the Nigerian pay-tv market but also the global market, consumers continue to question the value they get from these cable networks from time to time.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, with the pay-tv companies working hard to outdo themselves, consumers continue to yearn for more entertaining content.\n\nChief Executive Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe, reaffirmed the pay tv\u2019s commitment to making services more accessible saying, \u201cAt MultiChoice, our customers are at the heart of everything we do, and while we pride ourselves on being the nation\u2019s leading entertainment platform.

Tejumola also revealed that brand new series like Dilemma, Venge, Movement Japa and The Rishantes will join a long list of existing shows and series that are returning for a new season. \u201cExisting shows like \u2018Turn Up Friday\u2019, \u2018Owambe Saturday\u2019, \u2018Music Buzz\u2019, \u2018Unmarried\u2019, \u2018Date My Family\u2019, \u2018Judging Matters\u2019, \u2018Shoot Your Shot\u2019, \u2018Love Come Back\u2019, \u2018The Flatmates\u2019, \u2018The Johnsons\u2019, \u2018My Siblings and I\u2019, and more will return with new seasons while brand new shows, \u2018Movement Japa\u2019, \u2018Dilemma\u2019, \u2018Venge\u2019, and \u2018The Rishante\u2019, will quell viewers\u2019 yearnings for more till 2022.\u201d Dr. Tejumola expressed.\n\nDr. Tejumola also revealed that viewers who were further given an edge can expect even more lifestyle content from Honey TV, especially locally-made content from Nigeria.

He said, \u201cWe have something for everyone \u2013 especially on MTV Base, BET Africa, and Nickelodeon.\u201d\n\nDespite the array of channels and content served to viewers by MultiChoice Nigeria, the pay-tv company raises the bar with its on-demand video platform, Showmax.

That the people relish on those golden moments when the PDP held sway at the centre is not in doubt. That citizens are yearning for the return of PDP at the centre as the 2023 elections draw nearer, is equally not in doubt.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, have a duty not to disappoint our teaming supporters. We have to take back our country as we have always done. We have to save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf we could force the country out of the clutches of the military, we can do this one huge task \u2013 push the people who don\u2019t know the true definition of good governance and national coexistence out of power. This is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 National Convention, presents a starting point for the Nigeria rescue mission. I commend the decision of all the organs of the party, especially the BoT and NEC for recognizing that the party has a beautiful chance to reinvent itself with this convention.\u201d\n\nFintiri noted that the outcome of the convention would have a direct bearing on the strength of the PDP as it moves into the future.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the choices before us have been made easier by the power of consensus which is an integral part of our processes.\n\n\u201cThat most of the positions have emerged with single contestants is not only a pointer to our bond of familyhood, but a demonstration of our entrenched democratic culture and strength as a party determined to soldier on in unison,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn his part, the acting national chairman of the PDP, Yemi Akinwonmi, while declaring the convention open, charged aggrieved members of the party to bury the hatchet and close ranks, in the overall interest of the party.\n\nAkinwonmi stated that there was need for the PDP leaders to put the interest of the opposition party and the country above their personal interests.\n\n\u201cI am personally happy to associate myself with the winning party in the coming 2023 election. I call on all members of this party to come together, bury our personal, individual and collective differences and put PDP and interest of Nigeria above any consideration,\u201d the PDP chairman stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From John Adams, Minna\n\nTroops of the Nigerian Army and gunmen were engaged in a heavy gunfire on Friday night at Pandogari community in Rafi Local Government area of Niger State.\n\nA source at Pandogari community told Sunday Sun that about 100 heavily armed men, three each on motorcycles attempted to storm the town to kill and rustle cattle when they met stiff resistance from the soldiers and members of the local vigilantes.\n\nThe gunmen suspected to be fleeing Zamfara and Katsina states due to the military operations going on there, invaded the town at about 6:00 pm on Friday, and made their way straight to the military base in an attempt to first of all sack the soldiers, but met fully prepared Nigerian soldiers who engaged them in a fierce gun battle.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nAccording to our source, the soldiers engaged the gunmen for several hours and later called for reinforcement, which promptly arrived.\n\nOur source further disclosed that in less than one hour, no fewer than 20 trucks from Kagara loaded with armed soldiers and another 10 trucks from Birnin Gwari arrived Pandogari, and overwhelmed the gunmen who quickly retreated to the Allawa forest.\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen suffered heavy casualties as there were bloodstains and some of their belongings seen everywhere in the bush on Saturday morning. They, however, managed to evacuate the dead and the injured ones.\n\nA top local vigilante official, who spoke to Sunday Sun on condition of anonymity, described the battle as \u201cvery intense and serious.\u201d\n\nHe praised the gallantry displayed by the soldiers, and equally commended the military authority for the quick response to the troops. He said that despite the reinforcement, the soldiers later resulted in the use of rocket-propelled grenades and other sophisticated weapons due to a large number of gunmen. The strategy devastated the gunmen and made them retreat into the forest.\n\nThe vigilante official said from the look of the gunmen \u201cthey were Fulani who are very young but not from Nigeria because of their mode of dressing and their intonation,\u201d which he pointed out was completely different from the Fulani in Nigeria.\n\nHe further hinted that the gunmen might likely come back to engage the soldiers because the presence of the military and the local vigilantes had blocked all their routes and were finding it difficult to operate in the area.\n\n\u201cThe bandits were equally looking for a base in the state because of the military operations in Zamfara and Katsina states. They have been dislodged there so they are desperately looking for a base in Niger state,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane confirmed the story, adding \u201cwhat the security men did was to repel the attack.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

For this, she has vowed never to start a family without proper planning.\n\nIn this interview, pretty and voluptuous Moyo Lawal opened up on her celibate years, reasons she\u2019s still single and her need for a crazy lover. Please enjoy it.\n\nCan you forgive and take back a cheating partner?\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nI don\u2019t see my man cheating as a big deal. What I don\u2019t like is don\u2019t come and be pretending that you are holier than thou, and don\u2019t neglect your duties. Just cheat with sense and use protection.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on people bringing their private relationship matters on social media?\n\nI am of the opinion that we are all wired differently. You can put whatever you want on the Internet so far you are ready to deal with the consequences.\n\nYou\u2019re such a beautiful lady, why are you still single?\n\nLet us go and ask God \u2018biko\u2019. I am beautiful? Eeeh, thank you!\n\nDo you think your career is one of the reasons you\u2019re not married yet?\n\nIt was more because before I started my skincare business a couple of years ago, I didn\u2019t have a stable income. Even though I was working regularly as an actor, I couldn\u2019t actually make a budget for the year. So, I wasn\u2019t ready to start a family without being able to plan properly. Nothing terrifies me more than bringing children into this world to suffer.\n\nWhat has stardom deprived you of?\n\nStardom almost deprived me of an opportunity to have a regular life, but when I started my business, I became a regular person. So, nobody can use stardom to blackmail me again (laughs).\n\nWhat prompted your decision to go celibate?\n\nCelibate? That was years ago. First, sex before marriage is still a sin, and if I am sinning, it has to count. I can\u2019t be sinning like I am eating. Two, I was waiting for Mr. Right. But now they say there is no such thing. If you follow my posts, you will notice this trend at some point. So, I started talking about following the crowd, because if you can\u2019t beat them, you join them!\n\nWhat is your best sex position?\n\nBest sex position? If I tell you, what will you do with it?\n\nWhat makes you happy?\n\nFor me, happiness is taking care of my responsibilities, making people happy and meeting my daily targets.\n\nHow affordable are your beauty products and how do you source for your ingredients?\n\nMy beauty products \u2013 Fierceglow Skincare \u2013 are very affordable and can be bought online for now. Most of our ingredients are organic, handmade with love and are sourced locally.\n\nWhat turns you off in a relationship?\n\nLies! What is new under the sun? Don\u2019t just be a hypocrite or people-pleaser, and we will not have issues.\n\nHow do you react to rumours that you and Jackie are entangled in a romantic affair with a certain married politician in Abuja?\n\nI am single, so I am at liberty to do anything I want. But please, let us stick to the truth. I can beat my chest anywhere that I have been better behaved. It has not been easy; I have had years that I abstained completely [from sex]. Do you think with that kind of self-control, I still won\u2019t have sense than most regular girls and even some married women?\n\nWhat are those qualities you look out for in a potential husband?\n\nFor me, husband material is definitely someone who has sense and empathy. He\u2019s someone who treats the waiter like a colleague, who has deep family values, but not society driven. Then, he has to be crazy to a very large extent.\n\nWhat would make you marry a much older lover?\n\nOlder lover? If he ticks my list, why not? I think it might even be easier for me because marriage is a job you have to be willing to work on, for the rest of your life. Hence, if he is much older, it might be a lot more easier; respecting his decisions and trusting him not to lead us astray because he has lived many lifetimes.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s brother opens up: IPOB now in charge of Southeast",
          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nMr Emmanuel Kanu is the brother of detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nIn this interview, he revealed that some politicians do not want agitation by IPOB to stop because they\u2019re benefitting from it.\n\nHe equally accused the Southeast governors of not being sincere about the activities of Nnamdi Kanu and his group in the region.\n\nWhile denying his brother is the cause of insecurity in the Southeast geo-political zone as alleged by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, he among other issues, proffered dialogue as solution to the present problem. Excerpts:\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nRecently, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami accused the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu of being responsible for the insecurity in the Southeast. Could this be true?\n\nNnamdi Kanu is not the problem we have in the Southeast, rather, youth unemployment, marginalization of the Southeast and nepotism, these are the problems Nigeria presently has. Nnamdi Kanu has said it time and again that he does not give life and will not take it. So, if the people of the Southeast have received any atom of justice, equity and fairness, do you think there will be any reason for unrest in the Southeast? The answer is no. So, what Malami should blame as the problem in the Southeast, is the Constitution of this country. The Constitution is one sided and people have waited for so long for the Constitution to be changed without success, so, they have turned themselves into symbol of change. They should look at people\u2019s agitation, know why they are agitating, if they should understand that, then the problem will be solved. So, the problem is not Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice specifically accused the IPOB leader of giving directives to ESN to kill security agents in the region. How true is this?\n\nESN is created to defend our farmlands against bandits and terrorists. ESN was not designed to attack anyone, their job is more of that of a vigilante. You and I are aware that so many people have been killed in the course of defending their farmlands. Since the creation of ESN, we no longer hear such ugly news and that was why ESN was created and not to attack anybody. And, the instruction is clear, don\u2019t attack anybody.\n\nAre you worried that instead of Malami focusing attention in the North where insecurity is even worst, he is talking about Nnamdi Kanu and the Southeast?\n\nI\u2019m extremely surprised, I was thinking that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Malami should have focused more on what is happening up in the North, between the Kanuris, the Gwaris and the Fulanis. Few days ago, we heard that the Boko Haram bombed the rail lines. A market in Sokoto was equally attacked and over 30 people killed, and there are so many incidents of such magnitude in the North to the extent that the governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufia has asked the Federal Government to designate bandits as terrorists. And they don\u2019t make headlines, to Malami, they don\u2019t mean anything, they are nothing. Let me advise Malami, he should first of all remove what is in his own eyes before removing that of others. He understands the problems of the country too well and he should deal with those problems, not Nnamdi Kanu. Nnamdi Kanu is not the issue, the issue is about marginalization, nepotism and the killings of our youths. And the issue remains that those you have killed their children will not fold there hands, it could be a direct revenge from them, yet they are blaming ESN, they should not do that because what goes around, comes around. This is the right time like I have always said, to sit down and deal with this problem once and for all. Everybody is hiding under Nnamdi Kanu and ESN to unleash mayhem. But if they can sit down with Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB and get these things ironed out once and for all, so that whoever that is causing these problems, we will be bold enough to pinpoint that person and have to arrest that person as well. But when they allow all these things untouched, they keep allowing problems here and there.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the proposed one-week sit-at-home order by IPOB?\n\nThe proposed one-week sit-at-home order by IPOB headed by Mazi Chika Edoziem (the head of DOS) as it stands now, he made it clear that if you do not release Nnamdi Kanu from now to November 4, then the sit-at-home will commence for one week. They could have chosen to carry arms, but the answer is that we believe that civil disobedience is the best, it\u2019s a far potent weapon than arms, so, that is why they have maintained that position. So, the thing is that, release Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally and dialogue with him. I keep on saying it, what they are doing is mere waste of resources. Everyday you come to the court, security agents, the court staff, all of us will come to the court at the end we go back to our various homes. There is no need for that. The truth remains that a lot of people, a lot of politicians are befitting from what is happening, they want it to continue; they are telling the president, don\u2019t dialogue with IPOB, don\u2019t dialogue with Nnamdi Kanu, that they are in charge, while they are not in charge. It is clear to everybody that the governors of the Southeast are not in charge, the person that is in charge is Nnamdi Kanu. I know a lot of things are going to unfold, but let the government arrest the situation once and for all and that should be done through dialogue.\n\nSit-at-home is a potent weapon as you said, is IPOB taking cognizance of its bandwagon effect on the people?\n\nThat was why I said what I said earlier that I pray government will arrest the situation once and for all. Let them arrest this once and for all. And again, the Southeast governors are not being truthful, I put this to them, they are not being truthful. In 2017, there was a dialogue between Nnamdi Kanu and the Southeast governors and from my little findings, or should I say from my extensive findings, I can categorically tell you that the Presidency is not aware of that particular discussion that was held with Nnamdi Kanu. If the Southeast governors were truthful and told the Presidency what is happening in the Southeast, I believe they will arrest the situation. But because when they go to Abuja, the governors will tell them they\u2019re in charge, nothing is happening, they will destroy the boys, they are divided, give us money, we will do this, we will do that, they are not saying the truth. Nnamdi Kanu is the arrow head, he is the leader, go to the leader and solve this problem. If you want to solve the problem, go to the leader and everything will be over. It is clear to all that someone is in charge of this people and who is that person? The answer is Nnamdi Kanu and anyone telling you otherwise, forget it. Having said that, I will also have to commend some politicians who are making reasonable efforts to get Nnamdi Kanu out from detention and individuals too. I also commend journalists in this country, they are doing wonderful job, they also believe in equity and justice. They want to see things happen transperantly, they know the truth, they want to know what Nnamdi Kanu has done and that was why they were so angry on Thursday when he appeared in court, though they were denied access into the court, but they remained resolute and I commend them for that.\n\nWhen you saw your brother in court, how did you feel?\n\nI was happy to see him as a brother, like I have always said, I would want him to have his doctors examine him. The Federal Government should allow us bring his personal physicians to check him and if possible examine him and see what he\u2019s passing through, it is very, very important. I\u2019m saying this because if anything happens to him where he is, God help us.\n\nWhen you talk about dialogue, in what shape do you think this will take?\n\nNnamdi Kanu is the arrowhead of all this, I am not going to speak on his behalf. When they sit him down, they will look at the issues he has raised, I know they are germaine, look at those issues and treat them, that\u2019s all.\n\nI ask the question because some leaders of the country said the issue of oneness of the nation was settled 51 years ago. Could this be true?\n\nWhatever anybody said, one thing you and I know is that what has remained constant in the face of this earth is change; and change can take place any time, any day. Change could come as a result of the wish of the people and nobody can stop that.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "\u2022Prospects of southern presidential candidate brighten as Ayu emerges national chair\n\n\u2022Party inaugurates new NWC members December 9\n\n\u2022Atiku, Tambuwal, Saraki\u2019s loyalists flood venue with presidential campaign posters\n\nBy Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nWith the successful conduct of a peaceful convention and strong cohesion among its various organs and chieftains, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday kicked off the process of retaking power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe emergence of a former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu as the new National Chairman of the party from the National Convention held yesterday in Abuja, has also brightened the prospects of southern Nigeria to produce the presidential candidate of the party in 2023.\n\nAt the Eagle Square, Abuja venue of the convention, party chieftains such as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Chairman of the party\u2019s convention committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Mr. Ahmadu Fintiri; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; and Chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal spoke glowingly on the party\u2019s chances to retake power in 2023.\n\nThe party affirmed Ayu; the National Secretary, Senator Samuel Daddy Anyanwu, and others as the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who will be inaugurated on December 9 this year.\n\nThe main opposition party will also amend its constitution after the new Electoral Act is signed into law.\n\nChairman of the party\u2019s convention committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Fintiri, who disclosed the affirmation yesterday at the venue of the convention, said the convention was aimed at rescuing Nigeria from the bad governance of the APC.\n\nAyu and Anyanwu were affirmed as national chairman and national secretary following their nomination through consensus.\n\nAyu was nominated by the North-central, while Anyanwu was nominated by the South-east and both candidates were unopposed at the convention.\n\nAs at press time last night, only two offices were being contested for at the convention, as other contestants for the position of National Auditor stepped down for Mr. Sam Ben Nwosu late last night.\n\nThe office of the Deputy National Chairman (South) was being contested by a former national secretary of PDP, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former deputy national chairman of the party in the South-west, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja.\n\nThe office of the Youth Leader was also being contested.\n\nThe zoning committee of the party headed by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State had zoned the office of the national chairman to the North.\n\nTraditionally, when the national chairman emerges from the North, the presidential candidate of the party will emerge from the South and vice versa.\n\nThe emergence of Ayu from the North as the national chairman has raised hopes for a possible emergence of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe development has also brightened the prospects of a southerner succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari as the APC is also favourably disposed to field a southern presidential candidate.\n\nGovernors Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State; Babagana Zulum of Borno State; Darius Ishaku of Taraba State; Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State; Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State \u2013 all elected on the platform of the ruling party, as well as Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State (PDP), among others, had all expressed their preference for power to shift to the South.\n\nHowever, the venue of the PDP convention was flooded with the presidential campaign posters of a former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso; former Vice President Atiku; former Senate President, Saraki; Bauchi State governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; his Sokoto State counterpart, Tambuwal, and former governor of Bauchi State, Adamu Muazu.\n\nMeanwhile, Fintiri said that Ayu and other members of the PDP would be sworn in on December 9 this year, to enable the outgoing NWC members to complete their tenure of four years, having been elected and sworn in on December 9, 2017.\n\nHe said the party is aimed at rescuing Nigeria from the pangs of the maladministration it has been plunged into in the past few years.\n\nFintiri said since the APC was elected in 2015, the testimony of those who jumped into the party\u2019s ship is a telltale of how things have worsened in the land.\n\n\u201cThe political mutation of the party over the years has seen a few of foundational members veering off sometimes. The confessions of most of those who sojourned to any other party in the country are loaded with regrets. Most of them are lucky to stage a comeback and as a magnanimous family, we are always glad to receive them with all privileges, back into our folds.\n\n\u201cFor those, who are still contemplating a return, but are held back by any other force less than Nigeria, I call on you to break the force and return to where you rightly belong. It is time to rescue Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cWe have always been there for Nigeria at its perilous time of need. We are not just a vehicle for winning elections but a symbolism of a free, democratic, and prosperous Nigeria that works for every citizen. We have demonstrated our commitment to these time-tested ideals that Nigerians have every reason to trust us enough more than a contraption that was formed solely to win the election and around the personal ambitions of certain individuals bereft of the knowledge of what to do with the victory,\u201d Fintiri explained.\n\nThe Adawama State governor said Nigerians are yearning for the return of the party, particularly at the centre in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat the people relish those golden moments when the PDP held sway at the centre is not in doubt. That citizens are yearning for the return of PDP at the centre as the 2023 elections draw nearer, is equally not in doubt.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore have a duty not to disappoint our teeming supporters. We have to take back our country as we have always done. We have to save Nigeria. If we could force the country out of the clutches of the military, we can do this one huge task-push the people who don\u2019t know the true definition of good governance and national co-existence out of power.\n\n\u201cThis is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 national convention, presents a starting point for the Nigeria rescue mission,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that 34 candidates indicated interests in various national positions in the party, out of which 28 were cleared, two withdrew voluntarily while four were disqualified.\n\nFintiri said that there were 21 positions to be contested for and a total of 3,600 delegates to elect the officials.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis convention will also not allow us to make and adopt amendments to our constitution. This is because we are foreseeing a need for more amendments after the new Electoral Act passed by the National Assembly is signed into law.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore deferring the votes on constitutional amendments to a special convention to be held on any convenient date to be decided by the NEC.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Senate Minority Leader, Senator. Enyinnaya Abaribe noted that Nigeria was going through difficult moments.\n\nOn his part, the outgoing national secretary of PDP, Senator Umar Tsuari said that the party encountered several challenges during their tenure.\n\nAlso speaking, the acting national chairman of the party, Mr. Yemi Akinwonmi, called on party members to \u201ccome together, bury our personal, individual and collective differences and put PDP and the interest of Nigeria above any consideration.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu described the convention of the party as the engine for a new beginning\n\nHe said Nigerians are yearning for freedom from the suppressive, incompetent, cold-blooded, arrogant, treasury looting and anti-people APC.\n\nWe Have a Chance to Set the Ship Aright, Says Atiku\n\nAddressing the delegates and party officials, former Vice President Atiku charged all Nigerians to take the opportunity presented by the PDP to set Nigeria aright.\n\nHe said that the convention is an opportunity to make decisions that would shape the future of the party for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\nAtiku said Nigeria was passing through the most difficult period of its existence, saying that he is over 70 years and had never seen the country in such a shape.\n\nHe said there was so much insecurity and social tension which were threatening the unity and corporate existence of the country.\n\nPDP is Winning Despite Distractions, Says Tambuwal\n\nAlso speaking at the convention, the Chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Tambuwal expressed optimism that the party is set to reclaim its glory.\n\nAccording to Tambuwal, despite the antics of detractors to roll back the 16 years\u2019 impressive credentials of the party, the party is still at the forefront and endearing.\n\n\u201cAnalysts and observers agreed that there are attempts to scuttle our unity as a party and as a people. People are working to present us as weak and in disarray.\n\n\u201cBut I am happy to report that contrary to the naysayers the PDP is today the strongest and most cohesive party in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am happy to report that those who want to divide and weaken us are the ones failing and we are winning,\u201d Tambuwal told a joyous and tumultuous crowd.\n\nAnyim Declares Interest for 2023 Presidency\n\nMeanwhile, a former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has declared that he will contest for the office of the President in 2023, no matter any zoning arrangement by the PDP.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Abuja yesterday, Anyim noted that his ambition would not be tied to the zoning of the presidency to the South-east by the party.\n\n\u201cWe presently have less than 18 months to the next elections and I feel the time was ripe to indicate my interest.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the zoning committee constituted by the party was only saddled with zoning party positions and not elective positions ahead of 2023.\n\n\u201cZoning of such positions was deferred but nothing stops anyone from the South-east zone from contesting the presidency even if it was not zoned to it,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "In Ordering Investigation, FG Denies Involvement in Raid on Justice Odili\u2019s Residence",
          "text": "\u2022Atiku, NBA, SANs, PANDEF, others seek prosecution of invaders\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday exonerated his ministry from the invasion of the residence of a Supreme Court judge, Justice Mary Odili in Abuja, and ordered a full investigation into the matter.\n\nOver 50 officers suspected operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and members of the Joint Panel Recovery unit of the Federal Ministry of Justice, had in Friday evening, invaded the house of the senior justice located at Imo River Street, Maitama.\n\nThe security officials claimed they were executing a court warrant to search the house.\n\nThe warrant was procured from the Federal Capital Territory Chief Magistrate Court by one CSP Lawrence Ajodo, who claimed to be attached to the Joint Panel Recovery of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nBut Chief Magistrate Emmanuel A. Iyanna had late Friday revoked the order of the court for the search of Odili\u2019s residence, saying the order was based \u201cupon misrepresentation\u201d of facts.\n\nShortly after the invasion was made public, the anti-graft agency through its spokesperson, Mr. Wilson Uwujiaren, denied the involvement of its operatives in the raid.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and some Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) yesterday condemned in strong terms the invasion and called for the investigation and subsequent prosecution of alleged perpetrators.\n\nThe NBA president Mr. Olumide Akpata specifically described the invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s residence as an \u201caffront\u201d on the judiciary.\n\nBut Malami, in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu said he \u201cwas not in any way connected with the fabrications and concocted lies linking him to the ensued imbroglio relating to news stories about the residence of a Justice of the Supreme Court; Justice Mary Odili\u201d.\n\nHe said the clarification to debunk the mischievous publication became imperative given the media hype and the dimension the story is taking.\n\n\u201cIt is important to set the record straight that as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, Malami will not stoop too low to be associated with an apparent in-elegant and nasty court process on the strength of which the purported search warrant was procured\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nAccording to Malami, the media reports on the issue depict a too untidy process that could never emanate from the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\n\u201cThe general public needs to know that there was nothing called Joint Panel Recovery under the Ministry of Justice in the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and by extension the entire Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is Assets Recovery and Management Unit, the mandate of which does not include stings operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister maintained that numerous incongruities in the documents being circulated about the saga revealed traces of criminal actions with particular regards to: \u201cThe name as contained on the purported letter headed paper \u201cGhost\u2019s Account For Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Tax Recovery Panel, the ambiguous reference to Ministry of Justice without clarifying as to whether it is Federal or State Ministry and of which state, the claimed office address which as revealed by the letter headed paper is not the address of the Federal Ministry of Justice and the email address used on the letter.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, all these deductions would have assisted a discerning mind to arrive at a reasonable conclusion of criminal undertones associated with the court process based on which the purported search warrant was procured.\n\nThe statement added that the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice had since reached out to the relevant authorities for an intensified wider investigation on the matter for necessary actions leading to the prosecution of anyone involved in the matter because the only names on record from the process filed in court are a purported police officer who claimed to be \u201cO/C Assets Recovery Team\u201d and one Aliyu Umar, a deponent in the affidavit.\n\n\u201cThe claim of the Chief Magistrate as reported by a section of the media to the effect that he was being misled by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice into the issuance of the search warrant is equally forwarded to the relevant investigative agencies to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the purported association of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and which officer if any in the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is associated with such claimed misrepresentation\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Chief Magistrate, Iyanna, had on Friday night revoked the search warrant, claiming he was misled by the government.\n\nIyanna had issued the search warrant on October 29, 2021, to the Joint Panel Recovery unit of the Federal Ministry of Justice to enable the panel to search Justice Peter-Odili\u2019s home.\n\nOne Lawrence Ajodo, a Chief Superintendent of Police, who was said to be a member of the panel had asked the court for the warrant to investigate alleged illegal activities reported to be taking place in the house by one whistleblower, Aliyu Umar.\n\nThe spokesman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Wilson Uwujaren had on Friday distanced the agency from the invasion and advised members of the public to disregard any news to the contrary.\n\nHowever, reacting to the situation via a statement yesterday, Akpata said the association will hold a meeting with heads of \u201crelevant\u201d security agencies to get more information on the issue.\n\nHe said the fact that the EFCC and Malami have denied their involvement in the operation, \u201csuggests the inference that the residence of the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria was raided by rogue security agencies\u201d.\n\nThe association called on the federal government to ensure that all those responsible for this unfortunate incident are brought to book.\n\nAtiku, Secondus, Kalu Condemn Invasion\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, suspended National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),\n\nPrince Uche Secondus and Chief Whip of the Senate, Chief Orji Kalu, have condemned the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s residence.\n\nA press statement issued by his media office quoted Atiku as saying that a continuation of the notorious behaviour of security operatives conducting a raid on residences of senior judicial officers negates the ideals of a democratic society and is an affront to the independence of the judiciary.\n\nThe statement called for an apology to Justice Mary Odili.\n\nHe also demanded a probe of the circumstances that led to the raid and sanction of those involved.\n\nOn his part, Secondus described the raid as a huge embarrassment and an insult to the judiciary.\n\nHe added that said nothing can explain the embarrassing act of the security operatives on a woman who has put in much in the service of her fatherland.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, Secondus called on the relevant authorities to come clean on what informed such ignoble and dishonourable behaviour and render an unreserved apology to the judge and the judiciary.\n\nSecondus frowned at the frequent harassment of the judiciary by the current administration, pointing out that it does not say good on the country\u2019s democratic credentials and the respect for the doctrine of separation of power.\n\nSimilarly, Kalu described the invasion of the Abuja home of Justice Odili as a cruel, undemocratic, and uncivilised act.\n\nCondemning the raid on justice\u2019s home, he called on the federal government to commence a full-scale investigation into the ugly incident, adding that the unwarranted invasion of the house of the judge was capable of causing tension in the country.\n\nKalu, who is a former governor of Abia State, stressed that in a democratic setup, the rule of law must be strictly adhered to for the sake of national progress and development.\n\nWhile condemning the sad incident, he urged appropriate government agencies to discharge their duties and responsibilities in tandem with the constitution, noting that violation of human rights will set the country backward.\n\nEqually adding its voice to the condemnation, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) in a statement yesterday by its spokesman, Hon Ken Robinson, said the raid, was not only crude and primitive but barbaric and dictatorial.\n\nPANDEF submitted that the raid was another attempt by agents of the Buhari administration to further intimidate and humiliate the nation\u2019s judiciary.\n\nIt said: \u201cAnd this one of such actions too many, against persons of Southern Extraction, particularly, persons from the South-South geopolitical Zone.\n\n\u201cPANDEF DEF recalls that it was in the same nefarious manner that the Abuja residence of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, was invaded in January 2019, which was considered by many as part of political machinations, leading to the 2019 General Elections. Justice Walter Onnoghen was later suspended, made to face a \u201ckangaroo\u201d trial over trumped-up charges, and was forced to retire.\n\n\u201cEarlier, in 2016, the DSS or SSS, in a Gestapo manner, raided the homes of John Okoro and Sylvester Ngwuta, who is now deceased, alongside the residences of Adeniyi Ademola, and Nnamdi Dimgba of the Federal High Court in Abuja\u201d.\n\nPANDEF, therefore, called on all well-meaning and patriotic Nigerians to rise in unison and condemn these atrocious actions against citizens by the federal government and its agents.\n\nIt also called on the International Community, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, not to remain indifferent to the oppressive actions of the Nigerian government against its citizens.\n\nSANs Seek Prosecution of Invaders\n\nOn their part, some of the senior lawyers under the aegis of Concerned Senior Advocates of Nigeria of South-eastern Extraction, in a statement, described the raid as \u201canother frontal attack on the independence and integrity of the judiciary\u201d.\n\nThe concerned SANs expressed worries that the action was part of a series of events aimed at systematically intimidating and emasculating the judiciary.\n\nThe position of the concerned SANs was made known in a statement signed by Professor Ilochi Okafor (SAN); Mr. Etigwe Uwa (SAN) and Mr. Chijioke Okoli (SAN).\n\nWhile recalling similar raids by security operatives on the premises of some Justices of the Supreme Court in 2016, and residence of some Judges of the Federal High Court, in Abuja, they lamented that despite these security agencies publicly stating the raids were on mistaken identity of the premises, no one has been arrested and prosecuted for such brash criminal attack on the judiciary.\n\n\u201cWe re-emphasise that it amounts to an executive infraction on the judicial independence to continue to harass, intimidate and humiliate judges. We want to further reiterate in clear terms that given the constitutionally guaranteed doctrine of the independence of the judiciary, no security agency or prosecuting authority in Nigeria has the power to investigate, arrest, or prosecute a sitting judicial officer without first referring the matter to the National Judicial Council, and await the directive of the council.\n\n\u201cWe call on the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to immediately direct investigation of all security agents and other persons who played any role in this assault on the judiciary and any persons found culpable should be made to face the full wrath of the law\u201d, they said.\n\nOn his part, senior lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), said the invasion could be politically-motivated to embarrass her.\n\nOzekhome, who visited Odili\u2019s house after the incident, said the raid could make Nigeria a laughing stock in the international community.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t resist any search. I believe that they would have found that they were committing terrible hara-kiri, that is, giving them the benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe other theory which is also as powerful is that it was politically-motivated, deliberately contrived as artifice and designed to embarrass this cerebral justice of the Supreme Court and to embarrass her husband.\n\n\u201cBut whatever theory, one thing is clear to me, we are gradually moving towards the precipice of calling ourselves a banana republic,\u201d Ozekhome said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Oyinlola loses deputy national chair (south) contest to Arapaja\n\nBy Nseobong Okon-Ekong\n\nThe newly elected National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, has given a quit notice to the ruling All Progressives Congress, saying \u201cwe are taking back the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the early hours of Sunday after his election at the national convention of the party in Abuja, Ayu said: \u201cThe PDP is back. We are determined. The other one is a contraption.\n\n\u201cIn two weeks time you will see the power that will come back in PDP in every state. A small group of people decided to divide Nigeria. We will unite the country and move ahead to develop this country.\n\n\u201cWe did it before, we will do it again. The other party can never hold a convention\u2026 It is a challenge. This is a quit notice to the other party. We are taking back the country.

          "text": "A former Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts, Rear Admiral Tahir Yusuf (retd.), on the wanted list of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has sneaked back into the country using an illegally obtained international passport, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nThe EFCC had accused Yusuf of stealing N2billion belonging to the Nigerian government while serving as Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts.\n\nIn 2020, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the permanent forfeiture of about N500 million found to be fraudulently amassed by the military officer to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe total amount forfeited was N392,695,857.87, including $91,955.38 and the sum of \u00a315,050 held in domiciliary accounts.\n\nYusuf, previously second-in-command to the Chief of Account and Budget, Naval Headquarters (NHQ), held the cash in seven accounts- both private and corporate in two banks.\n\nThe seven accounts were operated under the name of a company, Bitmas Enterprise, in Zenith Bank while two were held in Yusuf\u2019s name in the defunct Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nFollowing the forfeiture, SaharaReporters gathered that Yusuf fled Nigeria to Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe EFCC and National Intelligence Agency also asked the Nigeria Immigration Service and Interpol to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit.\n\nHowever, Yusuf sneaked back to the country in October after he illegally obtained an international passport with the help of some corrupt government officials through Niger Republic, a source told SaharaReporters. See Also CRIME Ex-Naval Director On Wanted List For Corruption Sneaks Back Into Nigeria, Assaults Woman With Military Protection\n\nThe source added that the fugitive had been moving round the country with military guards provided by the Navy authorities.\n\n\u201cThe Admiral ran to Dubai about 4 years back. Before then, the EFCC and NIA had asked the Nigerian Immigration to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit. Interpol too,\u201d the source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWhile he managed to escape abroad with his connections and deep pocket, his passport expired while in Dubai. Now because of the restriction on his passport, he couldn't renew it. He went to the Nigerian Embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE and wanted to bribe his way to getting his passport renewed. After realising who he was, and the restrictions, they refused. He now used some contacts in Nigeria to have a fake passport done for him and sent to him to Dubai. This is what he used to renew his residency in Dubai and it is the same fake passport he used to move out of Dubai, to Niger Republic and then Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is the fake passport. He claimed to have renewed it in Abu Dhabi. But all passports renewed in Abu Dhabi carry only one passport number. This means he renewed his here in Nigeria. And last two months, the new passport number was checked and it wasn't on the data base of the immigration. And how can he have renewed it here when he was in Dubai at the time? He has insiders in the Immigration and they have been looking for a way to put him on the data base.\n\n\u201cIn Abu Dhabi, once you show your old passport and they confirm it, they issue you with a new one and only your new passport number will be on the passport, unlike his that carries old passport number and new passport number. So he had it renewed illegally in Nigeria and it was sent to him over there.\n\n\u201cHe entered Nigeria through Niger republic and has been moving with military driver and orderly.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts, Rear Admiral Tahir Yusuf (retd.), on the wanted list of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has sneaked back into the country using an illegally obtained international passport, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nThe EFCC had accused Yusuf of stealing N2billion belonging to the Nigerian government while serving as Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts.\n\nIn 2020, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the permanent forfeiture of about N500 million found to be fraudulently amassed by the military officer to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe total amount forfeited was N392,695,857.87, including $91,955.38 and the sum of \u00a315,050 held in domiciliary accounts.\n\nYusuf, previously second-in-command to the Chief of Account and Budget, Naval Headquarters (NHQ), held the cash in seven accounts- both private and corporate in two banks.\n\nThe seven accounts were operated under the name of a company, Bitmas Enterprise, in Zenith Bank while two were held in Yusuf\u2019s name in the defunct Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nFollowing the forfeiture, SaharaReporters gathered that Yusuf fled Nigeria to Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe EFCC and National Intelligence Agency also asked the Nigeria Immigration Service and Interpol to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit.\n\nHowever, Yusuf sneaked back to the country in October after he illegally obtained an international passport with the help of some corrupt government officials through Niger Republic, a source told SaharaReporters. See Also CRIME Ex-Naval Director On Wanted List For Corruption Sneaks Back Into Nigeria, Assaults Woman With Military Protection\n\nThe source added that the fugitive had been moving round the country with military guards provided by the Navy authorities.\n\n\u201cThe Admiral ran to Dubai about 4 years back. Before then, the EFCC and NIA had asked the Nigerian Immigration to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit. Interpol too,\u201d the source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWhile he managed to escape abroad with his connections and deep pocket, his passport expired while in Dubai. Now because of the restriction on his passport, he couldn't renew it. He went to the Nigerian Embassy in Abu Dhabi, UAE and wanted to bribe his way to getting his passport renewed. After realising who he was, and the restrictions, they refused. He now used some contacts in Nigeria to have a fake passport done for him and sent to him to Dubai. This is what he used to renew his residency in Dubai and it is the same fake passport he used to move out of Dubai, to Niger Republic and then Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is the fake passport. He claimed to have renewed it in Abu Dhabi. But all passports renewed in Abu Dhabi carry only one passport number. This means he renewed his here in Nigeria. And last two months, the new passport number was checked and it wasn't on the data base of the immigration. And how can he have renewed it here when he was in Dubai at the time? He has insiders in the Immigration and they have been looking for a way to put him on the data base.\n\n\u201cIn Abu Dhabi, once you show your old passport and they confirm it, they issue you with a new one and only your new passport number will be on the passport, unlike his that carries old passport number and new passport number. So he had it renewed illegally in Nigeria and it was sent to him over there.\n\n\u201cHe entered Nigeria through Niger republic and has been moving with military driver and orderly.\u201d",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions.

Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone. Image: Screenshot from \u2018How KaiOS Is Becoming the 3rd Major Mobile OS\u2019.\n\naYo Holdings, a micro-insurance joint venture between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH), announced yesterday, Thursday, October 28th, 2021, that it will be transforming its technology backend and data management approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means aYo will be modifying its business model.\n\nWhy? The company plans to drive greater scale, better customer experience, and faster access to markets across the African continent in the coming years.\n\nWhy should you care? Launched in 2017, aYo offers hospital and life cover in Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Do you think SIM card registration combats crime or increases surveillance in Africa?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nLiving Below Your Means: The First Step to Wealth.

Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

          "title": "Nigerians groaning under galloping staple food prices",
          "text": "Less than two years to the next round of the Nigerian general election, citizens are lamenting intense pressure of poverty and high cost of living.\n\nSix years after a change of government, promises of a better life for the people have remained a pipe dream. Instead of a respite, the country is being mired in socio-economic quagmire to the chagrin of the electorate.\n\nPrices of staple foods have quadrupled in the last 6 years, forcing many families to review their lifestyles.\n\nMany more families are relocating to the village from the cities over the worsening state of the economy.\n\nBrain drain is also on the rise, occasioned by the rising level of unemployment and poverty in the country.\n\nThe country\u2019s food production has taken a hit with the unchecked attacks by herdsmen across the country, which has frustrated agricultural activities.\n\nWith the ever-increasing inflation rate, which has impacted every aspect of the economy, amid daily increase of prices of products and services, and even social life, the average Nigerian family is experiencing real bad times.\n\nRead Also: Rising food prices threaten Nigeria\u2019s economic recovery -IMF\n\nNigeria\u2019s food prices\n\nThe worst still is the hyper increase in food prices, which is making \u2018one square meal a day\u2019 difficult, and many who cannot afford it, starving today.\n\nAs of September 2021, Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate is 16.63 percent, while the cost of food increased 19.57 percent in the same month, according to data from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nGenerally, food items have more than doubled in their prices between March and September this year and are likely going to increase again for the festive season sales.\n\nFrom N40 in March, a fresh egg goes for N80 now; a paint of garri from N600 to N1,200 today, the popular sachet water from N10 to N20.\n\nBusinessDaySUNDAY market survey shows that 50kg bag of foreign and local rice, which formerly sold for N12,000 and N10,000 few years back now sells for N30,000 and N27,000 respectively.\n\nAlso, 25kg bag of foreign and local rice, sold for N6,000 and N5,000 now sell for N15,000 andN13,500. A paint bucket and derica of foreign rice sell for N2,500 and N500 while local rice sell for N2,300 and N400 respectively.\n\nA bag of beans which even until last year was sold for N9,000 now sells for between N42,500 and N35,000; one paint bucket of beans, which was formerly sold for between N1,250 and N1,300 now sell for N3,300 while one derica that was sold for N250 now goes for N650.\n\nA pack of spaghetti which was formerly sold for N3,000 now goes for N7,000 while one that was formerly sold for N150 now goes for N350.\n\nMeanwhile, 20 litres of vegetable oil now goes for a minimum of N28, 000; 10 litres sell for N18,500 while 5 litres sell for between N6500 and N9,000.\n\nFor red oil, 20 litres now sell for about N15,000 now goes for N25,500 while 10 litres that was formerly N7,500 now sells for N12,750.\n\nA carton of frozen chicken popularly called \u2018Orobo chicken\u2019 which was formerly sold for about N9,500 from the cool room, now goes for N16,600 while a kilo goes for about N2,000.\n\nA carton of ordinary frozen chicken goes for N15, 000 while a kilo is sold for about N1,800. A carton of frozen turkey which was formerly sold for N11,500 or N12,500 now goes for N17,000 or N18,500 depending on the location.\n\nBringing the situation home, Chuma Ofili, an economist and tax expert, draws a mental analysis of the situation, with his driver who has withdrawn his two children from two schools in one term because he couldn\u2019t afford the almost double increase in the fees by the schools, and his barber, who has increased his charges from N300 to N500 and N600 depending on the source of electricity he is using.\n\n\u201cMy driver complained that his wife is asking for more money for upkeep as prices of food items have increased, hence has asked for an increase in salary, which I cannot afford now. My barber has moved into another shop because the owner increased the rent by 200 percent and a food vendor in the new shop has also increased her plate of rice and one small meat to N700, as well, the popular indomie noodle by the Aboki is no longer cheap. They all blame their increments on the increasing costs in the market\u201d, Ofili says, decrying further that the increase in prices are across both imported and food items produced here.\n\nAccording to Ofili, who trained in the United States of America and maintains a home in Atlanta, globally, food prices are going up since 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which many are still struggling to recover from.\n\nBut he regrets that food prices are skyrocketing in Nigeria at an alarming rate every day, putting huge pressure on families no matter their size.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in the United States, food prices are up 3.7 percent in 2021, as against a 20-year average of about 2.4 percent. The country was able to achieve that because of its huge food production capacity, policies and price controls to avert unnecessary inflation. But Nigeria does not have these measures in place, hence the hyper inflation, which is at the detriment of poor families\u201d, he explains.\n\nObservers have also lamented that the poor are really on the edge now because of the hardship they face, amid increasing food prices.\n\nAliyu Wabba, president, Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), is also crying out for workers, noting that the N30,000 minimum wage, which was passed into law in 2019 by president Muhammadu Buhari has been reduced to nothing by inflation.\n\n\u201cToday we know that the N30,000 minimum wage has been reduced to virtually nothing due to external effects of inflation in our system\u201d, the NLC president said at an event marking the 2021 World Day for Decent Work in Abuja.\n\nHowever, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is insisting that inflation is declining.\n\nThe NBS revealed that Nigeria maintained an inflation decline for about seven months, due to the introduction of policies by the government, which impacted positively on most commodities.\n\nExpressing concern over the poor state of affairs in the country, Olisa Agbakoba, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said: \u201cThe main thing that agitates me is the transition to a presidential democracy in 2023 vis-\u00e0-vis what is now indices of great suffering. There is a sort of disconnect in our political parties both in APC and PDP being the major ones. When one hears them talk, it is as if they forget they will come to us to for vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe main thing is with the Nigeria\u2019s dwindling financial resources. If I am to speak for Nigerians, I think what they would want to hear is exactly how either of these political parties will address poverty, create jobs, create healthcare opportunity and revamp the economy. Those are the critical things and I think that is the main concern that one has. It\u2019s to do with the fact that neither of the political parties has an ideology. You find the politicians jumping from one party to the other. What concerns them is mainly the issue of how do I get power.\u201d\n\nAgbakoba, who also ruled out the possibility of going into partisan politics in 2023, said: \u201cPoliticians should focus their attention on us rather than themselves. It is such a charade and it puts me off when I watch them on television and I say to myself, does these guys know that we are watching them? There is no connection at all. Why will a reasonable Nigerian be interested in what they are saying? He is not hearing anything that will make his life better. These are my critical concerns.\u201d\n\nSimon Harry, Statistician-General of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), attributed the sustained decline in inflation to the Federal Government\u2019s policies, which he said, reflected in the improved consumer price index.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently maintained a decline for about seven months and the reason for that is some of the policies put in place by the government are impacting positively on most of the commodities that make up the basket for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), \u201d Harry explained.\n\nBut economy observers are wondering how NBS came about the declining inflation data going by the continued increase in prices of goods, services and especially food items across the country.\n\nOnyedi Ifeatu, a senior lecturer at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, noted that price increase has been sustained in the seven months NBS said inflation declined, while more price increment is expected as the market is getting ready for festive season sales.\n\n\u201cWe need to go out there to feel the pulse of the poor. Things are very expensive, families are really suffering and one square meal is becoming impossible today, so why is NBS talking about decline when it is obvious inflation is rising uncontrollably\u201d, Ifeatu said.\n\nFor Chijioke .J. Umelahi, an Abuja-based lawyer and former Abia State lawmaker, the decline report by NBS is politically motivated to caress the government and to secure their appointments.\n\n\u201cWe should be talking about how to address the issues that are pushing inflation up and not saying it is declining when the government has not done anything in that regard. NBS said government policies are helping to reduce inflation, which policies and how have they reduced inflation when garri and sachet water are no longer common and out of the reach of the common man\u201d, Umelahi said.\n\nLooking at the situation from another perspective, Jeremiah Agada, an agronomist at the Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, noted that if Nigerian had improved and sustained achievements in its food production, there would have been reasonable supply to ensure sufficiency, reduce cost and pressure on importation, as well as cost of food in the market.\n\nBut he decried that some of the achievements were eroded by the activities of killer herdsmen, who killed and sacked many farmers from the farms, which is impacting negatively on food security in the country.\n\n\u201cBenue is known for large scale food production, but that is no longer possible as the killer herdsmen have killed many of the farmers, their families are crying for justice and the government does not care,\u201d he said.\n\nAgada blamed the increasing cost of food items on the less farming activities by farmers and, mostly on government\u2019s lip service in the fight against insecurity, especially killer herdsmen.",

          "title": "COP26: Success for Africa is holding rich nations to their climate finance pledges",
          "text": "Rich countries committed to mobilizing $100billion yearly in long-term financing under the Paris Agreement as part of their historical responsibility for climate change but they are not meeting up and experts say Africa should demand accountability.\n\nTherefore the African delegation to COP 26 have been urged not to be quick to give away the house unless they extract commitments from rich countries who bear more responsibility for climate change to pay a fair share towards efforts to combat its impacts.\n\nThe Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), an environment non-profit called on African governments to be resolute in their demand for climate change liability and payments for carbon debts by rich countries.\n\nGodwin Uyi Ojo, executive director, ERA/FoEN said the pledge to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020-2025 as funds to address climate change actions stands at about 30 percent, and is nowhere near what is needed to address the change.\n\n\u201cAfrican delegates should ensure to speak with one voice to demand transitional justice in the payment of carbon debts currently put at 334 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.\n\nOjo, citing a 2015 study published in Nature Climate Change, in which Concordia University researcher Damon Matthews showed how national carbon and climate debts could be used to decide who should pay for the global costs of climate mitigation and damages, the world\u2019s leading polluters have racked up a $10 trillion carbon debt for carbon dioxide emissions since 1990.\n\n\u201cThis demand for carbon debt payment is sacrosanct and does not deflect from the US$100 billion commitment for climate actions,\u201d Ojo said.\n\nRead Also: COP26 Climate Change: Developed countries to mobilise $100bn yearly\n\nCOP26\n\nHow rich countries can meet their commitments\n\nThe governments of Canada and Germany have published a \u2018Delivery Plan,\u2019 commissioned by the incoming COP26 President, that outlines how developed countries plan to meet their joint commitment of mobilizing $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries annually from 2020 to 2025 even as it confirms that rich countries have not always met their climate finance commitments.\n\n\u201cThough developed countries pledged twelve years ago to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance annually by 2020, the \u2018Delivery Plan\u2019 confirms it is unlikely that they delivered the requisite contributions last year,\u201d said Lorena Gonzalez, senior associate in the WRI Finance Center.\n\nGonzalez said developing countries need finance now so that they can invest in climate action to shift their economies\u2019 long-term trajectory, as well as deal with mounting climate impacts.\n\nAccording to the report, based on recent estimates from the OECD, climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries increased from US$58.5 billion in 2016 to US$79.6 billion in 2019.\n\nThis represents an overall increase since committing to the US$100 billion goal in 2009, when collective climate finance, reached US$30 billion for the period 2010\u20132012.\n\nThe plan said that based on the latest data, a more than US$20 billion annual increase would be required to meet the US$100 billion goal in2020. While it will not be known until 2022 whether the US$100 billion goal has been met in 2020, recent trends show that it apears unlikely.\n\nOne way to raise this funding, according to the report, is for rich countries to increasing the scale of climate finance and increase finance for adaptation. Article 9.4 of the Paris Agreement states that the provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation.\n\nRich countries are also urged to prioritise grant-based finance for the poorest and most vulnerable whose situation has become complicated by the ravages of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cDeveloped countries will hence prioritize grant-based resources, as part of a wide variety of financial instruments, to ensure there are adequate financial tools at the project level,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report also suggested addressing barriers in accessing climate finance, strengthening the Financial Mechanism of UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, working with Multilateral Development Banks to increase and improve climate finance better manage private finance and report on collective progress transparently.\n\nAnalysts say Africa, least responsible for, and yet most vulnerable to climate change, cannot afford to be complacent on the need for strong negotiating positions and astute diplomacy in order to get good outcomes from the UN meeting.\n\n\u201cOf the many negotiation issues that concern Africa, climate finance has to be among the priorities,\u201d said Chukwumerije Okereke, director, Center for Climate Change and Development, a think-tank out of the Alex-Ekwueme Federal University.\n\nAt the recent 76th UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, rich nations pledged to commit funds towards climate financing. For example, US President Joe Biden doubled the US Government climate finance pledge from $5.7bn to $11.4bn per year by 2024 though this is now up in the air with the uncertain negotiations at the Capitol.\n\nUK prime minister Boris Johnson pledged 11.1 billion pounds and Japan said it will provide climate finance, both public and private, to developing countries including small island states, totalling approximately $60 billion over the next five years from 2021 to 2025.\n\n\u201cWhile these new financial pledges are commendable, it is important that African leaders are not na\u00efve or ignorant about a host of outstanding issues on climate finance in COP26,\u201d Okereke said.\n\nThe scholar in an op ed said African leaders must know that the $100 billion pledged by rich countries is insufficient in comparison to what climate change is costing and will cost developing countries, so African governments must get rich countries that are responsible for climate change to increase their pledges in COP26.\n\nOkereke also said African governments must ensure that rich countries will provide new and additional financing to the existing Overseas Development Assistance and not conflate the two and must argue for energy security for Africa whose being railroaded to abandon its gas resources in the midst of energy poverty.\n\n\u201cWe cannot expect African nations, which together emitted seven times less CO2 than China last year and four times less than the US, according to the Global Carbon Atlas, to undermine their best opportunities for economic development by simply aligning with the Western view of how to tackle carbon emissions,\u201d said Nj Ayuk, executive chairman, African Energy Chamber, an energy think at the launch of the International Energy Association Net-Zero target earlier this year.\n\nThe \u2018Delivery Plan,\u2019 developed under the leadership of Minister Wilkinson from Canada and State Secretary Flasbarth from Germany, could be a key step toward ensuring developed countries rapidly scale up climate finance. Developing countries deserve to see a clear, credible and robust plan for realizing the pledge, analysts say.\n\nWhile the Delivery Plan is said to be an important start, especially in outlining a path to achieving an average of $100 billion per year for the period 2021-2025, but it does not address the likely shortfall from 2020.\n\nBuilding on this, developed countries and multilateral development banks need to ramp up commitments so that the $100 billion per year goal can be met before the expected 2023 date. They should also recognize that the $100 billion is a floor and not a ceiling, the document said.\n\nMost developed countries have not yet mobilized finance in accordance with their fair share. The United States is responsible for the greatest shortfall, and Australia, Canada, Italy, Greece, Iceland, and Portugal, among others, would need to do more.\n\nThe plan called on developed countries to continue to work toward a robust and credible collective strategy to deliver on this long-standing commitment as soon as possible, making up for any shortfalls\u2014including those from 2020\u2014and strengthening reporting and adaptation finance.\n\n\u201cAs a pillar of the Paris Agreement, much stands on climate finance. The stronger this pillar, the stronger the Agreement and the faster and farther we can move toward rapid decarbonization and enhanced adaptation and resilience that will save lives and promote human livelihood around the world,\u201d the document said.\n\nClimate financing will be a critical issue at COP 26 and the annual $100 billion goal born at the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, formalized in Cancun in 2010 and affirmed as part of the Paris pact will take center stage. Failure to make progress on this goal would undermine much-needed trust in the Paris Agreement.",

It is a significant contributor to our economic development, and so for Nigeria to become part of the league of countries with strong economies, it must have a well-developed capital market.\u201d\n\nThe governor further charged the stockbrokers to do everything within their powers to eliminate barriers, which have been inhibiting the development of the nation\u2019s capital market over the last decade.\n\n...",

Seven of the victims were security officials while the remaining were civilians.\n\nThe security operatives included three police officers, two operatives of theand one Customs official.\n\nThe total tally of casualties for the week (October 24-30) was compiled by PREMIUM TIMES from media reports. Thus, unreported cases were not included.\n\nAlthough the 40 people reported killed last week is lower than the 47 killed in the previous week, the number of incidents was higher last week.\n\nHere are the cases compiled from media reports last week.\n\nSouth-east\n\nGunmen in the early hours of Sunday attacked the police divisional headquarters at Unwana, Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State and killed three police personnel on duty.\n\nAccording to the report, the gunmen attacked the division at about 2 a.m. and killed one constable and two inspectors.\n\nAlso in the South-east, some gunmen on Friday attacked operatives of the State Security Services (SSS) in Anambra State, killing two personnel.\n\nThe officers were said to have been ambushed by the armed persons while on an election campaign duty in the Ekwulobia area of the state.\n\nAnother personnel of one of the security agencies also lost his life when troops of the 82 Division of the Nigerian Army had an encounter in Anambra State with IPOB/ESN separatists.\n\nNorth-central\n\nArmed persons attacked a mosque in Maza-Kuka village in Mashegu Local Government Area of Niger State, killing 18 worshipers.\n\nIt was gathered that the armed persons invaded the village in large numbers and attacked the villagers, who were performing their early morning prayers on Monday.\n\nIn neighbouring Kogi State, six persons were killed while some houses were burnt by armed persons in a Monday morning attack on the Bagana community of Omala Local Government Area of Kogi.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in Kogi, Idrisu Dabban, confirmed the incident to reporters after a visit to the area.\n\nNorth-west\n\nAt least six people were reportedly killed while several others were abducted after bandits on Sunday evening raided Unguwar Samanja village in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State.\n\nAlso in Katsina, a large group of bandits on Thursday attacked Dangeza, a farming and business community in Batsari Local Government Area and killed five residents.\n\nSouth-west\n\nSuspected smugglers killed an officer of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) in Fagbohun village, Yewa South Local Government Area, Ogun State.\n\nThe smugglers attacked a patrol team of customs officers from the Federal Operating Unit (FOU) who had arrived in the village for an operation.\n\nTwo other officers were reported missing after the attack.\n\nEfforts ongoing to tackle insecurity\n\nSpeaking on the security situation Thursday in Abuja, the police chief, Mr Alkali, said the police are making efforts to address the situation.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force is however unrelenting in rejigging its public safety strategies to adequately contain prevailing and emerging crime trends across the country.\u201d\n\nMr Alkali said that \u201cthe strong collaboration between the police, armed forces and other security agencies\u201d led to what he described as \u201cthe improved security situation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me state categorically that the new spirit of collaboration between the Nigeria Police, the Nigeria Armed Forces, the Department of State Services and other security and intelligence agencies in the country has indeed spurred a common front in reducing crime and criminality nationwide,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and suspended National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, have joined other well meaning Nigerians and organisations to condemn the invasion of the residence of Justice Mary Odili, a Supreme Court judge, by security operatives on Friday night.\n\nA team of police officers, said to be operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and soldiers late Friday, invaded Justice Odili\u2019s official residence at Maitama, Abuja, brandishing a search warrant issued by Emmanuel Iyanna, a chief magistrate at Wuse Zone 6 Magistrate Court, which has since been withdrawn.\n\nReacting to the development, the NBA in a statement on Saturday by its president, Olamide Apata, said it \u201creceived with grave concern the news of the unlawful siege on the Abuja residence of a Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Honourable Justice Mary Ukaego Peter-Odili, last night by officers of one or more of the Nigerian security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe NBA regretted that, \u201cAlmost 24 hours later, information concerning the basis of the siege remains hazy and the subject of speculation, apart from reports that the invasion was pursuant to a search warrant issued by a Magistrate Court in Abuja, which search warrant has now been revoked.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation under whose office the team that purportedly carried out the raid is allegedly domiciled has also denounced the team, which suggests the inference that the residence of the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria was raided by rogue security agencies. The grave implications of this possibility leave a lot to be desired.\n\n\u201cWhen viewed in the context of a similar raid on the premises of Supreme Court Justices in 2016, the rationale of which was never fully explained or indeed justified, the NBA interprets last night\u2019s incident as a part of an orchestrated affront on the Judiciary, designed to intimidate and ridicule the Judiciary. The NBA will no longer allow this to continue.\n\n\u201cIn case the law enforcement agencies have not learnt their lessons, events like this do nothing but erode the independence of sacred democratic institutions like the Judiciary, undermine the rule of law in Nigeria, and set the country back in the quest to instil confidence in citizens of Nigeria, Nigerian businesses, and foreign investors that Nigeria operates a democracy with an independent Judiciary.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with My Lord, Peter-Odili JSC and I am happy to report that she is alive and well. Beyond that however, it is my pledge to Nigerians that the NBA will get to the root of this matter.\u201d\n\nApata emphasized that the invasion was an affront on the judiciary, noting that the association will convene an emergency meeting to discuss it.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, last night\u2019s event is an affront on the Judiciary and grossly undermines the democracy that we profess to practise. In line with the aims and objectives of the NBA which include the protection and defence of the independence of the Judiciary and the Rule of Law in Nigeria, we will be convening an emergency meeting of the NBA National Executive Committee solely to discuss this issue and take a definitive stand on behalf of the NBA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI will also lead a delegation to the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN and the relevant heads of security agencies to seek further clarification on the circumstances of this incident. Thereafter, the NBA will ensure that all those responsible for this unfortunate incident are brought to book. We must do all that is required to safeguard the independence of our Judiciary and indeed protect our hard-won democracy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Secondus in a statement by Ike Abonyi, his SA Media, described the invasion as an embarrassment to the nation, \u201cand an insult on the judiciary the search carried out in the home of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court Of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said, \u201cPrince Secondus said that nothing can explain the embarrassing act of the security operatives on a woman who has put in much in the service of her fatherland.\n\n\u201cHe said that relevant authorities should come clean on what informed such ignoble and dishonourable behavior and render unreserved apology to the Justice and the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility as a democratic nation to ensure the continued sanctity of the judiciary as a critical component of democracy.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus frowned at the frequent harassment of the judiciary by this administration pointing out that it does not tell well on our democratic credentials and the respect for the doctrine of separation of power.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus also noted that the development calls for more diligence on the part of judicial officers in responding to search warrant requests from overzealous officials of the executive.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army on Saturday, said the violent attacks carried out by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the country\u2019s Southeast, has betrayed their heinous and directionless agenda for Igbo people, hence their loss of popularity in the region.\n\nThe Army which was refuting an allegation by a certain Kalu Odinakachi, that it has a hand in the attacks by unknown gunmen in the region, noted in a statement by its spokesman, Brig. General Onyema Nwachukwu, that the suggestion was baseless, unfounded and could be absolutely described as a hoax.\n\nIt said the proscribed separatist group has in recent times foisted a sit-at-home order to show sympathy for their self acclaimed leader, which was greeted with violence, orchestrated destruction of public installations and facilities, arson, as well as looting of shops and malls in the region, to demonstrate their criminal potency.\n\nThe army suggested that following a backlash from the people over attacks by the group, its propagandists are trying to blame soldiers for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army(NA) is not unmindful of the antics of individuals or group, whose stock in trade is to peddle falsehood and disinformation to remain relevant in South East Nigeria. One of such scheming. currently in the media domain is the mischievous submission by Kalu Odinakachi, who alleged that the DMI and DSS created and funded BNG, UGM to Enforce-Sit-at Home in a bid to discredit IPOB/ESN. It must be be abundantly clarified that this spurious allegation is unfounded and could be absolutely described as a hoax,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThough the NA would not like to elevate such purveyors of disinformation and propaganda, it is expedient to put on record, that in recent times, the activities of IPOB/ESN have undoubtedly assumed a violent dimension. This unimaginable level of violence is olled with propaganda and disinformation to whip up sentiments and draw sympathy from unsuspecting citizens in the region.\n\n\u201cFor the records, the proscribed organization has in recent times foisted a sit-at-home order to show sympathy for their self acclaimed leader. This was greeted with violence, orchestrated destruction of public installations and facilities, arson, as well as looting of shops and malls in the region, to demonstrate their criminal potency. They defiled the sanctity of the highly revered traditional institution of Ndigbos by recklessly murdering their own traditional leaders. These spineless and irresponsible actions targeted at the very people they claim they want to liberate, clearly unmask their heinous and direction less agenda for Ndigbos.\n\n\u201cRealising the futility, hollowness and public rejection of their violent agitation, they resorted to twisting the narrative in the region to galvanize local support. Their wild allegation that BNG and UGN were an overt operation by the DMI and DSS is not only laughable, but remains largely illusive and a ploy to diminish the public support the NA is savouring in the ongoing exercises. In his blatant display of ignorance, Odinakachi failed to realize that such designation as DMI has since ceased to exist in the NA. These criminal elements with their cohorts must come to terms with the reality of the ongoing Exercise GOLDEN DAWN and turn themselves in to security agencies or be ready to face the consequences of their lawlessness.\n\n\u201cMore grotesque is the narrative peddled by these merchants of propaganda, in respect of IPOB/ESN gunmen recently eliminated by troops in a shootout at Ekwulobia Roundout in Aguata LGA. These unscrupulous elements insinuated that those taken out were Fulanis. An outrageous claim that should be disregarded in its entirety. This is apparently another failed attempt in their usual mannerism, to attribute their criminal activities to a third party and feign innocence; an indication of a visionless group totally devoid of integrity.\n\n\u201cThe NA wishes to reassure the good people of the South East to go about their normal businesses, as efforts are stepped up to rid the region of criminal elements masquarading as BNG and UGM. We encourage members of the public to provide actionable information to security agencies as the Exercises progress.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "text": "A former deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, has called on the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to resign over what he called his embarrassing and selective targeting of judicial officers from the South.\n\nHe condemned in strong terms the illegal invasion of the house of the second most senior Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili, by security operatives allegedly at the behest of the Malami-led Ministry of Justice.\n\nHe said despite Malami\u2019s rash denial of his involvement in the shameful saga, \u201che (Malami) cannot entirely distance himself from the sting operation in view of previous state sponsored impunity against selected Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Federal High Court, under his watch.\u201d\n\nFrank, who is the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), Ambassador to East Africa and Middle East, in a statement in Abuja, also called on the President Muhammdu Buhari to immediately relieve Malami of his job should he fail to heed the call to vacate the office of AGF.\n\nHe said the need to replace Malami has become imperative to stop incessant harassment, intimidation and molestation of judicial officers as well as the denigration and desecration of the judiciary by Malami and security agencies acting on his orders.\n\nHe alleged that Malami has continued to clandestinely promote acts of terror and impunity against Judicial Officers in the country in an attempt to cow them and render the judiciary subservient to the executive arm of government.\n\nHe recalled the attack against Justices and Judges in 2016, when operatives of the Department of State Services forcefully invaded and raided the residences of some Justices and judges under the cover of night.\n\nHe insisted that the manifest impunity against the justices under Malami\u2019s watch was followed by the unceremonious removal of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen who is from the South, by the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress\u2019 (APC) regime barely 29 days to the 2019 general elections.\n\nHe lampooned attempts by Malami to sweep the recent violation of Justice Odili\u2019s house under the carpet by saying he has ordered a\n\nprobe into the sickening and anti-democratic action of security operatives against a respected Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWhat is the result of past inquiries ordered by Malami when the residences of selected Supreme Court Justices and Federal High Court judges were invaded in a gestapo-style by the DSS in 2016?\u201d he asked.\n\nRecall that Justices whose houses were raided by the DSS and EFCC in search of phantom incriminating evidence in 2016 include Sylvester Ngwuta and John Okoro of the Supreme Court and Adeniyi Ademola, and Nnamdi Dimgba of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nOthers include a judge of the Kano High Court, Kabiru Auta, Chief Judge of Enugu State, A. I. Umezulike and Gombe State judge, Muazu Pindiga.\n\nThe residences of Justice Samia of the Sokoto state High Court and Justice Mohammed Liman in Port Harcourt were also raided.\n\nHe said it is curious that both Malami, EFCC and DSS have denied complicity in the recent target witch-hunt against Justice Odili, while the police whose operatives carried out the action have refused to either deny or own up to their nefarious misadventure.\n\nHe wondered why Malami and has continued his devious mission of \u201cselective targeting\u201d of Southerners in the top echelon of the judiciary.\n\nIt was Justice Onnoghen yesterday, today it is Justice Odili, who is the next judicial officer that will fall to Malami\u2019s hammer of politically motivated impunity.\n\nHe insisted that Malami must be held accountable for the current invasion and any future harm against Justice Odili, \u201cwho the hawks in the Buhari\u2019s regime are eager to remove from office to prevent her from succeeding the incumbent CJN, Justice Tanko Muhammad simply because of her geopolitical linage.\n\n\u201cThey have a clandestine motive to remove the fearless jurist because she is the next in line to succeed the incumbent CJN. It is a strategy to remove her on time ahead of the 2023 general elections knowing fully well that she cannot be bought of pocketed by the APC\u2019s regime,\u201d Frank declared.\n\nHe called on the International Community to restrain Malami from attending or participating in any international fora on judiciary and legal matters over his attempt to subjugate and ultimately destroy the Nigerian judiciary.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nConflicting Reports As Security Operatives Lay Siege To Justice Mary Odili\u2019s Residence\n\nHe also called on the Secretary of Justice of the United States and the U.S. Government to place a visa ban on Malami over his continuous attacks against judicial officers and judiciary in Nigeria in order to pacify, weaken and escalate them ahead of APC\u2019s planned rigging of the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe urged the National Executive of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to be courageous in tackling the danger being posed to the judiciary and judicial officers in Nigeria by Malami through tough punitive measures against him, including his immediate suspension from the Bar.\n\nHe also called on the National Assembly to investigate the illegal invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s house, an action he described as a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to democracy in Nigeria.",

          "title": "20 things to know about Ayu, PDP chairman, his Buhari prediction",
          "text": "The new national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, who emerged by consensus early today, is not a greenhorn in Nigerian politics.\n\nAs a former lecturer in sociology and a Marxist, the 69 year-old politician understands Nigeria and its politics.\n\nSometimes he makes accurate predictions about the direction of the country in the dialectic struggle between the forces of change and conservatism.\n\nWhat he said about Muhammadu Buhari before he was elected in 2015 has proven to be correct.\n\nHere are some things to know about the new PDP chairman:\n\n1.Ayu is a son of Tivland, born in Gboko in Benue state 15 November 1952.\n\n2. He was educated at University of Jos\n\n3.He later became a a Marxist academic at the university. He taught students sociology and the science of Marxism.\n\n4.He was a radical activist and member of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU)\n\n5. He was the Chairman of the Jos University chapter of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU)\n\n6. Iyorchia Ayu was elected Senator in 1992 as a member of the Social Democratic Party, in the short-lived Third Republic under the Babangida administration.\n\n7. He later became senate president.\n\n8. As Senate president, he was impeached and replaced by Ameh Ebute.\n\n9. During the Abacha years, Ayu also served as minister for education from January 1994 to February 1995.\n\nHe was replaced by the controversial Alhaji Wada Nas.\n\n10. Ayu was part of moves to end Abacha military rule.\n\n11. During the transitional period to civilian rule, Ayu was part of the campaign to elect Olusegun Obasanjo as president in 1999.\n\n12. He was appointed Industry Minister by Obasanjo. He served between 1999 and 2001\n\n13. He later went on to serve as minister of internal affairs, from June 2003 to 2005. The National ID card project began during his tenure.\n\n14. He was also briefly minister of the environment between June 2005 and December 2005.\n\nHe soon fell out with Obasanjo and was dismissed from office without explanation.\n\n15. Ayu left the PDP and joined the Action Congress (AC) formed by Bola Tinubu, his former ally in the Senate.\n\n16. He was head of the campaign to elect Vice President Atiku Abubakar as president on the AC platform in April 2007.\n\n17. In February 2007, Ayu was arrested and later arraigned by a Federal court on charges of terrorism. He was later released on bail.\n\n18. Ayu later rejoined the PDP after Atiku also returned.\n\n19. Ayu, along with Atiku was a founding member of the All Progressives Congress. He also quit to return once again to PDP.\n\n20. Ayu, an Atiku supporter, was opposed to Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s emergence as President in 2015 and revealed his warning to Tinubu, years later.\n\nHe said he warned Tinubu, his friend, that he was making a mistake foisting Buhari on Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI talked to my friend, Tinubu, we are very close. I told him that we need to develop the progressive party in Nigeria. He didn\u2019t believe me, he preferred to go and link up with the most right wing group in the North.\n\n\u201cAnd that right wing group was headed by Buhari in the name of CPC\u2026 I have known Gen. Buhari when he was the military Head of State. I was a university lecturer then.\n\n\u201cI know the tyranny that was visited on this country. I warned Tinubu that he will regret bringing Buhari and imposing him on the party.\n\n\u201cI believe he is regretting silently without telling Nigerians. But more is to be expected. I am sorry to say that if Buhari is re-elected in 2019, it will not only consume Tinubu, it will consume so many other people. It may even lead to the disintegration of Nigeria,\u201d Ayu said in an interview.\n\n18. Now as PDP chairman, he is now poised to undo the error of Bola Tinubu, by bringing PDP back to power.\n\n\u201cThose who have lost hope should know that Nigeria is not a divided country. A small group of people decided to divide Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPDP will come back to unite our people, put them together, north and south, east and west.\n\n\u201cWe will move ahead to develop this country. We did it before. We are going to do it again\u201d, he said on Sunday.",

When we started this party 23 \u2013 24 years ago, we never in any way imagined that the journey will get us to this stage \u2013 a stage where we ruled for 16 years, we went into rough times but for anybody who will bother to see, PDP is back.\n\n\u201cAnd it is back to rescue Nigeria from the terrible mess we have been in the last six years.

He vowed to challenge the ruling.\n\nWhile Bayelsa State Governor served as the Co-Chairman of the PDP National Convention Election, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State is the Secretary.\n\nSee the full list of the newly-elected national officials of the main opposition party below:\n\nNational Chairman \u2013 Iyorchia Ayu\n\nDeputy National Chairman (North) \u2013 Umar Damagum (Contested)\n\nDeputy National Chairman (South) \u2013 Taofeek Arapaja (Contested)\n\nNational Secretary \u2013 Samuel Anyanwu (Unopposed)\n\nNational Treasurer \u2013 Ahmed Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nNational Organising Secretary \u2013 Umar Bature (Unopposed)\n\nNational Financial Secretary \u2013 Daniel Woyegikuro (Unopposed)\n\nNational Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Professor Stella Effah-Attoe (Unopposed)\n\nNational Youth Leader \u2013 Muhammed Suleiman (Contested)\n\nNational Legal Adviser \u2013 Kamaldeen Ajibade (Unopposed)\n\nNational Publicity Secretary \u2013 Debo Ologunagba (Unopposed)\n\nNational Auditor \u2013 Okechuckwu Daniel (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Secretary \u2013 Setoji Kosheodo (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Treasurer \u2013 Ndubisi David (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Publicity Secretary \u2013 Ibrahim Abdullahi (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Organising Secretary \u2013 Ighoyota Amori (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Financial Secretary \u2013 Adamu Kamale (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Hajara Wanka (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Youth Leader \u2013 Timothy Osadolor (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Legal Adviser \u2013 Okechukwu Osuoha (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Auditor \u2013 Abdulrahman Mohammed (Unopposed)",

          "title": "Japan Votes in Test for New PM Kishida, Political Stability",
          "text": "Japanese voters went to the polls on Sunday to decide whether to endorse the conservative government of Fumio Kishida or weaken the new prime minister and possibly return the world\u2019s third-largest economy to a period of political uncertainty.\n\nThe vote is a test for Kishida, who called the election soon after taking the top post early this month, and for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been battered by its perceived mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAlready, Kishida has struggled to advance policies to help poorer people, while securing a big boost in military spending and taking a harder line on China.\n\nWith his lacklustre image failing to inspire voters, the LDP is on the brink of losing its majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time since 2009, opinion polls show, although its coalition with junior partner Komeito will stay in power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say the pandemic is completely snuffed out and society is stable, so we shouldn\u2019t have any big changes in coronavirus policy,\u201d said Naoki Okura, a doctor, after voting in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cRather than demanding a change in government, I think we should demand continuity.\u201d\n\nVoting ends at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), with projected results likely to come soon afterward from media exit polls.\n\nTOUGH CONTESTS, REVOLVING DOOR?\n\nSeveral key LDP lawmakers are facing particularly tough contests, including Akira Amari, the party\u2019s secretary general.\n\n\u201cRevolving-door prime ministers is a weakness that many outside of Japan fear,\u201d Sheila A. Smith, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog post. \u201cPrime Minister Kishida will need a unified party and a strong electoral showing on Oct. 31 if he is to successfully tackle Japan\u2019s difficult national agenda.\u201d\n\nTurnout will be crucial, since higher turnout tends to favour the opposition. As of 2 p.m., turnout stood at 21.49%, down 0.34 point from the previous lower house poll \u2013 but 16.6 million voted in advance, the Internal Affairs Ministry said.\n\nThe biggest opposition group, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is expected to gain seats but not come near toppling Kishida\u2019s coalition.\n\n\u201cThe only party with policies aimed at people in their 20s and 30s is the Constitutional Democrats, things like income tax and so on,\u201d said office worker Daisuke Matsumoto, 27. \u201cIt\u2019s true other parties have policies aimed at child-raising, but what about those of us who are childless?\u201d\n\nA big loss of LDP seats could lead to party infighting, returning Japan to an era of short-lived administrations that diminished its global stature, until Shinzo Abe helmed the country for a record eight years to September 2020. The dovish Komeito could also gain more clout within the coalition.\n\nUncertainty is high, with the Nikkei newspaper estimating 40% of single-seat districts have close races and recent polls showing some 40% of voters undecided.\n\nKishida\u2019s publicly stated goal is for his coalition to keep a majority, at least 233 seats, of the 465 in the lower house. Before the election, the coalition had a commanding two-thirds majority of 305, with the LDP holding 276.\n\nInvestors and political watchers are focussed on whether the LDP \u2013 in power for all but brief spells since it was formed in 1955 \u2013 can keep its majority as a single party. Losing that would erode Kishida\u2019s power base in the factional LDP and the party\u2019s standing against the Komeito.\n\nThe usually splintered opposition is united, arranging for only one party \u2013 including the widely shunned Japanese Communist Party \u2013 to face off against the coalition in most districts, with analysts saying this is creating a number of neck-and-neck battles.\n\nBut the opposition has failed to capture the hearts of voters, with only 8% supporting the Constitutional Democrats while 39% back the LDP, according to a poll last week by public broadcaster NHK.\n\nStill, some voters \u2013 like Yoshihiko Suzuki, who voted for the Constitutional Democrat in his voting district and the Communists in proportional representation \u2013 hoped the poll might teach the LDP a lesson.\n\nSuzuki, 68 and retired, said Abe\u2019s eight years in power made the LDP complacent and arrogant, underscored by a series of money and cronyism scandals.\n\n\u201cI hope this election comes as a wakeup call for them,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it does, the LDP will become a better party, considering the number of talented lawmakers they\u2019ve got.",

We are trying to learn something from him,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHe gives advice to every leader of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and we are following his rules, advice, and if we have a progressive government in the future, it\u2019s because of his advice.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Prospects of southern presidential candidate brighten as Ayu emerges national chair\n\n\u2022Party inaugurates new NWC members December 9\n\n\u2022Atiku, Tambuwal, Saraki\u2019s loyalists flood venue with presidential campaign posters\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nWith the successful conduct of a peaceful convention and strong cohesion among its various organs and chieftains, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday kicked off the process of retaking power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe emergence of a former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu as the new National Chairman of the party from the National Convention held yesterday in Abuja, has also brightened the prospects of southern Nigeria to produce the presidential candidate of the party in 2023.\n\nAt the Eagle Square, Abuja venue of the convention, party chieftains such as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Chairman of the party\u2019s convention committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Mr. Ahmadu Fintiri; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; and Chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal spoke glowingly on the party\u2019s chances to retake power in 2023.\n\nThe party affirmed Ayu; the National Secretary, Senator Samuel Daddy Anyanwu, and others as the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who will be inaugurated on December 9 this year.\n\nThe main opposition party will also amend its constitution after the new Electoral Act is signed into law.\n\nChairman of the party\u2019s convention committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Fintiri, who disclosed the affirmation yesterday at the venue of the convention, said the convention was aimed at rescuing Nigeria from the bad governance of the APC.\n\nAyu and Anyanwu were affirmed as national chairman and national secretary following their nomination through consensus.\n\nAyu was nominated by the North-central, while Anyanwu was nominated by the South-east and both candidates were unopposed at the convention.\n\nAs at press time last night, only two offices were being contested for at the convention, as other contestants for the position of National Auditor stepped down for Mr. Sam Ben Nwosu late last night.\n\nThe office of the Deputy National Chairman (South) was being contested by a former national secretary of PDP, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former deputy national chairman of the party in the South-west, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja.\n\nThe office of the Youth Leader was also being contested.\n\nThe zoning committee of the party headed by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State had zoned the office of the national chairman to the North.\n\nTraditionally, when the national chairman emerges from the North, the presidential candidate of the party will emerge from the South and vice versa.\n\nThe emergence of Ayu from the North as the national chairman has raised hopes for a possible emergence of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe development has also brightened the prospects of a southerner succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari as the APC is also favourably disposed to field a southern presidential candidate.\n\nGovernors Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State; Babagana Zulum of Borno State; Darius Ishaku of Taraba State; Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State; Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State \u2013 all elected on the platform of the ruling party, as well as Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State (PDP), among others, had all expressed their preference for power to shift to the South.\n\nHowever, the venue of the PDP convention was flooded with the presidential campaign posters of a former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso; former Vice President Atiku; former Senate President, Saraki; Bauchi State governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; his Sokoto State counterpart, Tambuwal, and former governor of Bauchi State, Adamu Muazu.\n\nMeanwhile, Fintiri said that Ayu and other members of the PDP would be sworn in on December 9 this year, to enable the outgoing NWC members to complete their tenure of four years, having been elected and sworn in on December 9, 2017.\n\nHe said the party is aimed at rescuing Nigeria from the pangs of the maladministration it has been plunged into in the past few years.\n\nFintiri said since the APC was elected in 2015, the testimony of those who jumped into the party\u2019s ship is a telltale of how things have worsened in the land.\n\n\u201cThe political mutation of the party over the years has seen a few of foundational members veering off sometimes. The confessions of most of those who sojourned to any other party in the country are loaded with regrets. Most of them are lucky to stage a comeback and as a magnanimous family, we are always glad to receive them with all privileges, back into our folds.\n\n\u201cFor those, who are still contemplating a return, but are held back by any other force less than Nigeria, I call on you to break the force and return to where you rightly belong. It is time to rescue Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cWe have always been there for Nigeria at its perilous time of need. We are not just a vehicle for winning elections but a symbolism of a free, democratic, and prosperous Nigeria that works for every citizen. We have demonstrated our commitment to these time-tested ideals that Nigerians have every reason to trust us enough more than a contraption that was formed solely to win the election and around the personal ambitions of certain individuals bereft of the knowledge of what to do with the victory,\u201d Fintiri explained.\n\nThe Adawama State governor said Nigerians are yearning for the return of the party, particularly at the centre in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat the people relish those golden moments when the PDP held sway at the centre is not in doubt. That citizens are yearning for the return of PDP at the centre as the 2023 elections draw nearer, is equally not in doubt.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore have a duty not to disappoint our teeming supporters. We have to take back our country as we have always done. We have to save Nigeria. If we could force the country out of the clutches of the military, we can do this one huge task-push the people who don\u2019t know the true definition of good governance and national co-existence out of power.\n\n\u201cThis is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 national convention, presents a starting point for the Nigeria rescue mission,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that 34 candidates indicated interests in various national positions in the party, out of which 28 were cleared, two withdrew voluntarily while four were disqualified.\n\nFintiri said that there were 21 positions to be contested for and a total of 3,600 delegates to elect the officials.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis convention will also not allow us to make and adopt amendments to our constitution. This is because we are foreseeing a need for more amendments after the new Electoral Act passed by the National Assembly is signed into law.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore deferring the votes on constitutional amendments to a special convention to be held on any convenient date to be decided by the NEC.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Senate Minority Leader, Senator. Enyinnaya Abaribe noted that Nigeria was going through difficult moments.\n\nOn his part, the outgoing national secretary of PDP, Senator Umar Tsuari said that the party encountered several challenges during their tenure.\n\nAlso speaking, the acting national chairman of the party, Mr. Yemi Akinwonmi, called on party members to \u201ccome together, bury our personal, individual and collective differences and put PDP and the interest of Nigeria above any consideration.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu described the convention of the party as the engine for a new beginning\n\nHe said Nigerians are yearning for freedom from the suppressive, incompetent, cold-blooded, arrogant, treasury looting and anti-people APC.\n\nWe Have a Chance to Set the Ship Aright, Says Atiku\n\nAddressing the delegates and party officials, former Vice President Atiku charged all Nigerians to take the opportunity presented by the PDP to set Nigeria aright.\n\nHe said that the convention is an opportunity to make decisions that would shape the future of the party for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\nAtiku said Nigeria was passing through the most difficult period of its existence, saying that he is over 70 years and had never seen the country in such a shape.\n\nHe said there was so much insecurity and social tension which were threatening the unity and corporate existence of the country.\n\nPDP is Winning Despite Distractions, Says Tambuwal\n\nAlso speaking at the convention, the Chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Tambuwal expressed optimism that the party is set to reclaim its glory.\n\nAccording to Tambuwal, despite the antics of detractors to roll back the 16 years\u2019 impressive credentials of the party, the party is still at the forefront and endearing.\n\n\u201cAnalysts and observers agreed that there are attempts to scuttle our unity as a party and as a people. People are working to present us as weak and in disarray.\n\n\u201cBut I am happy to report that contrary to the naysayers the PDP is today the strongest and most cohesive party in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am happy to report that those who want to divide and weaken us are the ones failing and we are winning,\u201d Tambuwal told a joyous and tumultuous crowd.\n\nAnyim Declares Interest for 2023 Presidency\n\nMeanwhile, a former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has declared that he will contest for the office of the President in 2023, no matter any zoning arrangement by the PDP.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Abuja yesterday, Anyim noted that his ambition would not be tied to the zoning of the presidency to the South-east by the party.\n\n\u201cWe presently have less than 18 months to the next elections and I feel the time was ripe to indicate my interest.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the zoning committee constituted by the party was only saddled with zoning party positions and not elective positions ahead of 2023.\n\n\u201cZoning of such positions was deferred but nothing stops anyone from the South-east zone from contesting the presidency even if it was not zoned to it,\u201d he added.",
