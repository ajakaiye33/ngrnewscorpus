Iyiochia Ayu-led National Working Committee, for allegedly denying Rivers State a slot in the panel.\n\nA source familiar with the matter who confided in our correspondent, said, \u201c Wike is very angry and he has made this known. In fact, he confronted the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, who stood in as guarantor for Ayu at the time he was elected.\n\n\u201c He told Ortom, \u2018You brought this man, see what he is doing? \u2018\n\n\u201cIt was a serious oversight but Wike does not see it that way. And you can\u2019t ignore his concerns because, how do you explain the presence of Representatives from Sokoto, Kwara and other states where other presidential aspirants come from, how else can you explain the absence of a representative from Rivers State which bears the golden egg?\n\n\u201cAs far as he is concerned, the party chairman who is a known ally of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, maybe playing a dangerous game. \u201c\n\nIt was equally gathered that this, among other issues, was responsible for the delay in the commencement of the Caucus, BoT and 96 NEC meeting.\n\nThe series of meetings were scheduled to begin with a caucus meeting at 10am but were shifted by a few hours to enable for wider consultations and resolution of the seeming impasse.\n\nAnother party source said, \u201cYou are trying to make a storm out of a tea cup. There is no issue here, whatever list is prepared, we will meet and agree on it before it is ratified by NEC, it is a none issue.\u201d\n\nWhen the meeting reconvened at 8:15pm, the atmosphere was more relaxed as members filed into the NEC Hall.\n\nIn his opening remarks before it went into a closed session, National Chairman of the party, Sen. Iyiochia Ayu, commended party members for their support for the changes brought about by the new leadership of the party.\n\nHe admitted that his team has been \u201cunder pressure \u201c to ensure that things are done properly to enable the party take its rightful place in the scheme of things.\n\nAyu promised to continue to improve on existing physical structures of the party as well and create a conducive atmosphere for the party to return to power in 2023.\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Aminu Tambuwual in his remarks said, \u201cThe mood of the party now is that we are all being mobilized for a successful National Convention. We as governors of the party will continue to work towards success of our programmes.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, said, the meeting was convened to enable the party take \u201ccritical decisions on issues affecting our party in our march towards rescuing our country. \u201c\n\nThose at the meeting include: Former Vice Presidents Atiku Abubakar, Namadi Sambo, former Senate Presidents, David Mark, Bukola Saraki, Pius Anyim and Governors Samuel Ortom (Benue), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), UdomEmmanuel (Akwa Ibom) among others.

Jator Abido expressed satisfaction with Mr. Presidents orders, noting that it has helped to distinguish him as a man of honour who does not associate himself with lawlessness.\n\nThe NDYC prayed further that with Akpabio specifically out of the way now, the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will breath fresh air and experience a turn around for good.\n\n\u201cThis singular act of Mr. President has brought about trust in his leadership and the anti-corruption fight. We have particularly frowned at the delay in inaugurating the NDDC Board which was orchestrated by the then Minister of the Niger Delta Senator Godswill Akpabio under the cover of a forensic audit to enrich himself. Now that he is out of the way, we are confident the Board will be inaugurated and development will return to the Niger Delta\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nWhile urging Mr. President to expedite actions on the inauguration of the NDDC Board to serve as a vehicle that will drive development in the Niger Delta region, the group equally urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to as a matter of urgency probe the Commission and the outgoing Minister of the Niger Delta as his tenure was marred by impunity and gross corruption.\n\n\u201cWe call on Mr. President and the EFCC to quickly begin to investigate and audit the accounts of the NDDC and those of the Ministry of Niger Delta affairs to ensure that money meant for the development of the Niger Delta region must not be used by Akpabio and his cronies in sponsoring his campaigns and luxurious lifestyle at the expense of the poor and vulnerable people of the Niger Delta\u201d, the statement added.\n\nSimilarly, the NDYC expressed their willingness to partner and work with aspirants from the Niger Delta region and Nigeria at large who have concrete solutions to Nigeria\u2019s problems especially the challenges facing the region.\n\n\u201cAs the 2023 general elections draw near, we wish to state categorically that our doors are open to partner and work with candidates who have the interest of Nigeria at heart. With more than 40% of voters in the Niger Delta as our members, our partnership will surely be rewarding\u201d, the statement concluded.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has accused Professor Ignatius Uduk of the Physical and Health Education department in the University of Uyo, Uyo Akwa Ibom State of delaying court proceedings on a case of electoral fraud against him.\n\nUduk, who was the Collation/Returning officer for Essien Udim State constituency in the 2019 general elections, is standing trial on a-three-count charge bordering on abandonment of duties, announcing and publishing false election results as well as lying under oath\n\nSpeaking after court proceedings on Wednesday at the Akwa Ibom State High Court sitting in Uyo, Counsel to INEC, Mr Clement Onwuenwunor, said the defence counsel delayed proceedings when he filed an application with a different suit number which requires a different file.\n\nOnwuenwunor stated that the prosecution has closed its case since January 27, 2022, which gave the defence counsel sufficient time to put up their defence if they have any, but the defence counsel failed in that regard.\n\n\u201cWell, every defence counsel has a case strategy and from what we\u2019ve seen so far, they decided to exhaust the options available to him. After the ruling on 27th of January, we expected them to come up with a defence if they have any, but unfortunately we\u2019re seeing some form of filibustering so far.\n\n\u201cYes, he filed a case but in a different file; not in the substantive case file. So it was filed with a different suit number and a different file. The procedure of the registry is that before the Judge can handle such a file, it must come through the chief judge. So that application frustrated that case from being heard together.\n\n\u201cWe have been ready since January. We\u2019ve called five witnesses in this matter with an avalanche of evidence, documents and then on this side, we\u2019re comfortable with the case we\u2019ve presented and we have been appealing to them that there\u2019s every need to ask for the defence to clear his name.\n\n\u201cAs a university professor, there\u2019s a serious need for him to clear his name so we can be done and dusted with this matter and what the constitution states is that those charged with a criminal case are allowed a fair hearing for a period of time. He has had almost five months since we cleared our case.\n\n\u201cIt is taking too long to conclude. If they don\u2019t have any defence, we expect that they throw away the towel. It is not compulsory to defend the case. What is necessary is that they are given the opportunity to defend their case and if they don\u2019t want to utilize that opportunity, then we have extra options available to us,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Presiding Judge, Justice Bassey Nkanang adjourned the case to May 18, 2022.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nScores of the Nigerian civil war veterans on Wednesday staged a peaceful protest in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, over the non-payment of their entitlements by the Federal Government in the past 44 years.\n\nThe civil war, also known as Biafran War, was fought for 30 months between 1967 and 1970. The leader of the Biafran Republic then was Chief Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, while the Military Head of State for Nigeria then is Gen Yakubu Gowon (retd).\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe protest, which took off from the state secretariat of the Nigerian Legion at American Quarters, Idi-Ape, Ibadan, ended at the entrance of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). The civil war veterans trekked from their secretariat to NTA and the majority of them did not show any sign of fatigue at the end of the protest.\n\nThe protesters carried placards with inscriptions, including \u2018We are the civil war veterans\u2019, \u2018We were used and dumped by the Nigerian government\u2019, \u2018We are dying in silence\u2019, \u201944 years unpaid pension to the Nigeria Civil War veterans\u2019, \u2018We laid down our lives for the unity of this country, but punishment was compensation\u2019, \u2018We were verified in 2015 and issued with genuine pensioners\u2019 certificate but no payment\u2019, \u2018Is it a crime to defend a nation?\u2019 \u2018Majority of us were on sick bed, suffering from stroke.\u2019\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nNational Coordinator, First Intake Able Voluntary Retired or Discharged Ten or More Years in Military Service, Pa Babawande Philips, told journalists during the protest: \u201cWe have been so much deprived of our pensions for the past 44 years. They have denied us of our pensions. The irony of it is that they said we are not qualified because we didn\u2019t clock 15 years in service.\n\n\u201cIt was Decree 102 they used against us. This Decree 102 was not supposed to be used against us because they didn\u2019t use it against the Biafrans, that fought against Nigeria. One thing I know that is sure is President Muhammadu Buhari, has not been aware of what is happening because we were \u2018Buhari\u2019s Boys\u2019 during the civil wartime.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cIn our early 20s and late 30s, we all enlisted into the Nigerian Army and we fought for a period of 10 years and above. When the government depopulated Nigeria\u2019s workforce, some of us crossed to various places like the police, customs, immigration, schools and so on.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cSo, we have been on this agitation since 2002. In 2007, there was a biometric capturing and out of a lot of us, that they captured, a few people were being paid, and they are collecting their pensions since then.\n\n\u201cWe had been on litigation and Femi Falana (SAN) has been our lawyer. We were in court for several years. We had a series of court adjournments. But when it got to 2015, they said we should settle out of court. They called on us to do another verification in 2015. Then, we were issued with biometric data paper, where they wrote genuine pensioners. Since then, we have been waiting to receive our pensions, but all to no avail.\n\n\u201cNow, they (Nigerian Army) are claiming that anyone that doesn\u2019t serve up to 15 years is not qualified to receive pensions. But they have forgotten that there was a circular that came out in 1977, where it was stated that any soldier man that clocks 10 years or more, but less than 15 years, is qualified to receive pensions, and they would be entitled to 40 per cent of their terminal salaries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether they are not aware of this circular. If they are not aware of it, they should go and search for it. We have all these documents with us. We have the verification papers, biometrically captured in 2007 and 2015. We all have it with us. So, we don\u2019t know the reason why they should continue to punish us. A lot of my people are in abject poverty, many have died.\n\n\u201cWe laid our lives for the unity of this nation. I wonder why they are treating us like this. We want the whole nation to know that we are being cheated. Those who fought from the Biafran side have been paid, and that is the irony of it. Why were they paid and they left us unpaid; we that laid our lives for the unity of this nation? The whole world must know about this.\n\n\u201cOn the nominal role, we have 780 of us that have not been paid. The number may be more than that. So, we appeal to the Federal Government to yield to our clarion call. If a person used a day in the war front, you can\u2019t equate it with somebody who used a year outside the war. The Biafran soldiers were paid in batches and they have all been paid to the last kobo. The last batch was paid last year, about 112 of them.\u201d\n\nSecretary, First Intake Able Voluntary Retired or Discharged Ten or More Years in Military Service, Lance Corporal Joseph Also Popoola, who also spoke with journalists, said: \u201cIt has been hard.

          "title": "APC Ticket: Jonathan Gives Conditions, Sale of Forms Extended to May 12",
          "text": "\u2022Former president joining our party, running for office will be one of the wonders of the century, says Umahi\n\n\u2022N100m forms: Presidential aspirant defects, alleges party has commercialised primary process\n\n\u2022High cost of APC, PDP presidential forms worries Kukah\n\n\u2022Warns Nigerians unwittingly pushing for plutocracy\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\n\n\nFresh facts have emerged from the recent meeting in Abuja between the former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, and National Chairman of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, which was held behind closed doors.\n\nThe revelation from the meeting emerged just as the APC last night extended the sale of its nomination and expression of interest forms to Thursday May 12, 2022, while aspirants who had already bought forms are now expected to start submitting same on Friday May 13. According to a three-paragraph statement from the ruling party, although the original deadline for sale of forms was yesterday, the two work-free days observed last week were said to have encroached into the original timetable. Hence, the extension.\n\n\u201cFollowing the new submission date, APC has fixed Saturday May 14 and Sunday May 15 for screening of all aspirants that have returned their duly completed and signed nomination and expression of interest forms to the APC Secretariat,\u201d it added.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu took place amid wide speculation that APC was hatching a deal with the former president to adopt him as the party\u2019s presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nBut a reliable source said Jonathan, currently a member of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), told Adamu he would join the presidential race on the ruling party\u2019s platform only if he was assured of being made the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, also a presidential aspirant under APC, said the participation of Jonathan in the party\u2019s presidential primaries this month would be another wonder of the world.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came as one of the presidential aspirants on the APC platform, Adamu Garba, left the party yesterday over the N100 million cost of its presidential nomination and expression of interest forms. Garba said the humongous sum was tantamount to commercialisation of the APC presidential ticket.\n\nIn a similar vein, Catholic Bishop of the Sokoto Diocese, His Grace Matthew Hassan Kukah, expressed worry over the huge amounts being charged presidential aspirants by the two major political parties, APC and PDP. Kukah said the country was walking the fine line between democracy and plutocracy, but might soon jettison the former.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu took place few hours after a Fulani group, under the aegis of Nomadic Pastoralists and the Almajiri Communities, purchased the ruling party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms for the former president.\n\nHowever, THISDAY reliably learnt late last night that people like Chief Mike Oghiadomhe, Jonathan\u2019s Chief of Staff while he was in office and some other close aides to the former president are opposed to him running at all because they feel he would be disgraced down the line. \u201cThey were the people that drafted the hard-line press statement earlier yesterday, which was withdrawn few minutes after for the statement currently in circulation, because they don\u2019t want him to run. As you may have noticed, the second statement was watered down version of the first one \u201d\n\nThe source who is familiar with the ongoing talks disclosed, \u201cThe former president just wants a coronation as the presidential ticket bearer.\u201d\n\nThe response of the APC chairman to Jonathan\u2019s request for consensus presidential ticket was not clear. But THISDAY learnt that while only President Muhammadu Buhari could give the final approval for such an agreement, interest groups within the party would oppose such an arrangement.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s findings further revealed that in the one-hour meeting between Jonathan and Adamu, the demand of the former president was neither rejected nor accepted.\n\nThe meeting, held between 9pm and 10pm, and was organised in a bid to sort out grey issues concerning Jonathan\u2019s bid to fly the APC presidential flag in next year\u2019s poll.\n\nIt was gathered that if the consensus candidacy deal goes through, the former president might have the governor of Borno State, Professor Babagana Zulum, as his running mate.\n\n\u201cGranting him his request as a consensus candidate is still dicey because of the presidential declaration of Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source, who is one of Jonathan\u2019s relations, told THISDAY, \u201cThe former president gave the condition that all hurdles that could stand against him becoming the consensus candidate of the APC should be cleared before he would formally join the APC and the presidential race.\n\n\u201cNothing is guaranteed. The meeting was part of the usual meetings since Sunday, but heightened with the purchase of the presidential form.\n\n\u201cYou could see that the first statement by Oga\u2019s aide said he was not consulted before the purchase of the presidential form and, therefore, it should be disregarded. The second statement from the same person was more subtle, stating that there is no commitment from the side of President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cFrom the two statements, one thing that is clear is that the APC national chairman did not confirm that he (Jonathan) will be the consensus presidential candidate. Abdullahi Adamu told him that he could not categorically assure that he will become the consensus candidate without further clarification from the president, who was outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe brother and former aide of Jonathan summed up the discussion at the meeting, thus, \u201cNothing was guaranteed and, hence, Oga said he was not committed to the pursuit of his presidential ambition on the platform of the APC.\u201d\n\nThe former aide said the grey issues to clear up regarding Jonathan\u2019s potential candidacy on the platform of APC included the proposed one-term of four years.\n\nAccording to reports, the confusion that followed the purchase of the presidential form for Jonathan arose because of the spirited efforts by his loyalists in PDP to dissuade him from joining APC and running on its platform. Jonathan\u2019s supporters were said to believe doing that would mean belittling his image.\n\nAnother reliable source said the former president had earlier met with the APC leadership last Sunday and concluded plans to accept the nomination form, but he was strongly discouraged by his close friends, who advised him to remain in PDP.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThese people have been pressurising Jonathan until the very last minute not to accept to run on the APC ticket, no matter how tempting the conditions may be.\n\n\u201cThat was why the former president did not present himself to the APC national chairman on Sunday, when the form was to be formally presented to him by the Almajiri group, who wanted to show him appreciation for what he did for them during his tenure by building schools and rehabilitating them.\u201d\n\nThe source, speaking on what prompted Jonathan to meet Adamu, said, \u201cThe main argument of those opposed to Jonathan running on the APC ticket is that it would be belittling to his image and standing in the world for him to do so, given where he has been and what he represents as a former president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut the point is that the deadline for picking the form is this week and if he does not accept the form, the window would be closed and the opportunity lost.\n\n\u201cThat was why the former president had to meet Adamu last night and their meeting was very productive, as both men came out happily at the end of the one-hour meeting in Adamu\u2019s house in Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of Bayelsa State chapter of APC, Dennis Otiotio, said the former president was at liberty to join the party, even though he was yet to register. Otiotio spoke to newsmen in a telephone interview, saying he is not aware of Jonathan\u2019s membership.\n\nThe APC state chairman said, \u201cThe former president is not yet a registered member of APC. He is free to join any party of his choice.\n\n\u201cWe are open and willing to receive him into our fold. As a political party desirous of winning elections, the only way to go is by admitting people into the party.\u201d\n\nFollowing the purchase of the presidential form for him, the former president had said in a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, that he was not aware of the development and did not authorise it.\n\nThe statement released on Monday read, \u201cIt has come to the notice of His Excellency, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms of the APC in his name. We wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 presidential election, we wish to state, that he has not in anyway, committed himself to this request.\n\n\u201cWe thank the general public for their concern, as we continue to encourage citizens\u2019 participation in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nJonathan Will Be a Hard Sell for APC, Says Umahi\n\nEbonyi State Governor Dave Umahi warned that Jonathan would be difficult to elect as APC\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2023 general election. The governor told newsmen yesterday after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja, that it would be difficult for the ruling party to campaign with Jonathan as its presidential candidate.\n\nUmahi, who is one of the 26 presidential aspirants of APC, said although there had been denials of the former president\u2019s rumoured move to APC, if he eventually defected to the ruling party, it would be a material for the Guinness Book of Records. He wondered how APC would reconcile its policies and promises with those of PDP under which Jonathan was president from 2010 to 2015.\n\nAccording to Umahi, \u201cThe reason is that if you go and see the campaign programmes of APC and you now ask President Jonathan to come and run, I don\u2019t know what will be our campaign promises and what will be the stories we will be telling Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI believe strongly that he was not aware of the forms and I want to believe that people that are mischievous would have bought the forms to embarrass him.\n\n\u201cBut from what I read, he has quickly distanced himself from that. Like I said, if that is not the case, then the Guinness Book of Records is not totally filled up.\u201d\n\nOn his views about Jonathan joining the presidential race, the governor recounted that God used the former president and his wife for him to emerge as Ebonyi State governor seven years ago.\n\nUmahi stated, \u201cJonathan is my father and God used him and the wife to make me governor of the state and so, anybody who has done anything for me, I\u2019ve always remained very grateful to such a person and I will continue to be very grateful to him, the wife for being available and my destiny helper.\n\n\u201cProbably if that miracle did not take place, then the miracles that happened in Ebonyi State, in terms of total evolution and transformation, wouldn\u2019t have taken place.\n\n\u201cSo, he is a man we cannot forget, just like Sani Abacha, who created the state and Mr. President. Of course, we have named the airport after him, we have named the light tunnel after him, we have named the Presidential Lodge after him.\u201d\n\nUmahi, however, stressed that it would be a wonder ran for president on the APC platform.\n\nHe stated, \u201cGood intention that we don\u2019t forget people who have helped us, but on the question of joining, I may not say much about that because I\u2019ve seen a lot of write ups, denials, but if he decides to join and to run, it will, for me, become one of the wonders in this century.\u201d\n\nN100m Form: APC Presidential Aspirant Defects, Alleges Adamu Has Commercialised Primary Process\n\nAdamu Garba announced his defection from APC yesterday, saying he would disclose his new party within the next few days. He advised those who had contributed money to his campaign to seek refund immediately.\n\nGarba spoke at a news conference in Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have recorded the sum of N81, 750,000.00 in private donations and N1, 457, 794.70 in online donations, totalling N83, 207,794.70.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely, immensely, and graciously thank everyone for these wonderful contributions and donations, including those who made theirs anonymously.\n\n\u201cWe, however, request that all those who donated online and who require a refund send an email with evidence of payment to adamugarba@adamugarba.org. I assure you of a complete refund upon request.\n\n\u201cThose that made private donations, we know them, we will meet them and settle this out.\u201d\n\nGarba added, \u201cIncidentally, if your donations are done for pursuing our course for the presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the coming 2023 election, the battle is not over yet. Kindly do bear with us for further directives in the coming days.\n\n\u201cI deeply, immensely appreciate my supporters, friends, well-wishers, and the well-meaning Nigerian youth who contributed unceasingly to this journey.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of APC had commercialised the process leading to the emergence of a credible candidate for the party in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe also expressed fear that the leadership of the party could further compromise the process with the inclusion of the voluntary withdrawal form in the nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nGarba predicted that the NWC might adopt consensus to pick an anointed candidate and ask other aspirants, who had obtained forms with N100 million, to seek refund.\n\nHe maintained that the NWC\u2019s latest directive that 10 statutory delegates must sign the forms of the aspirants had automatically made the party\u2019s ticket accessible only to the highest bidder.\n\nAccording to Garba, \u201cInformation at our disposal has it that some aspirants are paying as much as N50, 000 to each statutory delegate to get their forms signed.\n\n\u201cAfter high-level deliberation with our internal campaign team, we have concluded that we will not be obtaining the expression of interest and nomination form for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the platform of the APC.\u201d\n\nNigerians Unwittingly Pushing for Plutocracy, Says Kukah\n\nCatholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, His Grace Matthew Hassan Kukah, spoke on the topic, \u201cCitizens Participation in a Democracy,\u201d during a brief ceremony to mark the 60th birthday of veteran civil society activist, and Director of the Policy and Legislative Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Mr. Clement Nwankwo. Kukah said Nigeria could not get the right citizens\u2019 participation in governance if people did not believe in the constitution or the electoral process.\n\nHe said some of the bizarre things \u201cbeing witnessed today in our democracy have tended exclude citizens from participation in governance.\u201d\n\nKukah explained, \u201cWe went for democracy because we think it is the best form of government, but as it is now, if you want to declare interest to participate in the process or to pick your expression of interest form, despite the quality of your certificate, you went to Harvard, you went to Oxford and you went to that other institution.\n\n\u201cThis is not about your ability, no, it is not acceptable, if you don\u2019t have N100 million or N50 million to buy a nomination form or you don\u2019t have the kind of friends that can buy it for you.\n\n\u201cYou see, this thing has been reduced to some kind of joke and Nigerians are sitting and watching in disbelieve and keeping quiet, that somebody will just wake up one day to pick a nomination form for N100 million, that person may not have been able to drill a borehole for his village or give scholarship to his people.\n\n\u201cWe have to pay the price because we are complicit. What this means is that someone fixed the price saying that poor people don\u2019t have to apply, that only rich people can participate in the process. We should not pretend that we are running a democracy, we are rather pushing for plutocracy \u2013 government of the rich for the rich people.\u201d\n\nKukah said every country deserved the quality of leadership it had constructed, adding that in Nigeria\u2019s case, bad leadership has given birth to the monster of insecurity now haunting everyone.\n\nAccording to Kukah, constitution is a major factor that helps in uniting citizens and promoting good governance in any country.\n\nThe fiery cleric regretted that Nigeria\u2019s constitution had remained an issue of contention and debate for many years. He also said the issue of citizenship in the country was still in suspended animation, adding that the simplest thing that a citizen should enjoy from the state had remained elusive.\n\nKukah said there was need to find ways to manage ethnic and religious diversity if Nigeria was to attain true nationhood.\n\nEarlier, the celebrant said Kukah had been a pillar of support for civil society groups for many decades.\n\nNwankwo recalled a memorable event in his life, when he got married to his wife in 1996 with Bishop Kukah officiating. He narrated how he had to sneak out from one of the foreign embassies to attend the wedding during the military rule.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Garba said the humongous sum was tantamount to commercialisation of the APC presidential ticket.\nThe meeting was part of the usual meetings since Sunday, but heightened with the purchase of the presidential form.\n\u201cYou could see that the first statement by Oga\u2019s aide said he was not consulted before the purchase of the presidential form and, therefore, it should be disregarded.\nThe second statement from the same person was more subtle, stating that there is no commitment from the side of President Jonathan.\nThe APC state chairman said, \u201cThe former president is not yet a registered member of APC.",

Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Y Combinator is changing the African startup game",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY Combinator, a US-based seed-stage accelerator, is a household name in Africa\u2019s startup space, especially if you\u2019ve paid attention to stories across major tech publications.\n\nWhen this company burst onto the US startup space on March 11, 2005, the early-stage startup investment space was markedly different than it is today. To quote co-founder Paul Graham, \u201cYou\u2019d get that first $10k from your friend\u2019s rich uncle. The deal terms were often a disaster; often neither the investor nor the founders nor the lawyer knew what the documents should look like.\u201d\n\nGraham wanted to standardise seed-stage funding for startups, and he enlisted Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. After a pretty shaky start, their success is palpable for any neutral observer.\n\nIf you opened this article out of curiosity, it would help you understand what YC is \u2014 a company that helps technology startups rapidly grow their business. The parlance for such companies today is an accelerator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d find other popular companies like Techstars, 500 startups, and AngelPad. YC, however, has grown to have a significant global presence, with a significant impact in Africa.\n\nIt organises an intensive three-month programme for technology founders globally twice a year and funds them with $500,000 (previously $150,000). It wasn\u2019t until three years post-launch that YC invested in Canada\u2019s A thinking Ape, a company outside the US.\n\nIn 2009, YC supposedly made its first entry into Africa with the now-defunct Petasales. However, there\u2019s little to no information about them online. In 2012, Senegal\u2019s Wave got into Y Combinator, signifying a major entry into Africa for YC. However, both of Wave\u2019s founders are not African.\n\nOolu (a Senegalese energy startup) and Saida (a Kenyan lending startup) went through the accelerator in 2015, with Saida\u2019s founders seemingly the first African founders to get in. And nearly every year since, African startups have gotten into YC.\n\nThe obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow would probably be a good time to read our analysis which seems to show that the Nigerian founder\u2019s increasing interest in YC was mainly a ploy to raise more investor funds. While there\u2019s significant room to explore, some YC founders believe fundraising is a byproduct of YC\u2019s biggest attraction \u2014 its high-value network.\n\nFew founders describe the experience like Perseus Mlambo, CEO of Union54, a Zambian fintech.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of strength in knowing that whatever problem you will encounter, there are thousands of other founders who have faced that problem, and are going to respond to you with a guide on navigating that problem,\u201d Mlambo insists.\n\nHe opines that this network serves as a key instrument for solving problems of hiring and fundraising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe best talent wants to work in high growth places and the education that you go through on YC positions you to be ready for that growth. And inevitably, the best capital allocators will take notice,\u201d he maintains.\n\nFor two Nigerian founders, Ikenna Nzewi (CEO of Releaf) and Pelumi Aboluwarin (CTO of Nomba, formerly Kudi before its rebrand), YC\u2019s biggest impact has been more business-focused.\n\nAfter working on Releaf on the side during college, YC\u2019s $120k investment helped Nzewi and his co-founders go into business full time.\n\n\u201cOur previous business model was focused on attracting investment into Africa\u2019s agricultural sector, but YC pushed us to go into the market and learn things first-hand,\u201d he reveals.\n\nReleaf has recently focused on building the core technology infrastructure to power agricultural production in Nigeria.\n\nFor Aboluwarin, the learning process helped Nomba identify and focus on the most important metrics early on.\n\n\u201cThis has been a part of our culture till date and helps us keep our eyes on the nombas (pun intended). While it sounds trivial, it is easy to slip into the state of \u2018playing startup\u2019 without being conscious of actual value delivered to customers and shareholders,\u201d Pelumi explains.\n\nAboluwarin\u2019s reference to \u2018playing startup\u2019 points to a scenario we uncovered in our piece referenced above \u2014 founders shunning actively growing a business to focus on just fundraising.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them, Wave and Flutterwave, reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Their headline-grabbing stories show investor attraction for YC-backed companies.\n\nHowever, 60% of the total funding for YC-backed African startups has come from just four startups \u2014 Flutterwave ($474.5m), Wave ($200m), Thrive Agric ($56.8m), and Reliance Health (48.3m).\n\nSince our data show that 80% of YC-backed African startups have raised less than $10m, Nzewi and Aboluwarin\u2019s viewpoints lend further credence to our discussion.\n\nIn the past decade (2010-2019), 41% of Nigerian startups that cumulatively raised over $1m went through an accelerator. Chief among them were Y Combinator and Techstars, whose alumni had raised a combined $87.7m as of 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile such numbers prove success via an accelerator, 59% of startups that raised over $1m in the past decade didn\u2019t go through an accelerator.\n\n\u201cNot getting into YC doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad company,\u201d said Kyanne Kassiri, Venture partner at Lateral Capital, in a 2021 tweet. \u201cGetting into YC doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a good company,\u201d he added.\n\nMlambo explains that YC is not a magic pill, \u201cyou only get out of it what you put in. It will not magically make your business viable, nor will it guarantee that you hire the best talent in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that accelerators are just one of the several possible weapons in a founder\u2019s arsenal.\n\nNzewi maintains that getting into YC shouldn\u2019t be an end in itself for up and coming founders.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to be clear on why you want to join the programme and the business goals it will support you to achieve. That way, you can be more strategic about how you navigate the process,\u201d he explains.\n\nInterestingly, YC\u2019s considerable influence apparently has ripple effects.\n\nThe startup game is changing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case we haven\u2019t mentioned up to this point, some of Africa\u2019s most successful startup stories have come from Y Combinator alumni.\n\nPaystack was acquired by Stripe (another YC alumnus) in 2020, and the Flutterwave is possibly Africa\u2019s most valuable private company. With such crown jewels, it shouldn\u2019t surprise you to see a significant influence on other startup founders, VCs, and accelerators.\n\nAdesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier / SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital, reminds us that the YC process has, directly and indirectly, influenced the documentation and incorporation processes for African startups.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, you will find that many of the African companies have US-registered vehicles, which today is a broad expectation if you\u2019re looking to raise international venture funding,\u201d he adds.\n\nFor context, before YC agrees to invest in your startup, you\u2019d have to incorporate in Delaware, and they\u2019d help you set things up. It\u2019s no coincidence that many African startups that have raised significant funding are incorporated outside the continent.\n\nFun fact: Barring Interswitch, all of Africa\u2019s unicorns \u2014 Flutterwave, Chipper Cash, Andela, OPay \u2014 are incorporated outside the continent; the same applies to the publicly traded Jumia.\n\nMallforAfrica (now defunct), whose launch predates YC\u2019s Africa activities, was incorporated in the UK, so we can\u2019t exactly say YC encouraged a strange practice. But the accelerator has apparently made it more popular.\n\n\u201cNot that anything is wrong with being US-incorporated in itself, but it\u2019s important to note that this also brings the added need to have financial, legal, and other service counterparts in the US given the requirements that come with being US-incorporated,\u201d Solanke adds.\n\nHe, however, reckons that this practice could come with unforeseen challenges, like Mercury\u2019s recent decision to freeze the accounts of several African startups with arguably weak justifications.\n\nSolanke reveals that YC is also influencing the processes for African VC firms, particularly in setting the baseline expectations of documentation requirements they now adopt in assessing investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt is also not uncommon to see some funds use the YC process as an initial screening layer for what goes into the funnel that they assess for potential investment opportunities or encourage their early-stage companies to join prominent accelerator programmes like YC,\u201d he concludes.\n\nThe ripple effects can also be found in startup valuations and the industries that get the most funding.\n\nIn several ways, YC alone is not responsible for these trends. Incubators like CcHUB, talent development companies like Andela, and technology-focused media have shaped the continent\u2019s startup landscape in diverse ways.\n\nUnlike most things, change is permanent, so we have to ask, what are the various ways startups evolving, and what would be the drivers of those changes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "title": "How to give back to the African continent, the Bantaba way",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of my favourite lines from Jidenna\u2019s 85 to Africa project is from the song Worth the Weight. The song features Seun Kuti, and the following monologue from the artiste probably captures some of what community-driven platform, Bantaba is doing.\n\n\u201cI believe it is time for an African people-powered highway. A highway that will connect the diaspora and the motherland. A global highway for African people all over the world to rediscover themselves and remember that the only thing that unites black people globally, the only thing we have in common, is that we are from Africa.\u201d\n\nWhen most of us hear the word diaspora, what comes to mind is in-laws or relatives abroad. For some, this could mean gifts like clothes, toys, jewellery, or money (the holy grail), which we sometimes like to call remittances.\n\nLast year, people in the diaspora sent back $45 billion to family members and friends, and this amount depicts how much money comes into the African continent annually. Interestingly, despite World Bank predictions stating a possible 20% decline for low and middle-income countries due to the pandemic, that year, remittances declined by only 1.6%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn some countries like The Gambia, Lesotho, and Cape Verde, these remittances contribute considerably to their GDP.\n\nBut let\u2019s circle back to how these remittances come about. Many diasporans leave their country in search of better jobs and opportunities. Although some go to get an education, we could estimate that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre is almost always the former.\n\nIn the long run, this means that depending on the type of job and the length of stay, these diasporans attain some level of experience. Some of them work with big tech companies like Facebook, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, and some work with investment banks or companies.\n\nEssentially, there is a well of largely untapped diasporan knowledge.\n\nAt Bantaba, Lamin K. Darboe and his team of diasporans (and non-diasporans) are looking for ways to ensure this wealth of knowledge and cash trickles down to African tech startups that need them.\n\nOne of such diasporans is Pierre Jallow, a Gambian and the Founder and CEO of Webridge, a company that connects Nordic/Baltic businesses to the African market and vice versa. He is also the Co-founder of Remode, an entry-level accelerator.\n\nBut before his life in tech, Jallow was a professional basketball player. He moved around quite a bit and played in Finland (his current homeland) before moving to Russia and then back to Finland.\n\nThe way Jallow sees it, Bantaba is helping to expand the Ubuntu philosophy of \u201cI am because we are\u201d, which, for most people, has come to mean doing right by their family, tribe or community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you don\u2019t have to say, \u2018Okay, my remittances are only going to my parents or people in my family\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m just going to keep my investments in Europe where it\u2019s not going to develop locally.\u2019But you are saying with my $10, $20k, I\u2019m going to invest in a due-diligence ready company, in a vetted company. That is the platform that Bantaba gives these investors.\u201d\n\nThe journey to Bantaba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLamin K. Darboe. CEO and Co-founder of Bantaba\n\nWhen Darboe left the shores of Gambia for India in 2012, it wasn\u2019t because he had dreams of founding a startup. Far from that, in fact. Like most young people \u2014 sometimes a little older \u2014 leaving Africa, Darboe left to get an education.\n\nBut his journey to India would lead him to Italy.\n\n\u201cDuring the same year, I had another scholarship offer from a University in Milan, Italy, and that\u2019s how I moved to Italy, where I completed my undergraduate [studies] in finance. And then, like many finance graduates, the choice was maybe investment banking or consulting. So I tried to follow one of those routes.\u201d\n\nThat would take him to Ireland and then back to Italy, a decision that would introduce him to the startup world.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I was working with a partner who was an angel investor and had investments in many tech startups in Northern Italy.\u201d\n\nIn August 2019, Darboe moved to Stockholm for an MSc at the Stockholm School of Economics.\n\nIn June 2020, he met three other African students \u2014 Fabrice Ouedraogo, Eliane Birba, and Noufou Kafando \u2014 in a climate action challenge organised by Norrsken Foundation and Stockholm Innovation & Growth (Sting).\n\nAlthough they would eventually crash out, the stage had been set for future collaborations, and the current result is Bantaba.\n\nThe way Darboe explains it, Bantaba match makes diasporans with tech experience and who want to give back to the African continent through startups looking to raise capital, cultivate mentorship relationships, or receive consulting services.\n\nA way to think of this is by using the meaning of Bantaba. It\u2019s an ancient Manding word used to describe a large tree in the village square under which elders came to discuss things that affected everyone in the village.\n\nLikening this to the digital platform, Darboe describes Bantaba as a square-like convergence of the diaspora and tech startups to \u201caddress the challenges back home.\u201d\n\nWhat Bantaba is not\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we\u2019ve established what Bantaba is, what should you not mistake Bantaba for?\n\nFirst off, while it has similarities to (in)famous matchmaking platform, Tinder, in terms of matching tech startups in need of professional advice and funding with diasporans who can provide those things, finding love is not the goal. Darboe finds the idea \u201csexy,\u201d but unfortunately, not entirely representative of all Bantaba does.\n\nSide note: If you find love while using Bantaba, please reach out; I love to hear such stories.\n\nIt is also not LinkedIn. Although it creates a community of professionals, it is more focused on the diaspora and tech startups, a positive which Darboe believes can open room for monetisation in the future.\n\nAnother thought to scratch off the list is an accelerator or an incubator. Bantaba is none of those things, and while it does allow startups to create the kind of relationships you\u2019d get with those, it has a different approach.\n\nAlso, it is not strictly a platform to raise money. While that option exists, it is not the primary offering. Like the typical funding round, money is exchanged for equity. However, like GetEquity, a cap is placed on how much is raised. There is, however, no official market for secondaries.\n\nHowever, like with most community-centred apps, each user has a profile. But, before it is created, the startups and diasporans go through a vetting process to ensure that all is well. All the data provided is used to match startups and diasporans with similar needs.\n\nBantaba also provides Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Miro credits to startups on the platform based on the partnerships it has with these companies.\n\nIn the end, the idea was birthed out of Darboe and his co-founders\u2019 interests in engaging with the African continent, bridging the gap between the diaspora and the tech community, while building a community of experts and potential investors.\n\nCurrently, Bantaba takes a 5% fee off any successful funding deal they are directly involved in. This means that if a startup joined the platform to raise money and Bantaba matched them with an investor who proceeds to give them money, Bantaba makes money off this.\n\nWhile I wonder how sustainable this would be in the long run, Tomiwa Onaleye, Bantaba\u2019s Content Strategist, tells me the end goal is to earn enough money to \u201ckeep the company\u2019s lights on.\u201d\n\nThis is doubly tricky when you realise that a startup can make these connections on its own on the platform and possibly get funding without Bantaba knowing. But Onaleye says they are not necessarily bothered about that.\n\nSo far, Bantaba has raised $425,000 in pre-seed funding from Swedish angel investors. For subsequent rounds and keeping with their current business model, Onaleye says the company is in no rush to bring just any kind of investor on board.\n\nBut are there plans to open up the platform to non-diasporans?\n\nAlthough Darboe doesn\u2019t rule out this possibility, he makes a statement reminiscent of our introductory anecdote: \u201cI believe it is time for an African people-powered highway.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is a good way for Africans to be part of their own development before you bring in other people.\u201d\n\nAnd Jallow agrees.\n\n\u201cNo country was developed by others. Every country in this world was developed by its own people. Whether you consider one of the countries in Europe or North America, they were developed by their own people.\n\n\u201cAnd the same goes for the African continent and the countries within the continent, and if its own people don\u2019t get up, we don\u2019t develop it. And I think this is the chance Bantaba creates.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Blockchain is Africa\u2019s chance to play a vital role in developing one of the world\u2019s transformative technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored by Nairaex, winners of the Hackathon will go home with a total of $2,500 distributed to the first ($1,250), second ($750), and third ($500) placed finalists.\n\nWith an in-house team sifting through several registered teams, we have chosen the six finalists for the TABS Web3 Hackathon.\n\nThe teams were chosen based on the originality and uniqueness of their proposed solutions for the Hackathon. They will meet with the judges virtually in the next round, pitch their solutions, and get feedback on the best way to build them.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon finalists\n\nTeam Momoh Victor: Blockchain for financial inclusion\n\nTeam Momoh Victor\u2019s solution is a blockchain-powered system \u201cthat allows anyone who has a smartphone to create an account and a physical card for themselves and their loved ones.\u201d\n\nLed by Oluwatobi Babalola, the team is bullish on the possibility of building products that could aid financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nTeam Give: Credit facility for minting NFTs\n\nLed by Opeyemin Ajayi, Team Give wants to make minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) easier for those that do not have the resources to do so. Minting an NFT on Ethereum could cost between $70 and $300, and Team Give wants to create a credit facility that takes care of the cost of minting NFTs while you repay with interest.\n\nTeam ThrushBolt: Helping emerging talented artistes, music producers, and DJs to monetise their work with NFTs\n\nTeam ThrushBolt is also building an NFT-related solution for music. According to the team, talented artistes, music producers, and DJs can go beyond \u201cearning minute fractions of pennies per stream on platforms like Spotify\u201d to earning big with NFTs.\n\nLed by Agbo Ebuka, the Team TrushBolt wants to revolutionise how musicians earn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam Chemotronix: Blockchain for green energy\n\nPeace Bello is the team lead for Team Chemotronix. The team plans to use blockchain to solve climate-related problems.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to solve the current climate crisis issue. Blockchain would help secure net-zero investments by offering certifications for the green hydrogen market.\u201d\n\nTeam JPS: NFT market for digital fashion assets\n\nTeam JPS is merging blockchain with eCommerce but for virtual fashion accessories.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering who will buy fashion accessories they can\u2019t wear, Team JPS, led by Promise Adesemoye, has an exciting approach to its solution.\n\nThe solution is to \u201ccreate a marketplace for digital fashion assets which people can use for their social media by simulating on their pictures while also retaining the same value as an NFT.\u201d\n\nCould this also morph into fashion assets for avatars in the metaverse? I guess we\u2019ll find out at TABS 2022. Save a seat for yourself here.\n\nTeam Block baddies\n\nKhadijah Wraola Amusat hopes to lead Team Block baddies to victory with a solution that could help writers and authors get top dollar for their work.\n\nThey want to help authors list their books for sale in a marketplace like OpenSea but for books and articles.\n\nAccording to the Block baddies, \u201cthese books will be stored as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), meaning no one else can list or sell these books. Secondly, they would need permission from the owner before transferring it to another wallet account.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the books and articles can only be accessed on the blockchain, ruling out transfers by Bluetooth or email and making it impossible to duplicate after purchase.\n\nOur judges will select the best three solutions and decide which teams go home with the first, second, and third place cash prizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

These days, businesses strive to reach a global audience, leveraging the power of technology to achieve results. However, despite the efforts of businesses (both small and large scale) to tap into the potential of borderless transactions, they have continually faced a series of challenges, prominent among them are the exorbitant charges of traditional banks and fintechs, and the unfavourable fluctuation in value of national currencies. This is especially true for businesses in emerging markets across Africa, Asia, South America, and the rest of the world. This is without considering the periodic shifts and changes to governmental regulations in these countries.\n\nAs a way out, IvoryPay aims to help businesses, merchants, and creators maximise gains by providing them with an alternative route to making and receiving payments. Built on the Solana blockchain, IvoryPay\u2019s aim is to help online businesses facilitate bankless transactions through cryptocurrency. With IvoryPay, businesses in emerging markets will be able to reduce the cost of transacting, increase transaction processing and payment confirmation speed, and accept payments in stable currencies.\n\nThe IvoryPay ecosystem comprises three components which include the Ivorypay payment gateway solution, the NFT Storefront, and the IVRY token. The payment gateway infrastructure helps online businesses easily accept payment in stablecoins and the IVRY token, offering customers the option to make payments using the most convenient means. Businesses on IvoryPay can accept payments using QR codes, checkout integrations, payment links, and buttons. The NFT Storefront will provide digital creators and businesses the opportunity to better monetize and diversify their revenue stream. Creators can choose from pre-existing templates to easily set up their storefront and be operational in no time, with an integrated payment system that allows them to sell the NFTs seamlessly. The IVRY token, which is the native cryptocurrency of the project will be used as a means of exchange between customers and merchants and it will also be used for staking purposes.\n\nThe idea to create an alternative means of payment facilitation that birthed IvoryPay was conceived by Oluwatobi Ajayi and Ope Akinremi, who are also Co founders of Uptrend Africa, one the biggest crypto marketing agencies in Africa championing grassroot cryptocurrency adoption. Oluwatobi who has worked in the crypto/alternative payment space over the past couple of years is of the belief that \u201cglobal businesses have reached a point where the barriers to trade should be non-existent and payment solutions should present businesses with multiple options with the end goal of simplifying payment processes and enhancing user experience without the need to break a sweat or empty your pocket in the process\u201d.\n\nOpe further added that \u201cconsumers are the backbone of the global economy and it is the foremost responsibility of all forward-thinking businesses to be in tune with the demands of their consumers. Thinking forward, in this case, would imply offering users the means to make payment in the manner they find most convenient, and trendy\u201d.\n\nWith the project in its development phase, it is only a matter of time before Ivorypay launches its robust payment architecture. The project could be a game-changer for online businesses in emerging markets and global commerce as a whole.\n\nFor more information, you can visit www.ivorypay.io.

          "text": "Continuous Voters Registration to end soon- INEC \u2026as CSOs charge INEC to do more to improve on the conduct of Ekiti election\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said the on-going continous voters registration exercise nationwide will be ending soon. He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Remember that it is about food and nutritional security, the well-being of our farmers, improved income and less use of chemical sprays for environmental sustainability,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the safety of the improved PBR Cowpea, the director-general, National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, assured Nigerians the crop is safe for both human consumption and the environment.\n\nHe stressed that the PBR, genetically-modified with a non-harmful substance sourced from the soil (Bacillus Thuringiensis) that resists insect attacks and infestation of the staple food, was subjected to several rigorous risks analysis and safety tests by the Federal Government before approval for public consumption.\n\nAlso, the country coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology OFAB, Nigeria chapter, Dr. Rose Gidado, said Nigeria has etched her place in the comity of nations with the commercialisation of the PBR Cowpea. Nigeria\u2019s action, she said, has caused other African nations to come learn from her success. She stressed there is no difference between the conventional cowpea and the modified one. \u201cApart from being resistant to insects, they share the same characteristics in taste, colour, texture etc.\u201d",

          "text": "The National Executive Council (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has opted to throw the contest for its presidential ticket open rather than zone it to a particular region of the country.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Debo Ologunagba, announced this decision on Wednesday while briefing reporters at the party\u2019s secretariat in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) after the NEC meeting.\n\nHe informed reporters that the decision was part of the resolutions reached at the end of the 96th PDP NEC meeting, which was well attended by various party leaders.\n\n\u201cAfter a very extensive deliberation, NEC aligned with the recommendation of the PDP National Zoning Committee that the presidential election should now be left open. The Party should also work towards consensus candidate where possible,\u201d the communique read in part.\n\n\u201cNEC noted the recommendation of the Zoning Committee that in the interest of justice and fair play, the Party should take decision on Zoning timeously so as to prevent complications to the process.\u201d\n\nDate For Presidential Primary\n\nAt the meeting, the PDP NEC also adopted a date for its presidential primary and special national convention and chose former Senate President David Mark to head the organising committee.\n\n\u201cNEC ratified the conduct of the Presidential Primary (Special National Convention) to elect our Party\u2019s Presidential Candidate on Saturday, May 28 to Sunday, May 29, 2022, in Abuja,\u201d the communique said.\n\n\u201cNEC approved the setting up of the National Convention Organizing Committee and approved the appointment of His Excellency, Senator David Mark as Chairman, His Excellency Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as Deputy Chairman and His Excellency Barr. Ibrahim Shema as Secretary.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s NEC gave the assurance of free, fair, credible, and transparent processes for the emergence of its candidates for all elective positions in the 2023 general elections.\n\nRead the full communique below:\n\nCommunique Issued at the End of the 96th National Executive Committee (NEC) Meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Held Today, Wednesday, May 11, 2022, at the PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Wuse Zone 5, Abuja\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) of our great Party at its 96th meeting extensively deliberated on urgent national issues as well as the preparation of our Party for the 2023 general elections and resolved as follows:\n\n1. NEC commended the dedication of the National Working Committee (NWC) under the Chairmanship of Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu in effectively piloting the affairs of our Party, particularly in the organization of processes preparatory to the 2023 general elections.\n\n2. NEC restated its confidence in the ability of the NWC to lead our Party to victory in the 2023 general elections.\n\n3. NEC applauded other organs of the Party; namely the Board of Trustees (BoT), the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, the National Assembly Caucus, the Zonal and State Organs of the Party, our structure at various levels, critical stakeholders and teeming members across the country for their efforts in strengthening our Party in the mission to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the misrule of the APC.\n\n4. NEC commended the NWC for the deft handling of issues relating to the conduct and outcome of our Party Congresses at various levels preparatory to the election of candidates for various elective positions in the 2023 general elections.\n\n5. NEC applauded the spirit of sportsmanship being exhibited by our leaders, critical stakeholders, aspirants and party members on issues relating to our Congresses.\n\nOn the State of the nation\n\n6. NEC strongly decried the worsening insecurity and continued killing of innocent Nigerians by terrorists who are emboldened by the exposed refusal of the APC-led government to confront the terrorists even when it knows their locations, listens to their phone conversations and even aware of their plans.\n\n7. NEC Condemned the failure/refusal of the APC government to rescue our citizens still languishing in their abductors\u2019 dens including victims of last month\u2019s terrorism attack on the Abuja/Kaduna train. NEC urged the Federal Government to live up to its Constitutional duty to secure life and property and ensure an unconditional release of all the abductees.\n\n8. NEC expressed dismay that our security command and control coordination structure has collapsed under President Muhammadu Buhari as Mr. President remains \u201cabsent\u201d having abdicated his duties as Commander-in-Chief and surrendering sovereignty over a substantial part of our country to terrorists.\n\n9. NEC further condemned the humongous corruption and deliberate economic manipulations in the APC Government which have crippled our productive sector and resulted in the unbearable high cost of food items and other essential goods and services with consequential excruciating economic hardship to our citizens.\n\n10. NEC rejected the continuing closure of public universities in Nigeria due to the refusal/failure of the APC government to decisively address the lingering industrial action by lecturers in public universities despite the huge resources at its disposal. It cautioned the APC to stop playing with the emotions, destiny and future of our youths and take action to address the industrial action immediately so that our children can go back to their classes.\n\n11. NEC condemned in very strong terms the mass looting of our national treasury and diversion of public funds through orchestrated purchase of APC Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms by all manner of persons at excessive N100 million to warehouse slush funds for APC to rig the 2023 general elections. We restate our demand to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate all APC Presidential aspirants in this regard.\n\n12. NEC restated the call by the Party for the immediate resignation, arrest and prosecution of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for alleged manipulations and financial impropriety in the CBN which contributed to the collapse of our national economy.\n\n13. NEC vehemently rejected the continued stay of Mr. Emefiele as CBN Governor after being confirmed as a card-carrying member of the APC. The CBN is the custodian and keeper of all INEC sensitive materials used in all elections. Having been confirmed as a member of the APC, Mr. Emefiele, can no longer be trusted with INEC sensitive materials which are key to the guarantee of free, fair and credible elections.\n\n14. NEC assures Nigerians that the PDP is resolute in taking very firm legitimate series of action in the march to restore and protect the sanctity of our Central Bank and electoral process\n\nZoning:\n\n15. After a very extensive deliberation NEC aligned with the recommendation of the PDP National Zoning Committee that the Presidential Election should now be left open. The Party should also work towards consensus candidate where possible.\n\nNEC noted the recommendation of the Zoning Committee that in the interest of justice and fair play, the Party should take decision on Zoning timeously so as to prevent complications to the process.\n\nPresidential Primary and National Convention\n\n16. NEC ratified the conduct of the Presidential Primary (Special National Convention) to elect our Party\u2019s Presidential Candidate on Saturday May 28 to Sunday May 29, 2022 in Abuja\n\n17. NEC approved the setting up of the National Convention Organizing Committee and approved the appointment of His Excellency, Senator David Mark as Chairman, His Excellency Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as Deputy Chairman and His Excellency Barr. Ibrahim Shema as Secretary.\n\n18. NEC assured of free, fair, credible and transparent processes for the emergence of our Party\u2019s Candidates for all elective positions in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThank you.\n\nHon. Debo Ologunagba\n\nNational Publicity Secretary\n\nCalls for zoning jettisoned\n\nPrior to the meeting, there were expectations that the party would zone its presidential ticket to the southern part of the country and there were calls by party leaders and supporters for it to do just that.\n\nTo determine what to do about the calls, on March 24, the PDP\u2019s National Working Committee inaugurated a zoning committee led by Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom.\n\nThe committee was tasked with the responsibility of ensuring fair distribution of the party\u2019s elective offices across the country. It concluded its sittings on April 5 but was silent on its recommendation.\n\nFour days later, southern governors elected on the platform of the party demanded that the presidential ticket be zoned to the region.\n\nThey kicked against the reports that the zoning committee had recommended an open contest for the top post, arguing that doing so would be deemed unjust and must be rescinded.\n\nTheir demand was not granted as NEC has decided to make it an open contest, opening the door for all those who have shown interest in running for the country\u2019s top position on the party\u2019s platform.\n\nSo, far Nigerians from the north and south have indicated an interest in the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nAmong those aspiring for the ticket are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto, and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi.",

According to her, it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike said that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f), and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that government appointees vying for elective positions were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the poll.\n\nJustice Anyadike said that any law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null, and void to the extent of its inconsistency with the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nFollowing the move, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria Femi Falana faulted the decision. He argued that \u201cthe learned trial judge fell into a great error\u201d.\n\nBefore the ruling, the Senate rejected President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for the amendment of the controversial section.\n\nThe Senators kicked against it and voted no when put to voice votes by the Senate President Ahmad Lawan during plenary in March.",
