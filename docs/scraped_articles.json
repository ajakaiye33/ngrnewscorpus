That\u2019s not the reason why we went there.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju had surgery, it is simply proper etiquette or behaviour both in the part of the country where I come from but also generally that when a friend and elder is undergoing health challenges, it would be improper on your part not to show solidarity and support.\n\n\u201cThat is simply what took us there; we wanted to associate ourselves with him at a time of need and as an elder, as a mentor and as a big figure in our political party, nothing wrong in paying him a courtesy visit to check on him to see how he was faring and we did that and we returned.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with 2023; let me make that absolutely clear.\u201d\n\nTinubu\u2019s health has been a subject of controversy of late.\n\nAt least over 30 politicians have visited Tinubu, in London, in the last two months. Notably amongst the politicians include the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Kano State Governor, Umar Ganduje; Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun; as well as Fayemi and Akeredolu.\n\nOthers who also visited Tinubu in London include House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; ex-Governor of Ogun State and current Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun; former Governor of Borno State and current Senator representing Borno Central, Kashim Shettima.\n\nTinubu, who celebrated his 69th birthday in March 2021 and command an arguably large following of political loyalists, has been rumoured to nurse presidential ambition in 2023.\n\nIn recent years, the UK has become a choice destination for the Nigerian elite including the President, who frequent London for medical tourism while perpetual industrial actions, lack of modern equipment, failure of government to pay doctors\u2019 salaries, amongst others, mar Nigeria\u2019s health sector.",

          "text": "Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Kayode Fayemi, says only God knows what his political future holds in the 2023 general elections.\n\nFayemi made this known on Sunday when he spoke on THISDAY Live, an interview programme on Arise Television monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nFayemi\u2019s presidential campaign posters had gone viral in August 2020 and had sparked public debate on various social media platforms regarding the possibility of his candidacy in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe sponsor of the posters and Chairman of Ikere Council area of Ekiti State, Femi Ayodele, had said he did the posters, with the campaign message, \u2018Support His Excellency Dr John Kayode Fayemi for President 2023\u2019 \u201cto show my unalloyed and uncompromising loyalty to Governor Fayemi\u201d to dispel speculations that he was working against him.\n\nBut the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Yinka Oyebode, had said that his principal did not know anything about the posters.\n\n\u201cThe sponsor is merely expressing a personal opinion,\u201d he had said.\n\nAyodele was later directed to \u201cstep aside\u201d by the Ekiti State House of Assembly over alleged unauthorised viral campaign poster seeking support for Fayemi\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nBut when asked on Sunday whether he would be running for President in 2023, Fayemi said, \u201cI have a job to do; I want to finish well as governor of Ekiti State, I want to do more to put Ekiti on the pedestal of growth and development in the period that is left for me in office.\n\n\u201cWhat the future holds, God knows, but we will cross that bridge when we get there. For now, my primary responsibility is Ekiti State.\u201d\n\nThe governor also predicted victory for his party, the All Progressives Congress, in 2023.\n\nHe said, \u201cContentions are always going to happen. APC is a big party with different tendencies and there will be contentions for and against. We are very confident that this party will produce the next government in this country in 2023 but before we get there, we are more focused on the country now. The party is more interested in the stability and security of Nigeria. What is happening internally is something we will resolve internally.\u201d\n\nWith the 2023 elections fast approaching, there have been political posturings and permutations as to the next presidential candidate of the APC and opposition Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nThe 17 Southern Governors including Fayemi had also demanded that the next President should emerge from Southern Nigeria after the eight-year regime of the incumbent, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who is from Katsina State, North-West Nigeria.\n\nThe PUNCH recently reported that Salihu Yakasai, a former Special Adviser on Media to Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, listed APC chieftains who have the ability to win the next presidential election to include APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; as well as Fayemi.\n\nFayemi was first Ekiti State governor from October 2010 to October 2014. He was later appointed Minister of Solid Minerals Development by Buhari and was in office between November 2015 and May 2018 before he was re-elected as the governor of Ekiti State in October 2018. The 56-year-old is expected to hand over power in October 2022 to a democratically elected successor.",

          "text": "The Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Universities Teaching Hospitals Research Institutes and Associated Institutions (SSAUTHRIAI) have opined that the persistent industrial actions in the country are largely due to the non-implementation of agreements by the government.\n\nThe General Secretary of NASU, Peters Adeyemi, stated this to newsmen on Sunday, in Abuja, saying that the non-implementation of agreements reached with unions in research institutions 10 years ago with government officials to fulfill the terms of agreements.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have had to contend with the problem of government and employers of labour in our country abdicating their responsibility and refusing to honour signed agreements.\u201d\n\nAdeyemi blamed the number of industrial crises that had occurred in Nigeria as a result of the refusal of the Federal Government to faithfully implement agreements that they freely entered into with the unions.\n\nImo NASU tasks FG to approve special salary scheme for staff, embarks on protest\n\nHe observed that it is becoming problematic because every day, the government signs a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and Memorandum of Agreements (MoA).\n\nThe General Secretary of NASU explained that it seems, to a large extent, that such actions are nothing but a fire brigade approach on the part of the Federal Government to get striking workers back to work.\n\nHe said that the government sign these MoUs and MoAs knowing fully well that they are not going to do anything to address the grievances of the unions, alleging that the Federal Government does not even know the number of MoUs and MoAs they have signed in recent times.\n\nHe insisted that the implication of the path the government has adopted would only lead to many more strikes, saying that the unions would be legitimately right for prosecuting a strike.\n\nHe lamented that the moment they (unions) obtained these agreements, they go back to their members in good faith and the strike is suspended, lamenting that many months after that, nothing happens and a new set of agitations will then begin.\n\nAdeyemi explained that the insertion of timelines in agreements was meant to ensure adherence to an implementation timetable, however, regretted that this had not also helped the situation.\n\nIncidentally, he noted that even when timelines are attached to these agreements, it does not serve as a motivation to do anything, adding that they have had agreements where timelines of six weeks were agreed upon.\n\nThe General Secretary of NASU noted that but nothing happen after six months and even six years, showing clearly that the Federal Government willingly enters into agreements knowing fully well it is not committed to doing anything.\n\nAlso, the President of SSAUTHRIAI, Mr Akintola Benjamin, while reacting to the issue, explained that the Federal Government had shown a lackadaisical attitude to respecting signed agreements.\n\nHe said the issues in contention included the withdrawal of circular on non-skipping of salary grade level 10.\n\nHe added that although the unions in the research sub-sector secured a judgment for the implementation of the non-skipping, the Federal Government was yet to implement the policy service-wide, but implemented it only in a few ministries.\n\nHe observed, \u201cWe are saying that the judgment should be implemented service-wide so that it will cut across the entire 14 ministries where research institutes are.\u201d\n\nMr Akintola Benjamin lamented that the non-implementation of the retirement age of 65 years, as applicable in the Nigerian universities, in the research institutions, was another issue.\n\nIn the universities, he noted that the retirement age is 65 years for both academic and non-academic staff, stressing that the scheme that the research institutes run is the same as that of the universities while the Colleges of Education and Polytechnics are enjoying the 65 years retirement age.\n\nHe said that they are asking that both research and non-research staffers should also enjoy 65 years of retirement age, saying that the academic staff in research institutes are already enjoying this.\n\nMr Akintola Benjamin noted that they are saying it should be extended to all the staff, in order to stem migration from research institutes to other sub-sectors.\n\nHe said there is the need for the establishment of a regulatory body to be known as the National Research Institutes\u2019 Commission (NARICOM) as we have National Universities Commission (NUC) for the universities and National Commission for Colleges of Education and others.\n\nHe added that they are agitating for inadequate funding of research instituted and are also demanding that research should enjoy specialised funding in order to encourage research activities. We are also seeking a review of our conditions of service.\n\nHe noted that they have worked on it and submitted it to the Federal Government, but it has not taken any action on it, adding that the one they released to them was manipulated so they rejected it and are now calling on the government to release the agreed version to us.\n\nAkintola stated that the recent 15-day ultimatum, which was issued based on the same demands made on Sept.10, is due to expire on September 27, and the Federal Government is yet to respond to it.\n\nBuhari govt looking for trouble \u2013 NASU warns against workers\u2019 pay cut",

          "text": "A former Commissioner for Lands and Survey in Benue State, Surv. John Tondo, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to make immediate arrangements to take the ongoing Continuous Voters\u2019 Registration exercise to all the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps hosting Nigerian citizens from Uvir, Mbadwem, Mbabai, Mbayer-Yandev, Mbawa, and Nyiev Council Wards of Guma Local Government Area in Benue State.\n\nTondo, in a statement released on Monday, said it would be very much appreciated if registration centres for the physical registration of voters are located in the IDP camps in Benue State.\n\nAccording to him, this is the only way to guarantee that the IDPs are given the opportunity of exercising their franchise in the forthcoming elections so that they can freely choose their political representatives.\n\nHe further threatened to take legal actions if no special arrangements to register and include in the voters\u2019 register every Nigerian citizen from the aforementioned Council Wards in the IDPs camps in Benue State are put in place by INEC within 21 days.\n\n\u201cI have the mandate of the aforesaid internally displaced persons and my people, in general, to bring to your immediate attention for necessary action, the fact that the IDP Camps in Benue State and their inhabitants are being completely shut out of our country\u2019s political process because they are not part of the on-going continuous voters\u2019 registration exercise.\n\n\u201cAs you are well aware, voting and being voted for are at the heart of the democratic system of government. The rights to vote and to be voted for also constitute inalienable human rights recognized by the Nigerian Constitution and the African Charter of Human and People\u2019s Rights. It is in furtherance of these rights that the extant Electoral Act provides for continuous voters\u2019 registration and constant updating of the Voters\u2019 Register by INEC.\n\n\u201cAs you are also aware, many Nigerian citizens of resident in Benue State origin were forced into various IDP Camps within the State because of frequent bloody internal conflicts which occasioned the prevailing climate of insecurity in the State.\n\n\u201dYou would agree with me that those persons unfortunately displaced from their homes are still entitled to vote and be voted for, notwithstanding their current residential status. It is INEC that bears the constitutional and statutory responsibilities of ensuring that Nigerians of voting age, including the internally displaced persons, are registered as voters and are not disenfranchised through the discriminatory implementation of INEC policies.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that in the run-up to the 2019 General Elections, eligible voters in the IDP Camps in the State were not afforded the opportunity to participate in the continuous voters\u2019 registration, and thus were unable to exercise their franchise during the Elections.\n\n\u201cNow, the INEC is conducting another voters\u2019 registration for purposes of the 2023 General Elections, and once again persons eligible for registration as voters but who currently reside in the IDP Camps are being excluded from the process as no special arrangement whatsoever has been made to ensure their registration as voters and the inclusion of their names in the updated Voters\u2019 Register.\n\n\u201cFacilities to enable online registration are non-existent in the IDP Camps at the moment. Even if such facilities were to be made available in the IDP Camps, it is a known fact that the level of illiteracy, including computer \u2013 illiteracy, is very high in Nigeria. It could be safely estimated that 75% to 80% of those in the IDP Camps in Benue State are illiterates who would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to manipulate smartphones or computers in order to fill online soft-copies of the requisite forms to initiate or conclude their voters\u2019 registration process.\n\n\u201dFigures from relevant agencies of government in Benue State indicate that there are about 36,000 internally displaced persons in the Guma camp alone, even as independent sources suggest the figure could, indeed, be far higher.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m writing this petition on behalf of the IDPs from the following Council Wards in Guma Local Government Area: Uvir, Mbadwem, Mbabai, Mbayer-Yandev, Mbawa, and Nyiev, who were sacked from their homes by armed marauders and for a long time they have been living in IDPs camps in Benue State.\n\n\u201cIf no special arrangements are put in place by INEC within 21 days, we shall be constrained to have recourse to the judicial system and take legal steps to ensure that the Commission is compelled to register and include in the voters\u2019 register every Nigerian citizen from the aforementioned Council Wards in the IDP Camps in Benue State,\u201d the petition read.\n\nHowever, when contacted, a senior official in the Public Affairs Department of the Commission said the matter was still to be brought to the attention of the department.\n\n\u201cYou know, such things (as Tondo\u2019s petition) are normally addressed to the Chairman and when they come to the Chairman, he would minute them to the department in charge of Voter Registration. So, the best bet is to check with the voter registration,\u201d he said.",

Whereas some rich countries are already talking of third booster shots, many low and middle-income countries have not even given one shot to their citizens.\n\n\u201cAdded to this is the restriction placed on the citizens from certain countries by the rich nations. These restrictions, made possible by the use of \u201dvaccine passports\u201d, as well as the low level of vaccination in the low and middle-income countries due to \u2018vaccine rationalism\u2019 that has seen the rich ones mop up available vaccines, are capable of thwarting the efforts to restart tourism. It is therefore imperative for the rich countries of the world to retrace their steps and embrace a collective and equitable global strategy for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing, procurement, and distribution.\n\n\u201cThey must also stop ineffective nationalistic disposition in COVID-19 responses. And COVID-19 response should be science-driven, with experts in epidemiology, virology, and the social sciences (not politicians) taking the lead in devising and implementing science-based strategies to reduce the risks that the pandemic poses to the most vulnerable across the globe and to reduce transmission of this novel virus.\u201d",

          "text": "By Moses Emorinken and Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\n\u2022 We are open to dialogue, says NARD\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Federal Government on Sunday night said it has not received any official communication from resident doctors on their minimum demands for an end of their 56-day old strike.\n\nThe government however, assured that it would make its position known to the doctors once it received such communication from the striking doctors\u2019 umbrella body, the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD).\n\nNARD had at the end of its 41st Annual General Meeting (AGM) and Scientific Conference in Bauchi, Bauchi State, at the weekend asked the government to pay the salary arrears of its members on the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS)\n\nThe other conditions the association gave for its members to resume work are the payments of medical residency training fund (MRTF) for 2020 and 2021 and withheld August and September salaries; payment of the salary arrears and allowances of doctors in state tertiary health institutions and the withdrawal of the court case against it.\n\nNARD however explained yesterday that it was ready to negotiate with the Federal Government if it (government) is able to meet the 72-hour ultimatum it gave for the minimum conditions to be met.\n\nWhen contacted by The Nation, Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige said\u201d \u201cWe have not gotten that (the 72-hour ultimatum). We have not received their new demands. Let them write their employers, the Minister of Health. Let them also write me.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen all those demands. When we see their demands we will then have an answer if it is true.\n\n\u201cThey normally send me the communique of their meeting. When we see it we will respond.\u201d\n\nNew NARD President Dare Ishaya had earlier yesterday told The Nation that he was eager to see the association\u2019s face-off with the Federal Government brought to end.\n\nIshaya disclosed that apart from discussing with the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Health Services, Dr. Tanko Sununu, he had scheduled a meeting for tomorrow with Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) President Innocent Ujah over the issues at state.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs new executives, we do not know the level of trust that existed between the NARD leadership and the government team(s).\n\n\u201cThis 72 hours ultimatum that we gave the government is for the government to extend an olive branch to the new executives of the association.\n\n\u201cWithin this 72 hours, we can sit down together, look at the issues one after the other, and then sort it out because I feel terribly bad that I am coming in to inherit a strike. Therefore, the 72 hours is so that we can iron out the issues and resume back to work.\n\n\u201cI have already scheduled a meeting with the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) President. I got to understand that there were a lot of arguments between the NMA President and my predecessor. I want us to first speak with him and look at the point of disagreement; we will therefore see if we can move together because I want the NMA and my association to work together in solving the problems. From there, we can go and see other stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe NARD boss said they would not focus on \u201cany court order because if we dwell on that, it means that we are still on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat we have seen is that there are a lot of things and technicalities that have been on the way.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the stand of the President(Muhammadu Buhari) concerning the issue, especially what came up some days back, he requested that the Ministry of Labour set aside all technicalities, which the lawsuit is one of. However, it is still there.\n\n\u201cHowever, our members are still not going back to work yet until negotiations..\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThere are indications that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is in a dilemma over the zoning of the national chairmanship ahead of its October 30 convention.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the PDP Zoning Committee as well as governors were divided on whether or not the chairmanship seat be zoned to the North or South.\n\nIt was gathered that while party leaders in the North are pushing for the party to retain the chairmanship in the South to pave the way for a northerner to clinch the PDP 2023 presidential ticket, their counterparts in the South, who have their eyes on the presidential ticket, wants the chairmanship zoned to the North.\n\nThe PDP National Executive Committee (NEC), at its meeting in Abuja, earlier in the month, had set up a committee headed by Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, to zone the position of the national chairman and other positions in the party\u2019s National Working Committee(NWC).\n\nHowever, the zoning committee, at its meeting in Enugu, last Thursday, failed to agree on how the chairmanship position and other offices should be zoned.\n\nA highly placed party source told Daily Sun that \u201cNorthern governors wants it to go the South. The southern governors wants it to go the South. There is a split in the zoning committee.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that those pushing for zoning of the chairmanship to the North are \u201cdiscountenacing the fact that the party constitution provides for second tenure for anyone holding a position. If you now zone it outside their zones, for those holding offices now, you have violated the constitution of the party. That is the argument of some stakeholders.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the South South is holding the chairman. If Secondus wants to contest and you zone the position out of the South, you have deprived him. The PDP is at a crossroad.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Daily Sun gathered that another group of party leaders are canvassing that the chairmanship contest should be thrown open to all qualified aspirants.\n\nAnother party source told Daily Sun that those canvassing for the chairmanship contest to be thrown open are arguing that it would help the PDP keep the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the dark as to where the opposition party\u2019s 2023 presidential party candidate would come from.\n\nAccording to the source \u201cthat (throwing chairmanship contest open) is the most likely thing to avoid problem. When you through it open, you have removed speculation as where the Presidency will come from.\n\n\u201cIf you say the South, they will say okay, the president will come from North. If you make it open, then in the presidential ticket, you also throw it open. But the party knows where it is going.\u201d\n\nThe Zoning Committee, barring any last minute change, is expected to meet on Thursday, to reach a compromise.\n\nThe PDP Governors Forum are expected to meet in Abuja on Wednesday over the zoning imbroglio.\n\nThe outcome of the Governors Forum meeting, it was gathered, would to aid the zoning committee on reaching a consensus on the zoning of offices.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nWith an estimated N12 trillion spent on fuel subsidy over the last 12 years, economic experts at the weekend lamented that the huge public sector inefficiency especially in the downstream petroleum and power indsutry is fast pushing the economy to the brink of collapse amid Federal Government\u2019s dwindling revenue in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.\n\nWhile many observers who spoke to Daily Sun argued that the retention of subsidy policies on fuel and electricity that benefit only the rich was no longer sustainable in the face of current global economic downturn, they posited that Nigeria\u2019s subsidy regimes have constantly crowded out resources needed for development financing in several key sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Nigerian economy which has been in dire need of investments in basic infrastructures, lost so much from government\u2019s infamous subsidy regime seen as the result of inefficiencies on the part of some agencies of government.\n\nFor instance, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, recently recalled that the Muhammadu Buhari administration had set aside N305 billion for fuel subsidy payments in the 2019 budget.\n\nThe administration ever announced it ended the subsidy regime in March of 2020 with the introduction of a price modulation policy.\n\nBut the subsidy cost suddenly resurfaced after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nSpeaking at the public consultative forum on the draft 2022-2024 medium-term expenditure framework/ fiscal strategy paper (MTEF/FSP) in July, Ahmed said subsidy gulps N150 billion every month. However, last week\u2019s announcement by the Federal Government it spends about N30billion monthly on electricity subsidy became the last straw that broke the Camel\u2019s back.\n\nBut according to the National President, Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN) Mr. Billy Gillis-Harry, subsidy especially for petrol and electricity is not good for economy as it only benefits the rich.\n\nHarris explained that subsidy in the electricity sector was baffling as he does not understand the methodology the government used in arriving at its conclusion that electricity is being subsidised.\n\n\u2018\u2018We do not want any resources of government to be frittered away in the name of subsidy. So let all forms of subsidy be removed and in its place, let us have what will impact the average Nigerian.\u201d He said\n\nHe further explained that the government should now sit down with its economic managers to work out how all the subsidies that have been removed can now be re-injected into the economy to stabilise it.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Kogi State at that time was notorious as the den of crimes and criminalities. Due to the state\u2019s strategic location, armed robbers and kidnappers attacked travellers frequently. However, on coming to office, you declared a full-blown war on armed robbers, criminals and kidnappers operating in the state.\n\n\u201cWhile other governors were going to the Presidential Villa begging for help to solve their security challenges, you took it upon yourself as the Chief Security Officer of the state to safeguard your people from men of the underworld. You provided the necessary equipment for security agencies.\u201d\n\nListing what Bello did to tackle insecurity, the MD said: \u201cIt is on record that you provided over 200 utility vehicles and over 500 motorcycles in one fell swoop for security patrol. You also employed the services of vigilance security outfit, while also providing sophisticated gadgets for Operation Total Freedom (OPT) you established to stamp out criminal activities in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the Kogi governor launched the Security Whistle Blower Policy, \u201cwherein reward was given to those who exposed criminals.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Vigilante Service Operation (VSO) and the domestication of the Criminal Justice Code, which you put in place, were also instrumental to the security of life and property in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said in order to arrest farmers/herdsmen clashes, Bello created a dialogue and cooperation platform for a free flow of communication between the government and herdsmen, on the one hand, and the communities and herdsmen on the other hand.\n\n\u201cThis move has ensured that both farmers and herdsmen are living peacefully together in the three senatorial districts of Kogi State.\u201d\n\nOn infrastructure and policy of the governor, Ukeh noted that despite the meagre resources Kogi has been turned into a construction site with several ongoing constructions, renovations and reconstructions\n\nHe maintained that the governor had provided succour to rural residents in some parts of Kogi East through the \u201clight up Kogi East Project\u201d while critical electricity distribution infrastructure was upgraded to enable and enhance power evacuation from Itobe substations in Ajaokuta.\n\nThe Sun Awards 2020 holds at the Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Saturday, October 16.\n\nApart from Gov.

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe Nigerian Government has introduced a two per cent annual increase on price based royalty for crude oil and condensates in the controversial Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe PIA, which tortuous journey into becoming a law started in 2007, targets the revamp of the oil and gas sector by ensuring optimal levels of transparency and accountability through strengthening of governance institutions and attracting the much-needed capital with changes to the administrative, fiscal and regulatory frameworks, was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, on August 26, 2021.\n\nAccording to the PIA, additional price based royalty shall apply to crude oil and condensates, which crystallises only when crude oil prices exceeds $50 ($100 shall attract 5 per cent and above $150 shall attract 10 per cent).\n\nThe rates apply to the 2020 fiscal year and shall be increased by 2 per cent yearly as provided in the PIA. The price-based royalty shall be credited to the Nigerian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe PIA had retained production-based royalty rates but added price-based royalty rates. Production-based royalty is between 5 per cent-15 per cent for crude oil and condensates and 5 per cent for gas although, for local gas supplies, the rate is lower at 2.5 per cent.\n\nNigeria is believed to have lost over $50 billion in the last ten years largely due to the uncertainties around the legal, administrative and fiscal policies of the oil and gas industry.\n\nOn fiscals, the PIA recognises the impact of the declining oil prices on operators\u2019 profitability and consequently adjusted some fiscal terms.\n\nThe Act replaced the Petroleum Profits Tax (PPT) with the Hydrocarbon Tax (HT), which applies to crude oil production, condensates and natural gas produced from associated gas in the onshore and shallow waters. It does not apply to associated and non-associated natural gas, and frontier acreage.\n\nHT is charged at varying rates depending on the licence.\n\nFor onshore and shallow waters, a rate of 30 per cent will be applied to converted Petroleum Mining Lease (PML), while a 15 per cent rate will be applied to converted PPLs.\n\nIn addition to the HT, companies involved in upstream operations will also be subjected to Companies Income Tax (CIT) at 30 per cent if such companies are involved in deep offshore, upstream gas, midstream or downstream activities.\n\nThis effectively caps the income tax rate applicable to oil and gas companies at 60 per cent, which is a reduction from the 85 per cent rate applicable under the Petroleum Profits Tax Act (PPTA). The fiscal terms in the PIA will apply upon the conversion of existing Oil Prospecting License(OPL) and Oil Mining License(OML) into Petroleum Production License(PPL) and PMLs, the termination or expiration of unconverted leases and the renewal of OMLs.\n\nWhile investors can model risk into their budgets and investments, modelling uncertainty (around the passage of the PIA) is difficult and explains the decreasing levels of investment in the sector as well as withdrawals of major International Oil Companies (IOCs) from Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nSadly, the performance of the global crude oil market directly influences the Nigerian government\u2019s finances as proceeds from the sale of crude oil account for over 90 per cent of the country\u2019s export revenue and 60 per cent of the government\u2019s total revenue.\n\nThe Nigerian Capital Importation Report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that capital importation targeted at the oil and gas sector averaged a meagre one per cent of the total capital imported into the country over the past three years (2018-2020), a significant reduction compared to 2016 (14 per cent), evidencing preferences for other sectors as investment destinations over the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe passage of the PIA has been hailed by industry players as a welcome development, albeit long overdue. The PIA is a root and branch review of the entire oil and gas sector and is expected to place Nigeria on the right path to competing better in the global oil and gas market.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Chinwendu Obienyi\n\nWith a weakened macroeconomic indices as well as worsening foreign exchange crisis, latest investigations have shown that foreign investors withdrew a total of N139.39 billion from the Nigeria\u2019s stock exchange between January and August 2021.\n\nAccording to the Domestic & Foreign Portfolio Investment report of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) for August 2021, foreign inflows dropped to N123.46 billion from N161.31 billion in 2020 year-to-date (ytd) while foreign outflows stood at N139.39 billion from N308.89 billion in 2020.\n\nThe report indicated that as at August 31, 2021, total transactions at the nation\u2019s bourse fell marginally by 0.39 per cent from N89.77 billion (about $218.20 million) in July 2021 to N89.42 billion (about $217.53 million) in August 2021.\n\nThe performance of the current month when compared to August 2020 (N94.45 billion) figures revealed that total transactions decreased by 5.33 per cent.\n\nAlso, in August 2021, the total value of transactions executed by domestic investors outperformed transactions executed by foreign investors by 44 per cent, as domestic inflows for the month under review stood at N33.82 billion while outflows stood at N30.24 billion. In the same vein foreign inflows and outflows stood at N10.72 billion and N14.64 billion respectively.\n\nFurther analysis of total transactions executed between the current and prior month (July 2021) revealed that domestic transactions fell by 13.71 per cent from N74.24 billion in July to N64.06 billion in August 2021.\n\nHowever, total foreign transactions increased by 63.30 per cent from N15.53 billion (about $37.75 million) to N25.36 billion (about $61.69 million) between July 2021 and August 2021.\n\nThe report also indicated that Institutional investors outperformed Retail investors by 0.44 per cent as the comparison of domestic transactions in the current and prior months (July 2021) revealed that retail transactions dropped by 15.16 per cent from N37.59 billion in July 2021 to N31.89 billion in August 2021. Similarly, the institutional composition of the domestic market decreased by 12.22 per cent from N36.65 billion in July 2021 to N32.17 billion in August 2021.\n\nDaily Sun investigations revealed that in 2018, N642.65 billion in foreign portfolio investment outflow was recorded, while foreign investors withdrew N523.42 billion and N481.93 billion during the corresponding period in 2019 and 2020.\n\nPiqued by the huge capital outflow from the equities market in 8 months, operators at the weekend predicted a gloomy outlook for the market and economy. They argued that the macroeconomic indices have been overwhelmingly weak, noting that the increase in foreign transactions was due to the knock-on impact of IMF\u2019s SDR allocation and the recently concluded Eurobond issuance on FPIs appetite for stocks.\n\nSpeaking during the Sunrise programme on Channels Television, Former Head, Banking and Finance Department at the Nasarawa State University Keffi, Professor Uche Uwaleke, said the GDP figure appears to be disconnected from reality as Nigeria\u2019s growth figures appear not to be quite an inclusive one.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cUnless the Federal Government improves the ease of doing business and addresses infrastructural deficits, the level of outflows might continue to increase\u201d.\n\nFor their part, analysts at Cordros Capital, said, \u201cOur expectation of yield moderation in the fixed income market bodes well for the equities market over the short to medium term. Similarly, we expect improved participation from FPIs on account of increased dollar liquidity at the I & E window given inflows from IMF\u2019s SDR allocation and the Eurobond issuance.\n\nAccordingly, we see scope for improved activities from both the domestic and foreign investors over the medium term\u201d.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Ahead of October Launch, eNaira Platform Goes Live",
          "text": "*Records one million hits in days after unveiling according to analytics\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe official website of the upcoming Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) digital currency, the eNaira, has gone live, exactly one week to the planned launch of the initiative.\n\nRemarkably, 24-hours after the website went live, it has recorded over one million hits, according to analytics monitored by THISDAY.\n\nThe development shows a reflection of the level of interest in the proposed digital currency.\n\nThe website promises easier financial transactions for users of eNaira, offers opportunity for peer-to-peer payments which allows users to send money to one another through a linked bank account or card; allows customers to move money from their bank account to their eNaira wallet with ease; can monitor their eNaira wallet, check balances and view transaction history; and make in-store payment using their eNaira wallet by scanning QR codes.\n\nIn addition, customers are allowed to scan the QR Code on the website to get started.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, while speaking to a gathering of foreign investors in New York, recently, had told his audience that because of activities surrounding the country\u2019s Independence celebration on October 1, the earlier planned launch of the eNaira on same date would likely be rescheduled to October 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe central bank would not want the event to take the shine away from the Independence celebration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency. It is a novel idea because we think it will facilitate trade, Nigeria being the biggest economy in Africa, this will set the tone to tell Africa that we are ready to lead and we would indeed lead in trade and we would make sure that happens.\n\n\u201cBetween all central bankers in ECOWAS, we are already working on certain collaboration to make trade, payment and banking system integrate in such a way to set example on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),\u201d he added.\n\nIn line with global trend, the CBN recently took a major step towards the launch of its digital currency with its formal announcement of its engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc. as its technical partner for the project. To choose the technical partner, the CBN went through a rigorous vendor selection process in line with the Public Procurement Act, conducted by seven departmental directors and a Deputy Governor whereby several companies were evaluated. The evaluation was based on the following criteria: technology ownership and control; implementation timeline; efficiency, ease of adoption; support for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT); platform security; interoperability; implementation experience.\n\nEmefiele expressed optimism that the eNaira, would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow. He said the digital money would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nAccording to him, after its unveiling, Nigerians should be able to download the eNaira app from either Google plays store or Apple app store, on board themselves and fund their eNaira wallet using their bank account or with cash at a registered agent location.\n\n\u201cIf you are a bank customer and you have say N10 million in your bank account, for your comfort of spending and making purchase, you can tell the bank to load N2 million out of your N10 million into your wallet.\n\n\u201cSo, your bank balance in physical cash drops to N8 million, while your e-wallet carries N2 million. With that you can make purchases both within and across the country.\n\n\u201cThere are so many variance of the eNaira. But this is where we would start because we are not going to pretend that there are not risks in opening your system up. We would look at the various products, determine the risk, determine the best way to mitigate the risk before we now open it up more and more,\u201d Emefiele added.\n\nAlso shedding more light on Bitts, he said, \u201cwe chose them as a partner. In some other climes where they are, they have their software and they earn their money. But we chose that they would establish their company in Nigeria. \u201cThe CBN will own substantially stake in that company. It is a company that will be established in Nigeria and majority holding will be the CBN,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the CBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained that the eNaira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017, to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s central bank last weekend announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cVirtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,\u201d the BBC quoted People\u2019s Bank of China to have said, warning it \u201cseriously endangers the safety of people\u2019s assets\u201d. China is one of the world\u2019s largest crypto-currency markets. Fluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (\u00a31,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement.\n\nIt was the latest in China\u2019s national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best \u2013 and a way to launder money at worst. Trading crypto-currency had officially been banned in China since 2019, but had continued online through foreign exchanges. However, there has been a significant crackdown this year.\n\nIn May, Chinese state intuitions warned buyers they would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry.\n\nIn June, it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactions and issued bans on \u201cmining\u201d the currencies \u2013 the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Joseph Hayab, said the 10 students were released on Sunday afternoon and were reunited with their parents.\n\nThis is as a former Senate Leader, Senator Ali Ndume, at the weekend, condemned in strongest terms, the recent killing of some Nigerian soldiers by Boko Haram insurgents in Marte-Dikwa Local Council Area of Borno State.\n\nHowever, while giving an update on the Bethel students kidnap debacle, Hayab expressed hope that the remaining 11 students would soon be released.\n\n\u201cTen more students of Baptist High School were released this afternoon. We have 11 now with bandits. Thanking all Nigerians for their prayers and support. Trusting God that the rest will be released very soon,\u201d Hayab said in a WhatsApp message to THISDAY.\n\nOn July 5, bandits invaded the school located about six kilometers away from Kaduna metropolis and abducted 121 students. The students have since been released in batches by the bandits.\n\nSo far, four batches of students, totaling 110 had been released, including those, who escaped from captivity.\n\nParents of the students were said to have paid a total of over N200 million as ransom to the bandits.\n\nThe bandits were said to have demanded and collected fresh ransom for each batch of students released.\n\nThree suspects arrested in connection with the abduction of the students were recently paraded by the Force Headquarters of the Nigerian police in Abuja.\n\nOn the the recent killing of some soldiers by insurgents in Marte-Dikwa, Borno, Ndume implored the military not to be deterred by the incident, which reportedly claimed the lives of no fewer than 15 soldiers.\n\nNdume, who is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, in a release on Sunday, called on the troops in war theatre area of Borno State not to allow their morale to be dampened.\n\nAccording to him, what happened is not enough to low the spirit of the soldiers but urged them to continue in the fight against insurgency and ending the menace in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe killing of the soldiers between Marte and Dikwa in Borno State is highly condemnable, it is sad and unfortunate. This should not discourage the troops and the Army from taking the war to the Insurgents. We send our condolences to the family of those killed and pray that God grant them eternal rest especially, as they died in the course of serving their father land.\u201d\n\nNdume added that as a nation, the people must continue to encourage and pray for the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouk Yahaya, along with the military hierarchy and officers and men for the good work they have been doing to end the Boko Haram insurgency attacks.\n\nThe ranking Senator also called on the federal government to adequately fund the military so that the officers and men could perform optimally.\n\nLast Friday, dozens of military troops on pass and on their way to Maiduguri, Borno State capital, were ambushed by suspected members of Boko Haram linked to ISWAP, killing several of them.\n\nThe incident reportedly took place between Marte-Dikwa council areas, when the insurgents fired rocket launchers at military trucks, which culminated into sporadic shootings targeting troops being conveyed from Marte to Maiduguri, after spending some time at the theatre.\n\nMarte, about 180km north of Maiduguri, remains one of the council areas of Borno not fully occupied by civilian population, as most of its people have been displaced and taking refuge in Monguno, and some parts of Maiduguri.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says but for agric intervention, Nigeria would still be net food importer\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, says the President Muhammadu Buhari government has committed more resources to diversification of the economy than any previous administration. Lawan spoke at the weekend during the inauguration of a Poultry Farm Centre established by the National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) at Gasamu, in Jakusko Local Government Area of Yobe State.\n\nThe senate president said no past government had invested as much resources in agriculture as Buhari\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have promised to diversify the economy of this country. For more than 50 years, our economy had been dependent on one single commodity and that is oil. Oil does not provide so much employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cThere could be revenues but, definitely, not the mainstream opportunities in terms of employment. But when you diversify into agriculture, you would have much more people engaged, especially, our youths, who today are largely unemployed or underemployed.\n\n\u201cSo we are diversifying the economy of Nigeria through agriculture and we have done so much as a country, as a government, in the last six years or so. No previous administration in Nigeria has committed as much funds, resources in agriculture as this administration.\u201d\n\nLawan added, \u201cI stand to be contradicted that if not because of resources that we have put in the agriculture sector, Nigeria would still have been importing the food that we eat. But everyone knows that the rice import bill have gone so low, almost to nothing today.\n\n\u201cWe used to spend billions of dollars every year to import rice, but we have been producing the rice that we eat.\u201d\n\nThe senate president, while thanking Buhari for approving the farm project, said it was in fulfilment of the promise made by the president on behalf of APC in 2015, to provide employment opportunities for the youths.\n\nAccording to Lawan, \u201cThis is one way of doing that and this is a very practical way of doing it. We have our youths who will be engaged. Presently, 30 youths will be engaged to manage the farm.\n\n\u201cThis is only the direct employment on this farm. When you look at the indirect opportunities, when you establish poultry farms across this zone, you would have brought in many youths to manage the poultry farms.\n\n\u201cGasamu, because of this project, is now going to be prominent in the Nigerian map. And this is something that is very important for us as a community here. If someone will come from Kano. If someone will come from Imo. If someone will come from Akwa Ibom to buy chicks here, to go and grow them and sell them to make money, why can\u2019t we in this community do the same?\n\n\u201cThis is one of the immediate benefits and I will urge our people not to lose the opportunity. I want to seize this opportunity also to appeal to NALDA that we want the capacity to go beyond 250,000 per annum. I want to assure you that our people will exhaust the 250,000 and they will need more.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, Executive Secretary of NALDA, Paul Ikonne, said the farm centre was established on the mandate of the president in order to empower the youth and get the country closer towards achieving food security.\n\nAccording to Ikonne, the farm has the capacity of generating 850 crates of egg daily and N1.1 million daily from the sale of birds only.\n\nHe said the birds had an incubator centre to produce day-old chicks that could be used to establish other poultry farms or sent to other poultry houses across the country.\n\nThe NALDA executive secretary said the revenue projection of the farm centre, with the capacity of 250,000 birds, was not less than N400 million annually.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Analysts Seek Revamp of Nigeria\u2019s Trade Policy to Unlock FX Inflows",
          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe federal government has been advised to take urgent steps to overhaul the country\u2019s trade policy in order to enhance foreign exchange (FX) inflow and achieve exchange rate stability.\n\nEconomists, who spoke with THISDAY, attributed the current scarcity of FX in the economy, partly, to delayed release of an updated trade policy for the country.\n\nMinister of Trade, Industry and Investments, Mr. Niyi Adebayo, had said his ministry was working towards producing an updated trade policy. But several attempts by THISDAY to confirm from the minister when the policy document would be ready were unsuccessful, as he did not to respond to enquiries.\n\nHowever, speaking in a chat with THISDAY, a former Director General, West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management, Professor Akpan Ekpo, stressed that trade policy was very crucial for any economy. Ekpo said trade policy helped in creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to manufacture and export non-oil products.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe country needs an updated trade policy as soon as possible. But one thing is having a trade policy, another thing is implementation. So, we need a trade policy that will take into account the present situation in the economy.\u201d\n\nSenior Lecturer at the Department of Economics, Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, Dr. Olalekan Aworinde, also emphasised the need for the federal government to have a practical trade policy in place.\n\nAworinde said, \u201cWhen you have a trade policy, the implication is that the direction as well as the volume of your trade will go to a particular country or a particular part of the world. This has a lot of implications on the FX market.\n\n\u201cLack of trade policy could be one of the reasons why we have been seeing the continuous devaluation of the naira. If you have a trade policy in place, you will be looking at a situation of export expansion because it is the expansion of exports that would bring in the FX earnings.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that you are likely going to see a situation where the naira is stable, if you have more goods from your country being exported to other countries, because you will be receiving dollars in exchange. This improves the dollar supply. But in Nigeria today, the reverse is the case. We now have a situation whereby we now have more imports than exports, which is one of the reasons we have the constant pressure on the naira exchange rate.\u201d\n\nFormer Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Kingsley Moghalu, in a recent interview on Arise News Channel, stressed the importance of export diversification. Moghalu pointed out that there was need for the country to have education, industrial and trade policies that are in alignment to support the growth of the economy.\n\nHe also said there was need to focus on productive knowledge in Nigeria, saying many people go through schools, but only a few have the kind of skills that can drive an industrially powered economy.\n\nMoghalu stated, \u201cWe find that the oil sector still continues to be the main source of revenue for the country, whereas export diversification should focus on value added manufactured goods that are competitively produced in the country, traded in the international market, and bringing us forex back into the country. That means you need to deal with trade policy. Why should goods that are imported from China be cheaper than goods manufactured in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cThat is a practical problem for industrial production in Nigeria. So, these are things we need to look at with trade policy, to export finished products. The way you benefit from devaluing the naira is that your foreign trade becomes more beneficial to you.\n\n\u201cBut we still continue to be an import-dependent economy and the gap between our export and import is so huge. So, trade policy is very important. We conduct monetary policy, fiscal policy, forex policy, without an alignment with trade, so there is broken connection.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi yesterday disclosed that all governors in the country have in principle agreed that open grazing was outdated and there was need to embrace modern livestock management approaches.\n\nHe said while speaking on \u2018THISDAYLIVE\u2019 a programme monitored on Arise News Channel.\n\nHis remark was in the light of the feud generated by the comments of Governors of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu and his Kaduna counterpart, Malam Nasir El- Rufai, following the anti-open grazing laws being adopted in most southern states.\n\nFayemi said the governors have also subscribed to the national livestock transformation plan via the National Economic Council decision that was taken during a meeting chaired by the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cAny time there is an altercation between any of my colleagues, it is something that I feel wholly uncomfortable about because it takes us away from the substance, in this case on open grazing.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we have taken a position as the NGF and both sides of the divide are correct. On the one hand, we have all agreed at the level of the NGF that open grazing is outdated and we need to look for alternative modern livestock management approaches,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nHe averred that there was need to balance the position of the southern governors on anti-open grazing legislation with that of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum by giving support to all states that have subscribed to the National Livestock Transformation Plan through funding from federal government agencies like NARSAL in same way the Central Bank of Nigeria provided support to rice farmers through funding.\n\n\u201cAnd that this could take the form of support to those who want to engage in ranching in the north and in the south. And that is why I said both sides are correct in the sense that Nasir El- Rufai of Kaduna State is talking about ranching as alternative way of stopping unrestrained open grazing and catering to the need of those who embark on open grazing approaches. And the southern governors are opposed to that.\n\n\u201cAll they are saying is pending the time you are able to do that, there should also be a disincentive by way of law in ensuring those who take advantage of the activities of herders, particularly non-violent herders and those who resort to violent crimes, need to be punished.\n\n\u201cBut in addressing criminality, we must also address causes of criminality, which I guess is what el-Rufai is talking about,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nCommenting on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), Fayemi said it would be wrong to assume that the proposed amendments ignored the concerns of the states.\n\nHe some of the observations which they sent to the President have been forwarded to the implementation committee chaired by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva while discussion is already on-going.\n\nFayemi noted that some of the issues they raised related to ownership structure. According to him, the governors were of the opinion that the Ministry of Finance incorporated and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources should be the sole owner of the company that emerged out of the PIA.\n\n\u201cWe have suggested that the only body that belongs to both the federal, state and the local governments is the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) in which we are shareholders.\n\n\u201cAnd if it is held in trust by the NSIA, then we are all more comfortable in seeing that Act as a federation company rather than a federal government company. And that is one.\n\n\u201cThe second concern we have expressed relates to the depletion of the federal government account by the various percentages that have been earmarked for frontier states and host communities of the petroleum products. \u201cAnd without prejudices to what the host communities deserve, we don\u2019t have any problem with the host communities benefiting from this, which as a matter of fact we feel should be five per cent.\n\n\u201cWe think that this necessarily should not lead to a depletion of the federation account or whatever is due to the fed account as a result of this,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the third concern which the governors had consistently raised and which they hope the signing of the PIA would help them address was petroleum subsidy and its continued use to deplete the Federation account.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Anthonia Uchenna, a former domestic worker at the house of former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has said the latter once beat up his mother-in-law.\n\nUchenna, who was a nanny at the former minister's house said he beat up his in-law after she queried him for beating and stripping his wife naked.\n\nShe said whenever he is furious, he beats up domestic workers, including her (Uchenna), strips them naked and sends them out of his house.\n\nAccording to her, the two years of service at Fani-Kayode's house was filled with torture, threats and maltreatment which explains why she resigned from her appointment as a nanny.\n\nShe said, \u201cMy name is Anthonia Uchenna, a former nanny at Femi Fani-Kayode's house. I started working with him in 2017 through 2019. I experienced many things at FFK's house, the way he handles his staff. Let me use myself as an example. Mine started the day the man paid salary in 2019 August, he paid me my salary and later sent someone to call me down to the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI came to the kitchen and then he asked me why the kitchen is in disarray, I told him he had not employed me as a kitchen worker or chef but as a nanny. I told him I had no job in the kitchen. He then asked me to return the money I signed as my salary, I gave it to him.\n\n\u201cHe seized it and I said this is not the first, second or third time, why does he do this every time? He said if I talk, he will throw me to the dog, they'll beat me up and everything so I got angry, went back upstairs to pack my bags that I don't want to work again but I want to leave.\n\n\u201cHe called bodyguards: Bako, Moses and others, that they shouldn't allow me to go outside the gate. When those ones said I shouldn't go outside the gate, I explained to them that I work and at the end of the month, after having signed salary, he will collect it back.\n\n\u201cWhile I was discussing with the bodyguards, he told those ones to hold me down and not allow me to leave, he (FFK) came downstairs, tore my clothes, stripped me naked and pushed me outside the gate, I was there for 24 hours naked.\n\n\u201cHe later sent a policeman to come and pick me. There's one guy, a gateman that gave me a 'polo' (T-shirt), I don't know if he's still working there.\n\n\u201cThe DPO (Divisional Police Officer) said they don't want to see FFK's staff anymore so the policeman took me back there to FFK's house, I was there for another 24 hours, asking them to give me my bag, he refused.\n\n\u201cEvery morning, Madam (his ex-wife) commanded that we should be taking his son to FFK's room every morning to greet his father. When you get there, Fani-Kayode will press your buttocks, breasts and I told him I don't want that. Even the small boy will say \u2018Daddy don't do that to my Aunty\u2019 then he will push me away and say I am disgusting and everything.

I started working with him in 2017 through 2019. I experienced many things at FFK's house, the way he handles his staff. Let me use myself as an example. Mine started the day the man paid salary in 2019 August, he paid me my salary and later sent someone to call me down to the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI came to the kitchen and then he asked me why the kitchen is in disarray, I told him he had not employed me as a kitchen worker or chef but as a nanny. I told him I had no job in the kitchen. He then asked me to return the money I signed as my salary, I gave it to him.\n\n\u201cHe seized it and I said this is not the first, second or third time, why does he do this every time? He said if I talk, he will throw me to the dog, they'll beat me up and everything so I got angry, went back upstairs to pack my bags that I don't want to work again but I want to leave.\n\n\u201cHe called bodyguards: Bako, Moses and others, that they shouldn't allow me to go outside the gate. When those ones said I shouldn't go outside the gate, I explained to them that I work and at the end of the month, after having signed salary, he will collect it back.\n\n\u201cWhile I was discussing with the bodyguards, he told those ones to hold me down and not allow me to leave, he (FFK) came downstairs, tore my clothes, stripped me naked and pushed me outside the gate, I was there for 24 hours naked.\n\n\u201cHe later sent a policeman to come and pick me.

And for the past three months, there have not been activities of the insurgents in our community.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoni, who was at the hospital when TheCable visited, said he lost his brother, Mustapha, a 31-year-old farmer, who was in search of what to have for breakfast when the airstrike took his life.\n\n\u201cMy elder brother died as a result of the incident, and my daughter, two years old, sustained injury and she is currently in the hospital receiving treatment,\u201d Goni narrated his predicament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYasarumat, their mother, said Hauwa, her granddaughter, was badly wounded in the airstrike, adding that the death of her son is very painful and unbearable.\n\n\u201cHe died in the morning when he was about to go get his breakfast,\u201d she said as she sits on the hospital bed next to Hauwa Goni Mustapha, the daughter of the deceased who was also injured in the attack.\n\nAlso speaking about the incident, Haruna Musa, a resident, said he lost two of his brothers, who were in a tricycle when the strike hit the village.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusa said he was at the farm when the incident happened but Mohammed and Ibrahim Audu, his brothers, were in transit in the town, when they were hit by the military airstrike.\n\nConfirming the number of the victims, Musa said \u201cnine people were killed and 24 people injured\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, Dauda Busari, the chairman of Yunusari LGA, and Musa Dambari, the lawmaker representing his constituency, came around and gave the injured victims and families of the deceased N10,000 each as compensation.\n\nMusa said the monetary compensation is not enough to bring back the dead or return their ruined properties, adding that the government needs to do more than that to compensate them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was at the farm when the blast happened. There are people that died in my family. In the town nine people died and in my family alone two people died. We are of the same mother and father. Their names are Mohammed and Ibrahim Audu,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey were in a tricycle when the incident happened. Politicians came to the hospital and gave N10,000 to the victims and families of the people that died.\n\n\u201cThe local government chairman, Dauda Busari and Ahmed Musa Dabouri are the politicians that came to share the money.\n\n\u201cThe N10,000 they gave us is not enough to treat those that were injured and can\u2019t return the lives of the dead. We want them to do more for us because we lost lives and properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy house was destroyed and my two camels and cows were killed in the incident.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time communities in the north-east will be accidentally hit by military airstrikes.\n\nNAF\u2019s misfiring of January 17, 2017 in Rann, Borno state, left 126 aid workers and refugees dead.\n\nNAF said it set up a board of inquiry to \u201cthoroughly\u201d investigate the circumstances of the incident in Yobe.\n\nIn his own reaction, Mai Mala Buni, governor of Yobe, directed government hospitals in Geidam and Damaturu to offer free medical services to those who sustained injuries in the disaster.",

          "title": "What will commerce look like in Africa over the next decade?",
          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nStranerd\u2019s plans for university students\n\nTwitter\u2019s Bitcoin plans\n\nSome news about Nigeria\u2019s 5G scene\n\nStranerd\u2019s plans for university students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStranerd\u2019s co-founders. Timmy Salami and Jeremiah Godwin\n\nOver the past few years, edtech solutions have sprung up in Nigeria to assist the work done by schools in the country.\n\nHowever, most of them focus on students in primary and secondary schools, with only a handful serving students in the university or those looking to get in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStranerd, an edtech startup founded by Jeremiah Godwin and Timmy Salami, is looking to plug that gap.\n\nWhat started as an Instagram page solving problems for students has since evolved into a platform connecting Nigerian students to tutors and their peers.\n\nSince launching, the startup has served over 40,000 students in 11 countries and plans to add more services in the future, including internships and study-abroad opportunities.\n\nCurious about Stranerd? Check out How edtech startup, Stranerd is connecting Nigerian students to tutors\n\nTwitter\u2019s new feature, Tip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, September 23, 2021, Twitter announced Tip, a feature that will allow users to tip their favourite creators directly from Twitter.\n\nFamiliar? Of course, it is. In May, the micro-blogging site announced testing a new feature called Tip Jar, which only differed from Tip in who had access \u2014 English Twitter users and a control group including journalists and experts.\n\nLike Tip Jar, the new feature works with third-party fintech apps like Cash App, Venmo, and Chipper and is currently available for iOS users, with the rollout for Android users coming this week. But that\u2019s not the interesting part.\n\nYou can also send a tip in Bitcoin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Simply add your Bitcoin wallet to your profile and start receiving tips in Bitcoin. Alternatively, users in El Salvador and the US can use Strike.\n\nWhat\u2019s Strike? It is a crypto wallet that runs on the Lightning Network, which speeds up Bitcoin transactions.\n\nMore gibberish? Well, here\u2019s a little explainer. The Lightning Network is a network that facilitates immediate Bitcoin transactions without going through miners. Essentially, it makes sending and receiving Bitcoin faster, just like fiat currencies.\n\nThe Strike wallet is currently used in El Salvador, the first country to use Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nAccording to Jack Mallers, Strike CEO, the integration on Twitter will lead to global usage.\n\nDuring the week, Our reporter, Bolu Abiodun, will explore the Lightning Network, the Twitter use case, and everything else in between.\n\nLook out for it.\n\nCatching up on the latest 5G news\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@macauphotoagency\u201d>Macau Photo Agency</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/5g?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nIn the last few weeks, Nigeria\u2019s 5G deployment seems to have gained some traction.\n\nMore recently, on Thursday, September 23, 2021, Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, revealed that the 5G network would be available by January 2022.\n\nHe disclosed this at a town hall meeting organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture to address vandalism of power and telecommunications infrastructure, where he was represented by Ubale Maska, Commissioner for Technical Services, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nThis comes two weeks after Nigeria\u2019s government approved the deployment of the 5G network.\n\nBefore that, in May 2021, the NCC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on the use of C-Band Spectrum for 5G services in Nigeria.\n\nAlso, in June 2021, the Commission inaugurated a committee on Spectrum auction for 5G deployment, which is expected to take place in the last quarter of the year.\n\nSo far, MTN is the only telco that has conducted successful 5G tests in Nigeria and is eagerly waiting to deploy the technology as soon as NCC conducts its auction.\n\nHowever, considering that the 3G and 4G networks only recently overtook 2G coverage in Africa, the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) is sceptical about the mass adoption of the 5G network anytime soon.\n\nAccording to the NCC, broadband penetration stood at 39.79% as of July 2021. And Maska told the House of Representatives in July that less than 50% of the country enjoys 3G coverage.\n\nThere\u2019s also the challenge of the affordability of 5G-enabled phones and the cost of setting up infrastructure for telcos.\n\nThis or that? Going by Pantami\u2019s words and if the NCC holds a spectrum auction, all things point to a January 2022 date for 5G deployment in Nigeria. Will it gain fast usage? That\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer for now.\n\nMeanwhile, you can check out 4 things we learnt from MTN Nigeria\u2019s 5G demo\n\nCatch up on these stories\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nGig work is precarious no matter the country.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Boss Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in the United States, Godwin talked with a girl. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work. But if there\u2019s any challenge, it would be understanding the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the Nigerian market is not easy, and Nigerians relate differently with edtech startups. I think that\u2019s where most edtech people have it wrong, trying to replicate what people in America are using.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Depending on the degree of severity, they use hearing aids, speech-to-text tools and sign languages to communicate.\n\nBefore yesterday, I thought there was just one universal sign language that every deaf person understood.\n\nHowever, studies show that there are over 300 sign languages in the world, and over 23 of them are used in Africa.\n\nInterestingly, technology is assisting people in Africa who have varying degrees of hearing loss.\n\nTo know how, please, read: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nOr watch the video: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nReelFruit raises $3 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s dried fruit snack brand, ReelFruit, has announced a $3 million Series A round to expand production, increase product offerings, and double down on exports to the US and other international markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlitheia IDF led the round with $2m. Samata Capital and Flying Doctor Healthcare Investment Company also participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Affiong Williams (CEO), ReelFruit is an agritech company that processes and distributes locally grown fruits. It claims to help communities by empowering fruit farmers by purchasing their raw materials.\n\nMore on its expansion plans, ReelFruit plans to build a new factory in Ogun State, Nigeria, to increase its monthly dried fruit production from 6 to 30 tonnes.\n\nIn its first year, the factory will employ over 200 people. With a larger supply of dried fruit, ReelFruit will develop new products for domestic and international markets.\n\nBy December 2021, the company plans to launch an eCommerce channel for direct US sales and open up more B2B opportunities, such as white-labelling and co-packing, to support the national drive toward import substitution.\n\nThe company believes local buyers will purchase dried fruit locally, reducing their reliance on imports.\n\nPaystack launches Apple Pay to help Nigerian businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack, an African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, announced yesterday that Pay with Apple Pay is now available on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean?

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s unending \u2018war\u2019",
          "text": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari boldly declared last Thursday while addressing world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Nigeria will spare no efforts at getting rid of the Boko Haram terrorists, a humbling indictment that the war against the terrorist group remained unfinished after over a decade of ravaging Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt was in December 2015, some seven months after he became president that Buhari announced that Nigeria had \u201ctechnically won the war\u201d against the Islamist Boko Haram militants.\n\nHe told the BBC that the terrorist group could no longer mount \u201cconventional attacks\u201d against security forces or population centres. It had been reduced to fighting with improvised explosives devices (IED) and remained a force only in its heartland of Borno State.\n\nBuhari continues to insist that the group has lost its teeth and is severely weakened. \u201cThe Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism; as a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u201d Buhari told the world leaders. Only a few days before, the insurgents had killed over 25 soldiers who were on patrol in Monguno area of Borno State.\n\nDescribed as one of the world\u2019s most lethal terror groups, Boko Haram and its affiliate groups have forced the closure of more than 600 schools in the northern part of Nigeria since 2010. In 2014, the group audaciously kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in the southern-Borno town of Chibok. Seven years later, more than 100 of the girls, with some 40 estimated to have died, have not been seen. Thousands of other students have been kidnapped since then.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s fighters target women and girls with rape and other sexual violence, amounting to war crimes during raids in northeast Nigeria.\n\nOsai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International Nigeria, noted, \u201cAs Boko Haram continue their relentless cycle of killings, abductions and looting, they are also subjecting women and girls to rape and other sexual violence during their attacks. These atrocities are war crimes.\n\n\u201cThe targeted communities have been abandoned by the (Nigerian) forces that are supposed to protect them, and are struggling to gain any recognition or response to the horrors they\u2019ve suffered. The Nigerian authorities must urgently address this issue\u201d.\n\nIn the beginning was Boko Haram\n\nBoko Haram was founded in the early 2000s by the late Mohammed Yusuf. The group whose name translates as \u201cwestern education is forbidden\u201d was like Islamist groups that have formed throughout Nigeria\u2019s history, committed to creating an anti-Western state, using violence if necessary.\n\nHowever, throughout Yusuf\u2019s tenure as the group\u2019s leader, Boko Haram sought to achieve its aims largely through peaceful means. From 2002 to 2009, the group supported Ali Modu Sheriff\u2019s bid for governor and was incorporated into his government when he won in 2003. Yusuf\u2019s father-in-law served as Sheriff\u2019s commissioner for religious affairs.\n\nThe group\u2019s founder and leader Mohammed Yusuf, was a fiery Wahhabi preacher who espoused Salafist beliefs.\n\nWahhabi is a label given to those who follow the teachings of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, an 18th Century Saudi preacher. Wahabism is a form of Sunni Islam and it is the only officially accepted religion of Saudi Arabia, which brutally suppresses other religious tendencies whether Islamic or non-Islamic. This brand of Islam is particularly intolerant of Shia and Sufi faiths which it considers heretical. The Wahhabis are always referred to as Salafis, and in fact they prefer to be called as such. As a rule, all Wahhabis are Salafis but not all Salafis are Wahhabis.\n\nThe term Salafism did not become associated with the Wahhabi creed until the 1970s. It was in the early 20th Century that the Wahhabis referred to themselves as Salafis. A Salafist is an individual who emphasises the importance of returning to a \u201cpure\u201d Islam, that of the Salaf, the pious ancestors. Salafists advocate literal and to some degree binary interpretation of Islamic teachings as enjoined by Prophet Muhammad and subsequently practised by the early pious predecessors known as the salaf al-salih. Following the salaf is the reason for their self-designation as Salafis.\n\nIn July 2009, the group launched a revolt through coordinated attacks in four locations in northern Nigeria; Bauchi in Bauchi State, Maiduguri in Borno State, Potiskum in Yobe State and Wudil in Kano State. The aim was to trigger the violent creation of an Islamic state. The revolt was ruthlessly suppressed by the army.\n\nYusuf was captured in his parents-in-law\u2019s house in Maiduguri by a unit of the Army\u2019s 21st Armoured Brigade. They handed him to the Nigeria Police. The Nigeria police, allegedly notorious for heavy handedness and extra-judicial killings, summarily executed Yusuf in public view outside the police headquarters in the city. Police officials variously claimed that he was shot while trying to escape, or that he died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government acknowledged the extra-judicial murder of the Boko Haram founder and promised to investigate the incident. Unsurprisingly, nothing has ever come out of that promise.\n\nBitter at the brutal suppression of their uprising and the unwarranted murder of their leader, Boko Haram began a decade of brutal war against the Nigerian state and innocent people in the region. Today, it has become a war without end.\n\nThe group acquired new leadership under Abubakar Shekau, a Kanuri who had been Yusuf\u2019s deputy. Shekau, according to former US Ambassador to Nigeria and Africa analyst at the Centre for Foreign Relations, John Campbell, \u201cwas a monster, known for his brutal executions that he publicized, his use of women and children as suicide bombers, and his wholesale kidnapping: he orchestrated the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls, more than a hundred of whom remain in captivity. He mastered the politics of terror. He was charismatic and erratic with some education: he deliberately misquoted Abraham Lincoln. He was also a religious leader and drew on the well of Islamic grievance in northern Nigeria to produce a belief system largely regarded as a perversion of Salafist-inflected Islam but one which has spread in the Sahel\u201d.\n\nUnder Shekau, the group swiftly enlarged the deadliness and regularity of its attacks on government and civilian targets in Nigeria, while recruiting from relegated, oppressed, and poor populations across the region. Boko Haram withstood the Nigerian military\u2019s poorly planned, poorly resourced, and half-hearted attempts to beat it back.\n\nA season of sorrow, tears and pain\n\nBoko Haram has since 2009 killed thousands of soldiers and civilians. The UNDP says that nearly 350,000 people have been killed in the North-East since the insurgency against the Nigerian state began.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), some 3,000,000 people have been displaced in the Lake Chad region and about 310,000 Nigerians have become refugees. More than 1,100 people were killed in the first half of 2020, according to Amnesty International, with more than 300 deaths in April alone.\n\nThe group killed at least 967 people in 2017, marginally more than the 910 deaths that were reported in 2016. It has consistently mounted attacks over the years, challenging Mr. Buhari\u2019s claim that the militants had been beaten. It caused 750 security force casualties in 2019 alone, close to double that of any prior year.\n\nIn January 2020, the terrorist group kidnapped Reverend Lawan Andimi, chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria in Adamawa State, rejected a ransom and executed him that month. That same month, they attacked Michika and later Garkida in Adamawa, killing scores of innocent civilians In February, several buses and trucks carrying passengers were set on fire in Auno, Borno State. The attack killed at least 30.\n\nThe trucks were stranded at a military checkpoint due to a curfew set by the military. In March, the extremists ambushed Goneri village in Yobe State. The attack killed over 50 soldiers. In November 2018, more than one hundred Nigerian soldiers were reported killed in one single attack on an army base in Metele, Borno State. \u201cThe insurgents took us unawares,\u201d said an officer who spoke to Reuters. \u201cThe base was burned with arms and we lost about 100 soldiers. It is a huge loss.\u201d\n\nThat same year, 76 farm workers were slaughtered in rice fields near the village of Zabarmari. Boko Haram said the attack was waged to seek revenge on villagers for seizing the group\u2019s fighters and handing them over to the authorities.\n\nA floundering government\n\nFor a government big on optics and low on solutions, and keen to deodorise the noxious socio-political environment that has pitted the people against an administration that has failed to win the war it claims to have largely or technically won, the President and his officials have consistently doubled down on the lie that Boko Haram has been essentially defeated.\n\nLieutenant General Tukur Buratai, the immediate past and longest serving army Chief, on February 24, 2016, giddily yet falsely announced to members of the once vociferous but now largely noiseless Borno Elders Forum, \u201cwe were given three major tasks and we have made efforts toward achieving two. The first task is to defeat Boko Haram and I want to tell you that as of today Boko Haram has been defeated. When I say defeat, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there won\u2019t be hitches here and there. We have entered the mop-up stage of our operation\u201d.\n\nInformation minister, Lai Mohammed, in 2019 said, \u201cI stand by what I said that Boko Haram is technically defeated. What we are having today is global terrorism where you have the ISIS, ISWAP Al-Qaeda all working together\u201d.\n\nYet, just a year later, he complained that, \u201cterrorists use media and publicity as oxygen and so when they go on this kind of mindless killings, a dying terrorist group will suddenly spring to life. However, we must also understand that we are dealing with terrorists who are financed globally and we also need more support from global partners.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Nigeria had made attempts to acquire better and more effective platforms to deal with the terrorists, but for one reason or the other we have been denied these platforms,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February 2020, almost five years after claiming to have largely defeated Boko Haram, Mr. Buhari railed against the people of Borno State after being booed by the residents of the capital city, Maiduguri. He blamed the leaders of Borno communities for not doing enough in terms of cooperation with the military to end the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\n\u201cThis Boko Haram or whoever they are, cannot come up to Maiduguri or its environs to attack without the local leadership knowing\u2026 As the commander in chief, I will deal with the security situation\u201d, he said.\n\nOn March 23, 2020, Boko Haram launched a seven-hour assault on a Chadian army base at Bohoma that killed 93 Chadian soldiers, the deadliest-ever attack by Boko Haram on the country\u2019s military forces. In response Chadian President, Idriss Deby, adorned his army fatigues, rallied his forces from all fronts, and ramped up targeted and sweeping air, ground and amphibious operations against the terrorists. Tagged \u2018Operation Boma Anger\u2019, this military campaign was so effective that Boko Haram\u2019s hunted leader, Abubakar Shekau had to release a viral message to his fleeing fighters pleading with them not to run away from the battle but to \u201ctake heart\u201d as God was bigger than the army of Chad.\n\nObviously embarrassed by the tenacity and outcomes of the widely applauded Chadian offensive, Nigeria\u2019s Army Chief of Staff, Tukur Buratai announced that he was relocating to the North-East \u201cwhere he is overseeing and directing the overall operation in the theatre and other Nigerian Army operations across the country\u201d.\n\nTo many analysts, it was abundantly clear that it was the height of the usual government optics, nothing tangible ever came out of that hurriedly assembled relocation ordered by the President.\n\nIn December of that year, having been unable to deliver on his vow to defeat Boko Haram, Mr. Buratai shockingly predicted that Nigeria will most likely continue to suffer terrorist attacks for the next 20 years.\n\n\u201cThis crisis might not end in 20 years, \u201che had said. \u201cWe have achieved a lot of successes but we cannot continue to use the same tactics and achieve different results. It only depends on the level of escalation and the appropriate responses by all stakeholders both civil and military authorities. Also, by both local and international actors. Citizens\u2019 responsibility is equally important and imperative. All must cooperate to contain the lingering insecurity. Let there be collective action and responsibility,\u201d he had said.\n\nPerhaps basking in the euphoria of battlefield successes of 2015 and 2016, the former Nigerian Army Commander had been too quick to declare victory. Watchers of the Nigerian military do remember that in the midst of Nigeria\u2019s election season, and determined to ensure victory at the polls, then President Goodluck Jonathan in early 2015 ordered a renewed military offensive against Boko Haram. Led by then GOC of the 7 Division, Major-General Lamidi Adeosun, the Army began making headway against the group. The Nigerian Military, supported by private military contractors led by Eeben Barlow\u2019s \u2018Specialised Tasks, Training, Equipment and Protection International\u2019, STTEP, seized back most of the territory previously held by Boko Haram.\n\nIn February of that year, Monguno, the local government of Mr. Buhari\u2019s National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno as well as Marte local government were recaptured from Boko Haram. By the time Buhari assumed office in May 2015, practically all the territory under Boko Haram\u2019s control had been taken over by the Nigerian Military and that was why elections took place in all the local governments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in 2015, and Buhari and his party won an overwhelming majority of votes in those states. The Tukur Buratai led Army from August 2015 merely consolidated on the initial victories chalked up by the pre-Buhari administration.\n\nBy mid-2017, the Nigerian Army had begun to lose the initiative and hand back territories to Boko Haram. In February this year, Boko Haram again hoisted its flag in Marte. In June 2020, at least 20 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were said to have been killed in twin attacks on Monguno and Nganzai, that came days after some 81 villagers were killed in Gubio. The loss of territories began with the removal of the Theatre Commander, Major-General Leo Irabor, now Chief of Defence Staff in May 2017 alongside the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, then Brigadier-General Emeka Ezeogwu and their replacement with Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru and Brigadier-General Ibrahim Yusuf, respectively.\n\nImmediate past governor of Borno state Kashim Shettima would later in 2018 decry this inopportune change when as governor he opined that the Boko Haram insurgency regained momentum in 2017 because of the failure of command at the theatre of war. He lamented, \u201cthe change of guard at the Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre Command which saw the replacement of Lucky Irabor, a Major General who is now at the Multinational Joint Task Force, did not help in sustaining the winning spirit of troops,\u201d adding that Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru \u201cdid not give a good account of himself as his tenure as Theatre Commander was greeted by embarrassing attacks on troops and civilians.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian state as the problem\n\nThe contest for political, economic and social power in Nigeria is largely driven by religion in Northern Nigeria, while ethnicity is the basis for power contestation in the South. That is why most violence in the North tends to have religious colourations even if it is really nothing more than a competition over a piece of land.\n\nNigeria has since the 1980s been characterised by varying forms of ethno-religious violence.\n\nBeginning with the Maitasine insurgency between 1979 and 1983 in which between 4000-6000 lost their lives, and trailed by a plethora of successive ethnic, religious and social upheavals in the 1980s and 1990s, the Nigerian state has unenthusiastically dealt with these nihilist insurgencies in a manner that laid the basis for the insurrection against the state by Boko Haram.\n\nSome of the prominent examples include those of the Kasuwan Magani in 1980, Zango Kataf and Gure-Kahugu in 1987, Kafanchan and Lere in 1987, Ilorin and Jerein 1989, Tafawa Balewa in 1991 as well as that of Zango Kataf in 1992, Kaduna in 2000, Jos in 2001. No part of Northern Nigeria has been immune of violence of one religious nature or the other\n\nPerpetrators of religious violence have rarely been brought to justice. There has been a long culture of appeasement of religion by successive Nigerian governments, which has culminated in the emboldening of religious zealots assured of almost a free pass by the Nigerian state. It is common in Nigeria to keep hearing of sponsors of Boko Haram and other violent actors, sometimes coming out of government circles, yet, no one is ever charged or outed. A former security officer agreed that \u201cwhen religious and communal conflicts occur, we tend to look purely at the political dimension without seeking to prosecute and punish criminal actors. Perhaps, if this is consistently done, it would make those who engineer these criminal activities to think twice\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Boko Haram militants: Six reasons they have not been defeated, by BBC\n\nThe inability of the Nigerian state to forcefully challenge political religion has led to new theatres of war in the north. This leads to the conclusion that the boldness of these new actors is linked to the government\u2019s inability to deal decisively with the crisis in the north-east.\n\nThus, the battle against Boko Haram can be justifiably termed the battle Nigeria was supposed to fight years and years ago but refused to.\n\nInternational dimension of Boko Haram\n\nIt has been suggested within intelligence circles both in Nigeria and outside, that the unending Boko Haram insurgency has its fibrous roots outside the country. There is ample evidence as consistently stated by the leadership of the United States Africa Command and supported by intelligence reports by Nigeria\u2019s different intelligence services, that Boko Haram has over time received training, funding and logistic support from Islamist elements in Mauritania, Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) as well as from the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab responsible for the recent deadly terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nIn March 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Abubakar Shekau, the group\u2019s then leader, said, \u201cWe announce our allegiance to the caliph\u2026 and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity. We call on Muslims everywhere to pledge allegiance to the caliph.\u201d\n\nThus, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) was formed. With its most significant provinces in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nAfrica analyst, Jacob Zenn, noted that, as ISIS faced defeat and began losing its \u201cterritorial caliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria, the terror group\u2019s leadership knew that the organisation would have to depend on external \u201cprovinces\u201d (called wilayat) to keep its global project thriving. The provinces would launch attacks and remain loyal to ISIS, and ISIS could claim that the \u201ccaliphate\u201d might no longer be expanding, but it was remaining. With setbacks in Afghanistan and the Philippines, Africa emerged as the only continent where ISIS could operate like it did in Syria and Iraq during its heyday. So long as ISIS thrives in Africa, the dream of the global caliphate remains alive.\n\nNot only can ISIS conduct sophisticated attacks in Africa, it also can occupy territories and overpower armies. Moreover, with rapidly increasing populations, historical narratives about reviving pre-colonial Islamic states, and challenges resulting from weak governance and security forces\u2019 abuses, ISIS finds fertile ground on the continent.\n\nBy June 2019, ISWAP was becoming ISIS\u2019s strongest external province. ISIS\u2019s influence had become so strong in the Sahel and Lake Chad region that it could order the capture and execution of Boko Haram\u2019s leader and one time ISIS ally, Abubakar Shekau.\n\nShekau, one of the most notorious leaders of Islamic militant groups anywhere in the world, died in May after detonating an explosive device while being pursued by fighters from ISWAP. The ISWAP fighters had stormed the Sambisa Forest, a swath of strategically important dense forest in Nigeria\u2019s north-east, which was Shekau\u2019s base.\n\nBulama Bukarti, an analyst specialising in Boko Haram at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Reuters after Shekau\u2019s death that Islamic State \u201cis consolidating the whole area, the Lake Chad region and Shekau\u2019s stronghold\u201d.\n\nCorruption benefits Boko Haram\n\nNigeria\u2019s military budgetary allocation is higher than the budgets of all other West African countries\u2019 defence or military operations put together. In 2020, military expenditure for Nigeria was $2,568 billion. Between 2015 and 2020, $11, 881 billion was spent on the military with little accruing to the country by way of peace.\n\nOn the contrary, the frontiers of violence in the country have expanded widely since 2015, as the military have been hampered by an equally dangerous enemy \u2013 corruption.\n\nTransparency International (TI) in a 2014 report noted that Nigerian military officers, politicians and other elites have enriched themselves by diverting money that was meant to fight terror. Since defence makes up 20 percent of Nigeria\u2019s budget, it is an attractive target.\n\nSeven years later, nothing has changed. Two retired army generals agreed that a lot of the budgetary allocations to the armed forces disappeared through bribes, payments to \u201cghost soldiers\u201d who don\u2019t exist, and through contracts not tendered and contested for, resulting in inflated spending that benefits politically-connected contractors.\n\n\u201cIf you want to solve the Boko Haram issue, follow the money\u201d, one said. He added that corruption is the biggest driver of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe lack of an updated, published defence policy weakens the accountability of the whole defence sector and makes scrutiny over defence matters, including budget and acquisition planning, harder.\n\nTransparency International in its 2020 Government Defence and Security report noted that while, \u201cthe annual defence budget is publicly available but the percentage of secret spending related to national security and intelligence services is difficult to establish, and off-budget expenditures are permitted by law, which often allows for non-orthodox practices, such as the \u2018security vote\u2019 to take place\u201d.\n\nIt further noted, \u201cSoldiers\u2019 payments are often irregular and hardly adequate in Nigeria, which has an impact on the motivation of its troops; this increases the likelihood of the phenomenon of the ghost soldiers, which is significant in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nOn corruption as an operational risk to the Nigerian military, the report gathered that, \u201cWhile corruption is recognised as an issue to be addressed within military circles, corruption is not systematically identified at the operational planning stage and is not seen as requiring contingency planning. There is no evidence of systematic corruption risk monitoring during operations.\n\n\u201cThere is provision made for training on issues relating to corruption, but it tends to be ad hoc and the connection between corruption, operational efficiency, and effectiveness could be emphasised further. The engagement of private military contractors in operations is unregulated, nor subject to scrutiny, and its costs are off-budget, meaning that private military contractors have access to significant power in an unregulated manner\u201d.\n\nIt further added that the procurement in the military is fraught with irregularities. Scrutiny, it said over matters of defence procurement \u201cis very limited in Nigeria. The Public Procurement Act excludes sensitive acquisitions relating to defence or security from its purview unless otherwise stated by the President, often resulting in significant expenditure going unscrutinised. Additionally, the lack of an updated defence policy contributes to the hardship in effectively scrutinising the sector\u2019s financial activities; for example, it makes the needs assessment phase of the budget cycle difficult to scrutinise and purchases are often ad hoc, rather than part of a long-term strategic acquisition plan. Information on the defence procurement cycle is not disclosed to the public and the National Assembly and external bodies play a marginal role in overseeing the process. Other unorthodox practices are also widespread, including security votes and single sourcing\u201d.\n\nEnding the war \u2013 What kind of reforms are needed?\n\nThe reality of terrorism and other anti-state violence is the exploitation of the inherent weaknesses in the operational capacity of the military in order to demean the authority of the state and vitiate the legitimacy of the government of the day. A weak security infrastructure certainly means a weak government. What is not in doubt, is that the Nigerian security services; including the military, police and special services, are not fit for purpose, as alleged by many Nigerians. They are operationally deficient, institutionally weak and structurally decayed.\n\nAs aptly noted in a June 2016 Crisis group report, \u201cthe decline began during 33 years of military dictatorship that took a serious toll on professionalism, operational effectiveness and accountability\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian military, which used to be among the continent\u2019s strongest and a backbone of regional and global peacekeeping efforts, has become a blemished force; suffering from an acute readiness crisis. It is overstretched, under-manned, grossly under-equipped, ill-trained, and poorly led. Even more unpleasant is the fact that the three services are locked in intense unhealthy competition, with neither the administrative head of the military (Minister of Defence) nor the operational head (Chief of Defence Staff) able to arbitrate.\n\nThis has resulted in lone wolf approaches to operations; with individual services working in silos rather than in concert, thus imperilling the counterterror/counterinsurgencies campaigns across the country. In addition, this obvious lack of operational and administrative oversight has resulted in the services pursuing prestige projects with no real value to operational capacity, frittering away already hard to get and inadequate resources.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2019, Nigeria\u2019s expenditure on military remained stable at around 0.5 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. In 2019, the military spending amounted to 0.46 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\nAfter decades of underfunding the military, Nigeria\u2019s defence budget has increased substantially during the past 10 years. Yet the performance of the country\u2019s military remains poor. And the country\u2019s security challenges continue as can be seen from the latest data from the 2019 Global Terrorism Index report which ranked Nigeria as the third-worst nation prone to terrorism with no improvement since 2017.\n\nWith this heavy expenditure, why are the outcomes so poor?\n\nAnti-corruption/transparency\n\nIt is more than obvious that the inability to get positive outcomes is due to the never-ending corruption prevalent in the military hierarchy in which budgetary allocations meant for military-centric activities are deployed to procure office goods, services, building structures, and overseas trips. In addition, there is also clear and irrefutable evidence that corrupt and incompetent security chiefs have turned the nation\u2019s security into a \u201cbusiness venture\u201d, thus jeopardising the capacity of the military to access effective and efficient resources and assets to defend the nation\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nTraining and doctrine\n\nThe challenge facing the Nigerian military, as clearly evident over the last decade, is to train a force that is capable of winning wars. The operational environment and the changing Character of warfare necessitate a change in the way officers and men are recruited, trained, deployed and promoted.\n\nIn the conflict against Boko Haram, we have seen whole battalions running away from the battlefield, and cases of soldiers losing their will to fight. While access to efficient equipment has been cited as the main reason for this, it is obvious that it is a secondary reason.\n\nThere is ample evidence that soldiers from Niger, Chad and Cameroon are no better resourced than their Nigerian counterparts, yet they have proved to be more zealous on the battlefield and keener to take risks.\n\nOne of the critical factors responsible for this lethargic approach by the Nigerian military is the methodology for recruiting officers and soldiers, the manner of training and on-boarding, as well as the methodology for deploying and promoting them.\n\nThe Nigerian military has over the years become a \u2018tribal employment portal\u2019 where emphasis is placed on language, tribe and religion at the expense of capability, efficiency and merit.\n\nThe resultant outcome is a large corps of officers and men incapable of securing the country and unwilling to put their \u2018best foot\u2019 forward in the arena of battle. The reason is not hard to fathom; many joined the military not out of patriotism and a willingness to serve, but out of material need for a source of regular income.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need to redefine who can become a soldier and how that process takes place. The distorted system of recruitment, postings, transfers, promotions, rewards and punishment needs a complete overhaul to engender patriotism and selflessness and thus, get the best of the best into the military.\n\nFurthermore, the deployment of soldiers for internal security operations such as anti-kidnapping, anti-crime and anti-cultism operations completely negates the training and doctrine as well as the responsibilities of the military.\n\nThe end result has been the erosion of the professionalism of soldiers as well as the vitiation of their distinctive soldierly quality as they get more and more involved in civilian matters.\n\nTo reverse this trend, it is more than important that the Police is encouraged and well-resourced to take on their assigned responsibilities of fighting crime and criminality in order to relieve the military of such extraneous duties that add no value to the capability of the military.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pressing imperative to interrogate the method of appointing the leadership of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Pertinent questions to ask in this regard include: Must ethnicity and religion be the yardstick for determining who heads the varied services or should clear evidence of academic, operations, leadership and management capability be the sensible criteria?\n\nShould course mates and seniors of newly appointed chiefs who aren\u2019t due for retirement be forced to resign, thus depleting the services of well-trained officers and managers. Isn\u2019t it reasonable and more compelling for the country and the military that those who are willing to continue serving be allowed to do so? Shouldn\u2019t service chiefs be constitutionally allowed to serve two terms of two years each in order to insulate them from political influence of the executive leadership? Isn\u2019t there a need to place an embargo on the promotion of senior officers in the military until such a time when the major conflict in the north-east has been decisively won?",

          "text": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari boldly declared last Thursday while addressing world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Nigeria will spare no efforts at getting rid of the Boko Haram terrorists, a humbling indictment that the war against the terrorist group remained unfinished after over a decade of ravaging Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt was in December 2015, some seven months after he became president that Buhari announced that Nigeria had \u201ctechnically won the war\u201d against the Islamist Boko Haram militants.\n\nHe told the BBC that the terrorist group could no longer mount \u201cconventional attacks\u201d against security forces or population centres. It had been reduced to fighting with improvised explosives devices (IED) and remained a force only in its heartland of Borno State.\n\nBuhari continues to insist that the group has lost its teeth and is severely weakened. \u201cThe Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism; as a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u201d Buhari told the world leaders. Only a few days before, the insurgents had killed over 25 soldiers who were on patrol in Monguno area of Borno State.\n\nDescribed as one of the world\u2019s most lethal terror groups, Boko Haram and its affiliate groups have forced the closure of more than 600 schools in the northern part of Nigeria since 2010. In 2014, the group audaciously kidnapped 276 girls from their school dormitory in the southern-Borno town of Chibok. Seven years later, more than 100 of the girls, with some 40 estimated to have died, have not been seen. Thousands of other students have been kidnapped since then.\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s fighters target women and girls with rape and other sexual violence, amounting to war crimes during raids in northeast Nigeria.\n\nOsai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International Nigeria, noted, \u201cAs Boko Haram continue their relentless cycle of killings, abductions and looting, they are also subjecting women and girls to rape and other sexual violence during their attacks. These atrocities are war crimes.\n\n\u201cThe targeted communities have been abandoned by the (Nigerian) forces that are supposed to protect them, and are struggling to gain any recognition or response to the horrors they\u2019ve suffered. The Nigerian authorities must urgently address this issue\u201d.\n\nIn the beginning was Boko Haram\n\nBoko Haram was founded in the early 2000s by the late Mohammed Yusuf. The group whose name translates as \u201cwestern education is forbidden\u201d was like Islamist groups that have formed throughout Nigeria\u2019s history, committed to creating an anti-Western state, using violence if necessary.\n\nHowever, throughout Yusuf\u2019s tenure as the group\u2019s leader, Boko Haram sought to achieve its aims largely through peaceful means. From 2002 to 2009, the group supported Ali Modu Sheriff\u2019s bid for governor and was incorporated into his government when he won in 2003. Yusuf\u2019s father-in-law served as Sheriff\u2019s commissioner for religious affairs.\n\nThe group\u2019s founder and leader Mohammed Yusuf, was a fiery Wahhabi preacher who espoused Salafist beliefs.\n\nWahhabi is a label given to those who follow the teachings of Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, an 18th Century Saudi preacher. Wahabism is a form of Sunni Islam and it is the only officially accepted religion of Saudi Arabia, which brutally suppresses other religious tendencies whether Islamic or non-Islamic. This brand of Islam is particularly intolerant of Shia and Sufi faiths which it considers heretical. The Wahhabis are always referred to as Salafis, and in fact they prefer to be called as such. As a rule, all Wahhabis are Salafis but not all Salafis are Wahhabis.\n\nThe term Salafism did not become associated with the Wahhabi creed until the 1970s. It was in the early 20th Century that the Wahhabis referred to themselves as Salafis. A Salafist is an individual who emphasises the importance of returning to a \u201cpure\u201d Islam, that of the Salaf, the pious ancestors. Salafists advocate literal and to some degree binary interpretation of Islamic teachings as enjoined by Prophet Muhammad and subsequently practised by the early pious predecessors known as the salaf al-salih. Following the salaf is the reason for their self-designation as Salafis.\n\nIn July 2009, the group launched a revolt through coordinated attacks in four locations in northern Nigeria; Bauchi in Bauchi State, Maiduguri in Borno State, Potiskum in Yobe State and Wudil in Kano State. The aim was to trigger the violent creation of an Islamic state. The revolt was ruthlessly suppressed by the army.\n\nYusuf was captured in his parents-in-law\u2019s house in Maiduguri by a unit of the Army\u2019s 21st Armoured Brigade. They handed him to the Nigeria Police. The Nigeria police, allegedly notorious for heavy handedness and extra-judicial killings, summarily executed Yusuf in public view outside the police headquarters in the city. Police officials variously claimed that he was shot while trying to escape, or that he died of wounds he sustained during a gun battle with the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government acknowledged the extra-judicial murder of the Boko Haram founder and promised to investigate the incident. Unsurprisingly, nothing has ever come out of that promise.\n\nBitter at the brutal suppression of their uprising and the unwarranted murder of their leader, Boko Haram began a decade of brutal war against the Nigerian state and innocent people in the region. Today, it has become a war without end.\n\nThe group acquired new leadership under Abubakar Shekau, a Kanuri who had been Yusuf\u2019s deputy. Shekau, according to former US Ambassador to Nigeria and Africa analyst at the Centre for Foreign Relations, John Campbell, \u201cwas a monster, known for his brutal executions that he publicized, his use of women and children as suicide bombers, and his wholesale kidnapping: he orchestrated the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls, more than a hundred of whom remain in captivity. He mastered the politics of terror. He was charismatic and erratic with some education: he deliberately misquoted Abraham Lincoln. He was also a religious leader and drew on the well of Islamic grievance in northern Nigeria to produce a belief system largely regarded as a perversion of Salafist-inflected Islam but one which has spread in the Sahel\u201d.\n\nUnder Shekau, the group swiftly enlarged the deadliness and regularity of its attacks on government and civilian targets in Nigeria, while recruiting from relegated, oppressed, and poor populations across the region. Boko Haram withstood the Nigerian military\u2019s poorly planned, poorly resourced, and half-hearted attempts to beat it back.\n\nA season of sorrow, tears and pain\n\nBoko Haram has since 2009 killed thousands of soldiers and civilians. The UNDP says that nearly 350,000 people have been killed in the North-East since the insurgency against the Nigerian state began.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), some 3,000,000 people have been displaced in the Lake Chad region and about 310,000 Nigerians have become refugees. More than 1,100 people were killed in the first half of 2020, according to Amnesty International, with more than 300 deaths in April alone.\n\nThe group killed at least 967 people in 2017, marginally more than the 910 deaths that were reported in 2016. It has consistently mounted attacks over the years, challenging Mr. Buhari\u2019s claim that the militants had been beaten. It caused 750 security force casualties in 2019 alone, close to double that of any prior year.\n\nIn January 2020, the terrorist group kidnapped Reverend Lawan Andimi, chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria in Adamawa State, rejected a ransom and executed him that month. That same month, they attacked Michika and later Garkida in Adamawa, killing scores of innocent civilians In February, several buses and trucks carrying passengers were set on fire in Auno, Borno State. The attack killed at least 30.\n\nThe trucks were stranded at a military checkpoint due to a curfew set by the military. In March, the extremists ambushed Goneri village in Yobe State. The attack killed over 50 soldiers. In November 2018, more than one hundred Nigerian soldiers were reported killed in one single attack on an army base in Metele, Borno State. \u201cThe insurgents took us unawares,\u201d said an officer who spoke to Reuters. \u201cThe base was burned with arms and we lost about 100 soldiers. It is a huge loss.\u201d\n\nThat same year, 76 farm workers were slaughtered in rice fields near the village of Zabarmari. Boko Haram said the attack was waged to seek revenge on villagers for seizing the group\u2019s fighters and handing them over to the authorities.\n\nA floundering government\n\nFor a government big on optics and low on solutions, and keen to deodorise the noxious socio-political environment that has pitted the people against an administration that has failed to win the war it claims to have largely or technically won, the President and his officials have consistently doubled down on the lie that Boko Haram has been essentially defeated.\n\nLieutenant General Tukur Buratai, the immediate past and longest serving army Chief, on February 24, 2016, giddily yet falsely announced to members of the once vociferous but now largely noiseless Borno Elders Forum, \u201cwe were given three major tasks and we have made efforts toward achieving two. The first task is to defeat Boko Haram and I want to tell you that as of today Boko Haram has been defeated. When I say defeat, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there won\u2019t be hitches here and there. We have entered the mop-up stage of our operation\u201d.\n\nInformation minister, Lai Mohammed, in 2019 said, \u201cI stand by what I said that Boko Haram is technically defeated. What we are having today is global terrorism where you have the ISIS, ISWAP Al-Qaeda all working together\u201d.\n\nYet, just a year later, he complained that, \u201cterrorists use media and publicity as oxygen and so when they go on this kind of mindless killings, a dying terrorist group will suddenly spring to life. However, we must also understand that we are dealing with terrorists who are financed globally and we also need more support from global partners.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Nigeria had made attempts to acquire better and more effective platforms to deal with the terrorists, but for one reason or the other we have been denied these platforms,\u201d he said.\n\nIn February 2020, almost five years after claiming to have largely defeated Boko Haram, Mr. Buhari railed against the people of Borno State after being booed by the residents of the capital city, Maiduguri. He blamed the leaders of Borno communities for not doing enough in terms of cooperation with the military to end the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\n\u201cThis Boko Haram or whoever they are, cannot come up to Maiduguri or its environs to attack without the local leadership knowing\u2026 As the commander in chief, I will deal with the security situation\u201d, he said.\n\nOn March 23, 2020, Boko Haram launched a seven-hour assault on a Chadian army base at Bohoma that killed 93 Chadian soldiers, the deadliest-ever attack by Boko Haram on the country\u2019s military forces. In response Chadian President, Idriss Deby, adorned his army fatigues, rallied his forces from all fronts, and ramped up targeted and sweeping air, ground and amphibious operations against the terrorists. Tagged \u2018Operation Boma Anger\u2019, this military campaign was so effective that Boko Haram\u2019s hunted leader, Abubakar Shekau had to release a viral message to his fleeing fighters pleading with them not to run away from the battle but to \u201ctake heart\u201d as God was bigger than the army of Chad.\n\nObviously embarrassed by the tenacity and outcomes of the widely applauded Chadian offensive, Nigeria\u2019s Army Chief of Staff, Tukur Buratai announced that he was relocating to the North-East \u201cwhere he is overseeing and directing the overall operation in the theatre and other Nigerian Army operations across the country\u201d.\n\nTo many analysts, it was abundantly clear that it was the height of the usual government optics, nothing tangible ever came out of that hurriedly assembled relocation ordered by the President.\n\nIn December of that year, having been unable to deliver on his vow to defeat Boko Haram, Mr. Buratai shockingly predicted that Nigeria will most likely continue to suffer terrorist attacks for the next 20 years.\n\n\u201cThis crisis might not end in 20 years, \u201che had said. \u201cWe have achieved a lot of successes but we cannot continue to use the same tactics and achieve different results. It only depends on the level of escalation and the appropriate responses by all stakeholders both civil and military authorities. Also, by both local and international actors. Citizens\u2019 responsibility is equally important and imperative. All must cooperate to contain the lingering insecurity. Let there be collective action and responsibility,\u201d he had said.\n\nPerhaps basking in the euphoria of battlefield successes of 2015 and 2016, the former Nigerian Army Commander had been too quick to declare victory. Watchers of the Nigerian military do remember that in the midst of Nigeria\u2019s election season, and determined to ensure victory at the polls, then President Goodluck Jonathan in early 2015 ordered a renewed military offensive against Boko Haram. Led by then GOC of the 7 Division, Major-General Lamidi Adeosun, the Army began making headway against the group. The Nigerian Military, supported by private military contractors led by Eeben Barlow\u2019s \u2018Specialised Tasks, Training, Equipment and Protection International\u2019, STTEP, seized back most of the territory previously held by Boko Haram.\n\nIn February of that year, Monguno, the local government of Mr. Buhari\u2019s National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno as well as Marte local government were recaptured from Boko Haram. By the time Buhari assumed office in May 2015, practically all the territory under Boko Haram\u2019s control had been taken over by the Nigerian Military and that was why elections took place in all the local governments in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in 2015, and Buhari and his party won an overwhelming majority of votes in those states. The Tukur Buratai led Army from August 2015 merely consolidated on the initial victories chalked up by the pre-Buhari administration.\n\nBy mid-2017, the Nigerian Army had begun to lose the initiative and hand back territories to Boko Haram. In February this year, Boko Haram again hoisted its flag in Marte. In June 2020, at least 20 soldiers and more than 40 civilians were said to have been killed in twin attacks on Monguno and Nganzai, that came days after some 81 villagers were killed in Gubio. The loss of territories began with the removal of the Theatre Commander, Major-General Leo Irabor, now Chief of Defence Staff in May 2017 alongside the General Officer Commanding 7 Division, then Brigadier-General Emeka Ezeogwu and their replacement with Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru and Brigadier-General Ibrahim Yusuf, respectively.\n\nImmediate past governor of Borno state Kashim Shettima would later in 2018 decry this inopportune change when as governor he opined that the Boko Haram insurgency regained momentum in 2017 because of the failure of command at the theatre of war. He lamented, \u201cthe change of guard at the Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre Command which saw the replacement of Lucky Irabor, a Major General who is now at the Multinational Joint Task Force, did not help in sustaining the winning spirit of troops,\u201d adding that Major-General Ibrahim Attahiru \u201cdid not give a good account of himself as his tenure as Theatre Commander was greeted by embarrassing attacks on troops and civilians.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian state as the problem\n\nThe contest for political, economic and social power in Nigeria is largely driven by religion in Northern Nigeria, while ethnicity is the basis for power contestation in the South. That is why most violence in the North tends to have religious colourations even if it is really nothing more than a competition over a piece of land.\n\nNigeria has since the 1980s been characterised by varying forms of ethno-religious violence.\n\nBeginning with the Maitasine insurgency between 1979 and 1983 in which between 4000-6000 lost their lives, and trailed by a plethora of successive ethnic, religious and social upheavals in the 1980s and 1990s, the Nigerian state has unenthusiastically dealt with these nihilist insurgencies in a manner that laid the basis for the insurrection against the state by Boko Haram.\n\nSome of the prominent examples include those of the Kasuwan Magani in 1980, Zango Kataf and Gure-Kahugu in 1987, Kafanchan and Lere in 1987, Ilorin and Jerein 1989, Tafawa Balewa in 1991 as well as that of Zango Kataf in 1992, Kaduna in 2000, Jos in 2001. No part of Northern Nigeria has been immune of violence of one religious nature or the other\n\nPerpetrators of religious violence have rarely been brought to justice. There has been a long culture of appeasement of religion by successive Nigerian governments, which has culminated in the emboldening of religious zealots assured of almost a free pass by the Nigerian state. It is common in Nigeria to keep hearing of sponsors of Boko Haram and other violent actors, sometimes coming out of government circles, yet, no one is ever charged or outed. A former security officer agreed that \u201cwhen religious and communal conflicts occur, we tend to look purely at the political dimension without seeking to prosecute and punish criminal actors. Perhaps, if this is consistently done, it would make those who engineer these criminal activities to think twice\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Boko Haram militants: Six reasons they have not been defeated, by BBC\n\nThe inability of the Nigerian state to forcefully challenge political religion has led to new theatres of war in the north. This leads to the conclusion that the boldness of these new actors is linked to the government\u2019s inability to deal decisively with the crisis in the north-east.\n\nThus, the battle against Boko Haram can be justifiably termed the battle Nigeria was supposed to fight years and years ago but refused to.\n\nInternational dimension of Boko Haram\n\nIt has been suggested within intelligence circles both in Nigeria and outside, that the unending Boko Haram insurgency has its fibrous roots outside the country. There is ample evidence as consistently stated by the leadership of the United States Africa Command and supported by intelligence reports by Nigeria\u2019s different intelligence services, that Boko Haram has over time received training, funding and logistic support from Islamist elements in Mauritania, Al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) as well as from the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab responsible for the recent deadly terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nIn March 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Abubakar Shekau, the group\u2019s then leader, said, \u201cWe announce our allegiance to the caliph\u2026 and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity. We call on Muslims everywhere to pledge allegiance to the caliph.\u201d\n\nThus, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) was formed. With its most significant provinces in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nAfrica analyst, Jacob Zenn, noted that, as ISIS faced defeat and began losing its \u201cterritorial caliphate\u201d in Iraq and Syria, the terror group\u2019s leadership knew that the organisation would have to depend on external \u201cprovinces\u201d (called wilayat) to keep its global project thriving. The provinces would launch attacks and remain loyal to ISIS, and ISIS could claim that the \u201ccaliphate\u201d might no longer be expanding, but it was remaining. With setbacks in Afghanistan and the Philippines, Africa emerged as the only continent where ISIS could operate like it did in Syria and Iraq during its heyday. So long as ISIS thrives in Africa, the dream of the global caliphate remains alive.\n\nNot only can ISIS conduct sophisticated attacks in Africa, it also can occupy territories and overpower armies. Moreover, with rapidly increasing populations, historical narratives about reviving pre-colonial Islamic states, and challenges resulting from weak governance and security forces\u2019 abuses, ISIS finds fertile ground on the continent.\n\nBy June 2019, ISWAP was becoming ISIS\u2019s strongest external province. ISIS\u2019s influence had become so strong in the Sahel and Lake Chad region that it could order the capture and execution of Boko Haram\u2019s leader and one time ISIS ally, Abubakar Shekau.\n\nShekau, one of the most notorious leaders of Islamic militant groups anywhere in the world, died in May after detonating an explosive device while being pursued by fighters from ISWAP. The ISWAP fighters had stormed the Sambisa Forest, a swath of strategically important dense forest in Nigeria\u2019s north-east, which was Shekau\u2019s base.\n\nBulama Bukarti, an analyst specialising in Boko Haram at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, told Reuters after Shekau\u2019s death that Islamic State \u201cis consolidating the whole area, the Lake Chad region and Shekau\u2019s stronghold\u201d.\n\nCorruption benefits Boko Haram\n\nNigeria\u2019s military budgetary allocation is higher than the budgets of all other West African countries\u2019 defence or military operations put together. In 2020, military expenditure for Nigeria was $2,568 billion. Between 2015 and 2020, $11, 881 billion was spent on the military with little accruing to the country by way of peace.\n\nOn the contrary, the frontiers of violence in the country have expanded widely since 2015, as the military have been hampered by an equally dangerous enemy \u2013 corruption.\n\nTransparency International (TI) in a 2014 report noted that Nigerian military officers, politicians and other elites have enriched themselves by diverting money that was meant to fight terror. Since defence makes up 20 percent of Nigeria\u2019s budget, it is an attractive target.\n\nSeven years later, nothing has changed. Two retired army generals agreed that a lot of the budgetary allocations to the armed forces disappeared through bribes, payments to \u201cghost soldiers\u201d who don\u2019t exist, and through contracts not tendered and contested for, resulting in inflated spending that benefits politically-connected contractors.\n\n\u201cIf you want to solve the Boko Haram issue, follow the money\u201d, one said. He added that corruption is the biggest driver of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe lack of an updated, published defence policy weakens the accountability of the whole defence sector and makes scrutiny over defence matters, including budget and acquisition planning, harder.\n\nTransparency International in its 2020 Government Defence and Security report noted that while, \u201cthe annual defence budget is publicly available but the percentage of secret spending related to national security and intelligence services is difficult to establish, and off-budget expenditures are permitted by law, which often allows for non-orthodox practices, such as the \u2018security vote\u2019 to take place\u201d.\n\nIt further noted, \u201cSoldiers\u2019 payments are often irregular and hardly adequate in Nigeria, which has an impact on the motivation of its troops; this increases the likelihood of the phenomenon of the ghost soldiers, which is significant in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nOn corruption as an operational risk to the Nigerian military, the report gathered that, \u201cWhile corruption is recognised as an issue to be addressed within military circles, corruption is not systematically identified at the operational planning stage and is not seen as requiring contingency planning. There is no evidence of systematic corruption risk monitoring during operations.\n\n\u201cThere is provision made for training on issues relating to corruption, but it tends to be ad hoc and the connection between corruption, operational efficiency, and effectiveness could be emphasised further. The engagement of private military contractors in operations is unregulated, nor subject to scrutiny, and its costs are off-budget, meaning that private military contractors have access to significant power in an unregulated manner\u201d.\n\nIt further added that the procurement in the military is fraught with irregularities. Scrutiny, it said over matters of defence procurement \u201cis very limited in Nigeria. The Public Procurement Act excludes sensitive acquisitions relating to defence or security from its purview unless otherwise stated by the President, often resulting in significant expenditure going unscrutinised. Additionally, the lack of an updated defence policy contributes to the hardship in effectively scrutinising the sector\u2019s financial activities; for example, it makes the needs assessment phase of the budget cycle difficult to scrutinise and purchases are often ad hoc, rather than part of a long-term strategic acquisition plan. Information on the defence procurement cycle is not disclosed to the public and the National Assembly and external bodies play a marginal role in overseeing the process. Other unorthodox practices are also widespread, including security votes and single sourcing\u201d.\n\nEnding the war \u2013 What kind of reforms are needed?\n\nThe reality of terrorism and other anti-state violence is the exploitation of the inherent weaknesses in the operational capacity of the military in order to demean the authority of the state and vitiate the legitimacy of the government of the day. A weak security infrastructure certainly means a weak government. What is not in doubt, is that the Nigerian security services; including the military, police and special services, are not fit for purpose, as alleged by many Nigerians. They are operationally deficient, institutionally weak and structurally decayed.\n\nAs aptly noted in a June 2016 Crisis group report, \u201cthe decline began during 33 years of military dictatorship that took a serious toll on professionalism, operational effectiveness and accountability\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian military, which used to be among the continent\u2019s strongest and a backbone of regional and global peacekeeping efforts, has become a blemished force; suffering from an acute readiness crisis. It is overstretched, under-manned, grossly under-equipped, ill-trained, and poorly led. Even more unpleasant is the fact that the three services are locked in intense unhealthy competition, with neither the administrative head of the military (Minister of Defence) nor the operational head (Chief of Defence Staff) able to arbitrate.\n\nThis has resulted in lone wolf approaches to operations; with individual services working in silos rather than in concert, thus imperilling the counterterror/counterinsurgencies campaigns across the country. In addition, this obvious lack of operational and administrative oversight has resulted in the services pursuing prestige projects with no real value to operational capacity, frittering away already hard to get and inadequate resources.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2019, Nigeria\u2019s expenditure on military remained stable at around 0.5 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. In 2019, the military spending amounted to 0.46 percent of the gross domestic product.\n\nAfter decades of underfunding the military, Nigeria\u2019s defence budget has increased substantially during the past 10 years. Yet the performance of the country\u2019s military remains poor. And the country\u2019s security challenges continue as can be seen from the latest data from the 2019 Global Terrorism Index report which ranked Nigeria as the third-worst nation prone to terrorism with no improvement since 2017.\n\nWith this heavy expenditure, why are the outcomes so poor?\n\nAnti-corruption/transparency\n\nIt is more than obvious that the inability to get positive outcomes is due to the never-ending corruption prevalent in the military hierarchy in which budgetary allocations meant for military-centric activities are deployed to procure office goods, services, building structures, and overseas trips. In addition, there is also clear and irrefutable evidence that corrupt and incompetent security chiefs have turned the nation\u2019s security into a \u201cbusiness venture\u201d, thus jeopardising the capacity of the military to access effective and efficient resources and assets to defend the nation\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nTraining and doctrine\n\nThe challenge facing the Nigerian military, as clearly evident over the last decade, is to train a force that is capable of winning wars. The operational environment and the changing Character of warfare necessitate a change in the way officers and men are recruited, trained, deployed and promoted.\n\nIn the conflict against Boko Haram, we have seen whole battalions running away from the battlefield, and cases of soldiers losing their will to fight. While access to efficient equipment has been cited as the main reason for this, it is obvious that it is a secondary reason.\n\nThere is ample evidence that soldiers from Niger, Chad and Cameroon are no better resourced than their Nigerian counterparts, yet they have proved to be more zealous on the battlefield and keener to take risks.\n\nOne of the critical factors responsible for this lethargic approach by the Nigerian military is the methodology for recruiting officers and soldiers, the manner of training and on-boarding, as well as the methodology for deploying and promoting them.\n\nThe Nigerian military has over the years become a \u2018tribal employment portal\u2019 where emphasis is placed on language, tribe and religion at the expense of capability, efficiency and merit.\n\nThe resultant outcome is a large corps of officers and men incapable of securing the country and unwilling to put their \u2018best foot\u2019 forward in the arena of battle. The reason is not hard to fathom; many joined the military not out of patriotism and a willingness to serve, but out of material need for a source of regular income.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need to redefine who can become a soldier and how that process takes place. The distorted system of recruitment, postings, transfers, promotions, rewards and punishment needs a complete overhaul to engender patriotism and selflessness and thus, get the best of the best into the military.\n\nFurthermore, the deployment of soldiers for internal security operations such as anti-kidnapping, anti-crime and anti-cultism operations completely negates the training and doctrine as well as the responsibilities of the military.\n\nThe end result has been the erosion of the professionalism of soldiers as well as the vitiation of their distinctive soldierly quality as they get more and more involved in civilian matters.\n\nTo reverse this trend, it is more than important that the Police is encouraged and well-resourced to take on their assigned responsibilities of fighting crime and criminality in order to relieve the military of such extraneous duties that add no value to the capability of the military.\n\nFurthermore, there is a pressing imperative to interrogate the method of appointing the leadership of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Pertinent questions to ask in this regard include: Must ethnicity and religion be the yardstick for determining who heads the varied services or should clear evidence of academic, operations, leadership and management capability be the sensible criteria?\n\nShould course mates and seniors of newly appointed chiefs who aren\u2019t due for retirement be forced to resign, thus depleting the services of well-trained officers and managers. Isn\u2019t it reasonable and more compelling for the country and the military that those who are willing to continue serving be allowed to do so? Shouldn\u2019t service chiefs be constitutionally allowed to serve two terms of two years each in order to insulate them from political influence of the executive leadership? Isn\u2019t there a need to place an embargo on the promotion of senior officers in the military until such a time when the major conflict in the north-east has been decisively won?",

          "text": "Over $40.6 billion worth of foreign investments were diverted from the Nigerian economy in 2020 alone as a result of insecurity. This is equivalent to 1.5 percent of global GDP.\n\nNigeria is currently grappling with security challenges ranging from farmer/herder clashes, cattle rustling, banditry, kidnapping and Boko Haram insurgency. Boko Haram is translated from Hausa to mean \u201cWestern education is forbidden\u201d.\n\nFor many Nigerians, especially those in the northern part of the country, Boko Haram is associated with the loss of loved ones, property, and means of livelihood. From the findings of the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), Boko Haram is the deadliest terrorist group in the world and their focus is Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nThe terrorist group has caused massive destruction across northern Nigeria in the last decade. Aside from the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014 which made global headlines, many more attacks launched by the group have resulted in several deaths and altered lives forever.\n\nThe atmosphere in and around many towns in North-East Borno State is as tense as ever, as lives and properties are still being taken by the terrorists.\n\nRecently, the state has been ravaged by a deadly conflict between the military and the Boko Haram jihadists. Some time ago, the authorities announced they wanted to close the Borno refugee camps as they claimed the insurgency was almost eradicated. However, in recent months, deadly attacks have taken place on the outskirts of the regional capital Maiduguri.\n\nThe persistent issue of insecurity in Nigeria has been fingered as a major reason behind foreign investors pulling out their investments from the country.\n\n\u201cThe direct costs associated with violence include the immediate consequences on the victims, perpetrators, and public systems including health, judicial and public safety. The indirect cost of violence refers to longer-term costs such as lost productivity and investments, resulting from the physical and psychological effects and the impact of violence on the perception of safety and security in society,\u201d the global peace report indicated.\n\nMichael Ogunremi, a macro-economist and fixed-income analyst at Chapel Hill Denham stated that the current insecurity levels in Nigeria are most likely going to hamper the influx of foreign direct investments considering the unattractive nature of the country\u2019s macroeconomic environment.\n\n\u201cI think insecurity is a serious concern because if I were a foreign investor, I wouldn\u2019t want to visit states like Borno, Kaduna, or most northern states in general. As an investor, the risk perception for investing in those parts of the country seriously outweighs any benefits that can be realised from such a venture,\u201d Ogunremi stated.\n\n\u201cThe major disadvantage of insecurity is that it affects tourism, foreign direct investment, and foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) because there is the make-belief that FPI\u2019s are mostly influenced by interest rates. However, there are also macro-economic sentiments that also come into play in these situations,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIndeed, consumer companies stand to reap the dividends of peace in northern Nigeria if the military can bring to an end the activities of Boko Haram in those regions,\u201d Ogunremi noted.\n\nGrowing insecurity in Nigeria in recent years has coincided with rising poverty levels as the country now has an estimated 91 million people (43% of its population) living in extreme poverty (less than $2 a day). This is up 29 percent from 70 million in 2016 and this is projected to reach 106.6 million by 2030. Nigeria is now regarded as the world\u2019s poverty capital.\n\nThe disruption to lives and livelihoods and the surge in the number of internally displaced people (IDPs) are on the verge of triggering a humanitarian crisis. Many displaced people are being prevented from accessing vital services such as healthcare, and farmers are unable to plant or harvest crops.\n\nIn some cases, armed bandits insist on payments before farmers can have access to farmlands in the planting season. They return during the harvest season and extort farmers before access is granted to their farms. This has led to scarcity and a surge in the prices of certain food commodities.\n\nRead Also: Insecurity frustrates billion-naira interventions in farming\n\nInsecurity\n\nAccording to ReliefWeb, as much as 5.1 million Nigerians are estimated to be at high risk of being critically food insecure between June and November 2021. This situation is exacerbated by the second wave of COVID-19 in which Borno, Adamawa, Yobe States (Boko Haram hotspots) have recorded new cases.\n\nWhat began as localised clashes between farmers and herders over access to land has degenerated into a major conflict and loss of lives across the north. In late 2020, dozens of rice farmers were massacred in Borno State.\n\nAccording to the Global Terrorism Index, Nigeria is the third most terrorised country in the world, after Afghanistan and Iraq. Total terror-related deaths were estimated at 1,245 in 2019 and 1,606 in 2020. Total deaths are estimated at 22,441 since 2001.\n\nAccording to an email sent from the office of the vice president to Bloomberg, it stated that \u201cthe Boko Haram insurgency has caused $9 billion of damage in six northern Nigerian states since 2011.\u201d\n\nThe frequency of these attacks suggests that the battle against the insurgents is far from over. Although military offensive strategies have made significant headway in crippling Boko Haram\u2019s activities, the group, however, appears relentless, and has maintained intermittent attacks and kidnapping.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has made a specific commitment to combat terrorism, but the recent intensified efforts by Boko Haram suggest the goal of restoring peace to the northern region is still a far reach.\n\nNigeria\u2019s minister of power, Aliyu Abubakar at a town hall meeting in Maiduguri on Thursday stated that the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) lost N1.7 billion in nine months owing to vandalism of electricity infrastructure in Maiduguri and environs. He added that in one month, TCN lost an average of N139 million on the wheeling charges and energy lost in the area.\n\n\u201cThis misappropriation of funds to vandalised projects rather than our citizens is what is driving the country\u2019s poverty level to record highs,\u201d Abubakar stated.\n\nData from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed that Nigeria spent N258.3bn on wheat importation in the first three months of 2021. Recent reports indicate that efforts at boosting local wheat production in recent years have been undermined by the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-Eastern region of the country, as wheat farmers in Borno, the country\u2019s major producing state have abandoned their farmlands and fled to other regions for safety.\n\nPresident of the Wheat Growers Association of Nigeria noted that the insurgency in the North-Eastern region has been a major setback to efforts at increasing wheat production, noting that Borno alone contributed 30 percent to the country\u2019s total output before the insurgency but now contributes nothing.\n\nNigeria remains a net importer of wheat, though there exists a 5 percent tariff on wheat imports, plus an additional 15 percent levy for the national wheat development programme.\n\nBorno, Bauchi, Yobe, Kano, Jigawa, and Zamfara States are major wheat producers and these states are currently undergoing military operations in the fight against terrorists and bandits. These restrictions make it difficult for farmers to access their farms. These unfortunate events have led to a spike in food prices reflected in the food inflation rate and by extension headline inflation.",

          "title": "Clubfoot: Nigerian surgeon, American partners bring succour to hundreds of children",
          "text": "An orthopaedic surgeon at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Umuahia, in Abia State, Peace Amaraegbulam, observed that the Nigerian children she had encountered, who had cerebral palsy, lacked access to quality medical care and social support.\n\nCerebral palsy is a brain-related disability that makes movement and balance difficult.\n\nTo contribute to improving the situation, in November 2017, Mrs Amaraegbulam founded The Straight Child Foundation (TSCF), a nonprofit, as a platform for providing support to children with the condition.\n\nBut what Mrs Amaraegbulam did not know was that she was also creating an opening that would, a year later, allow children with foot deformities to access free and effective treatment.\n\nAs an orthopaedic surgeon at FMC Umuahia, part of Mrs Amaraegbulam\u2019s work is treating children with clubfoot, a congenital (present-at-birth) deformity that twists the foot inward and downward, causing the child to walk by the side of their foot with much pain and difficulty.\n\nAbout 9,000 of Nigeria\u2019s seven million yearly newborns have clubfoot. That is 4.5 per cent of the global 200,000 annual incidences. But because out-of-pocket treatment per case could cost as much as N200,000 ($485), according to Uchenna Oluwatosin, head of the Physiotherapy department at FMC, one of several hindrances to effective treatment in Nigeria is the lack of funds to commence or conclude treatment.\n\nThankfully, children in six Nigerian states can now access free and effective treatment. The events that birthed the solution began when Mrs Amaraegbulam travelled to the U.S. in early 2018 as a scholar under the International Surgical Skills Scholarship of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, which included a one-week observership at Columbia University in New York where she had a mentor in Joshua Hyman, a Professor of orthopaedic surgery at the university.\n\nMiraclefeet\n\nDuring one of their in-person chats, Mr Hyman, who is also a medical advisory board member at Miraclefeet (a U.S.-based nonprofit supporting care providers across 29 countries to increase access to effective clubfoot treatment), inquired about what challenges Mrs Amaraegbulam was facing with her clubfoot patients back in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI told him that many parents were not able to complete the Ponseti care for their children, and a lot of time, they are not able to provide the casting materials. They are not able to afford the braces for the maintenance,\u201d she explained.\n\nAfter hearing this, Mr Hyman suggested that Miraclefeet could extend its support to Nigeria and that Mrs Amaraegbulam\u2019s nonprofit and FMC could be its gateway into the country.\n\nHe then promised to share the idea with Miraclefeet for possible consideration. And when he did, it sounded like something Miraclefeet had been waiting for.\n\n\u201cIt was very helpful for us that there was an existing organisation trusted and recommended by one of our advisory board members,\u201d No\u00e9 Rajerison, Miraclefeet\u2019s associate director of programmes, said.\n\nIn the months following, Miraclefeet entered a partnership with TSCF to create awareness about clubfoot in Nigeria and provide free treatment, beginning with a clinic at the FMC Umuahia where Mrs Amaraegbulam works. Miraclefeet\u2019s representatives arrived in Nigeria and trained staff of TSCF and other volunteers from FMC Umuahia in a clubfoot treatment method called Ponseti. It also committed to providing all the treatment materials for free every quarter while FMC provided space as a clubfoot clinic where children with the deformity can access free care every Thursday.\n\nPonseti treatment method\n\nSo what is Ponseti about?\n\nThere are several treatment methods for clubfoot. But Ponseti, which is non-surgical, is globally accepted to be cost-effective and records over 95 per cent success in treatment outcomes, especially for under-two children. It involves casting and bracing phases, otherwise called correction and maintenance.\n\nThe correction phase lasts between five to eight weeks. It involves a caregiver gently manipulating the foot upward and forward every week and casting the foot with Plaster of Paris or POP (a powder-made plaster applied after being soaked in water and capable of sticking when dry) to hold the foot to the desired position and prevent it from jerking back to its pre-manipulation state.\n\nThe correction phase ends only when each of the four fundamental components of a clubfoot case is corrected, with each week\u2019s manipulation and casting intended to fix at least one component.\n\nMr Oluwatosin, the head of the physiotherapy department at FMC, identified these components as CAVE; C for cavus (a deformity in the midfoot); A for adductus (an anomaly in the foot\u2019s middle bones), V for varus (a defect in the foot\u2019s forefront), and E for equinus (an ankle deformity bending the foot downward).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaintenance Phase\n\nThe maintenance phase is done using braces. A brace comprises a special shoe (or boot) and a bar as long as the distance between the child\u2019s shoulders. When the child wears the shoes, the shoe\u2019s bottom is clipped to the bar, allowing each leg and foot to keep a degree of distance from each other to sustain the upward and forward correction.\n\nThree months into the maintenance phase, the child wears the brace for 23 hours every day. After three months, the child continues to wear it but only while sleeping for at least three years.\n\nTo encourage parents to bring their children to FMC for treatment, Miraclefeet supports TSCF to take awareness programmes to local communities in Abia State \u2013 working with community leaders to educate families about the deformity and availability of free treatment, and collaborating with primary healthcare centres to refer cases to FMC Umuahia.\n\nThrough this process, 202 children have had their feet corrected at FMC Umuahia free of charge since July 2018. That is massive, said Mrs Amaraegbulam, who added that until Miraclefeet came in, the number of clubfoot patients she saw since she started working at FMC Umuahia in 2015 were very few.\n\n\u2018Start small and then grow bigger\u2019\n\nBut for Miraclefeet, FMC was just a test ground for something bigger because, since 2019, it has expanded care to five additional hospitals in five states: Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Anambra; University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Akwa Ibom; Irua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo; Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Ebonyi; and Federal Medical Centre, Kogi.\n\n\u201cWhen we go into a new country, we start small and then grow bigger year after year,\u201d said Mr Rajerison. \u201cAnd TSCF had a great team who could help test and refine clubfoot programme strategies that work in Nigeria to hopefully scale to other regions.\u201d\n\nTogether, the six centres have treated 583 cases, one of them being one-year-and-four-months-old Winner Chinonso who had clubfoot on both feet.\n\nBefore Winner turned five months old, Peculiar, his mother, saw a post on Facebook about the free treatment at FMC. She travelled with him every week from Aba to FMC (about one hour-10-minutes journey by commercial bus) for treatment. Winner is on braces now; his feet look normal, and he walks and plays freely with other children.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I would just tell myself, if it wasn\u2019t corrected, I wouldn\u2019t have been happy in this my life because I know each time I look at his feet, I would really feel sad,\u201d 29-year-old Peculiar said. \u201cI am just happy that looking at him now, his feet are okay, and he can walk.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Miraclefeet plans to add two extra clinics before the end of this year, with a target to scale the programme to a national level with time and help integrate it into the public health system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working diligently with our local partner(s) and strategic allies to ensure that we eliminate disability caused by clubfoot in Nigeria,\u201d Emmanuel Otoo, Miraclefeet\u2019s director of programmes, said. But he acknowledges that a multi-group collaboration is required to achieve the target.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to own a national programme, it\u2019s important for affiliated community-based and public health groups to have some key skills \u2013 organisational, advocacy, negotiation, resource mobilisation, human resources,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that we advocate to ensure the government, through the relevant ministries, takes the responsibility for driving the agenda of quality and timely clubfoot treatment while MiracleFeet provides support,\u201d Mr Otoo said.",

          "text": "Uche Chris\n\nThe crisis in the south east region of the country orchestrated by the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, is entering a dangerous phase that will severely destabilize the region, and undermine the legitimacy of President Buhari and his government.\n\nIPOB\u2019s threat to imposed a lockdown on the region for a month if the government fails to produce their leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, on the next court hearing date of October 21, 2021, should not be dismissed as usual, because it portends serious implications for the government.\n\nAlthough this call may be a shot in the dark given government rigidity and lack of tact in handling such issues, however, this particular situation with IPOB is deserving of some creative strategy and different approach, because in the end government will be the loser. It is like fighting with a man who is already down; any outcome is a victory for him.\n\nIt was the same mistake government made with the Islamic movement in Nigeria, IMN, when, even though proscribed, continued to defy government until they got their wish, which was the release of their leader, Sheik El Zakzakky and his wife. In the end government was the loser, as it failed to curtail their processions right under its noses in Abuja.\n\nAs predictable as President Buhari is in handling such issues, he should expect a bloody nose if he sticks to his well-worn path of jack-boot tactic of political engagement with dissident groups and agitators. This is a litmus test that will define the integrity, sensitivity and legitimacy of his government in relation to the Igbo.\n\nIPOB has demonstrated capacity to imposed its will and mandate on the region, even in the face of massive deployment of violent force against it. For several weeks now the south east has been on partial lockdown every Monday on the directive of the group even after it had been apparent called off.\n\nIt will take a total declaration of war against the group to stop and stifle its threat, and government has proved incapable of enforcing its position over that of IPOB. So, in the end, it is IPOB\u2019s position that will prevail; even a partial observance of its order is a massive victory.\n\nLike Boko Haram, government actions have radicalized the group, which started as a nonviolent; and no force can stop a people, who are ready to die for their cause. Government should be careful of opening another insurgency in the region, which may portend danger for the nation.\n\nGovernment may want to use this as a pretext to destroy south east economy, but it should realize that the wealth of the south east is not within the region. That is the lesson from the apparent success of IPOB because it is a world-wide movement.\n\nGovernment has not shown moral superiority in dealing with opposition and agitators. You do not break the law to enforce it; that is Machiavellian and has no place in modern democracy for whatever it is worth. Fundamental rights are the foundations of any democracy and its violation without legitimate cause and opportunity for redress before the court is descent to dictatorship.\n\nThis behaviour by government has been repeated so many times that it is difficult for government to appeal to rule of law, as justification for its actions. Kanu, like El Zakzakky, may have broken the law as defined by government, but they are entitled to a fair trial, which includes, right to their counsel of choice, appearance at trial, which is now the bone of contention, and right to bail, as may be determined by the court.\n\nGovernment cannot be a judge and jury; it is the reason we have separationof powers.Government cannot lock up a citizen indefinitely at its own discretion without the authority of the court. It is even executive rascality for it to defy court decision to release accused persons on bail, as it has done in the cases of Col. Dasuki and Zakzakky.\n\nEven the mode of bringing Kanu back to the country raises serious question and doubt over government\u2019s commitment to rule of law and justice; because an illegal means cannot produce a legal and just end.As Lawyers are wont to say, you can\u2019t build something on nothing.\n\nObviously, government has boxed itself into a corner; bringing Kanu back in the manner it did was a terrible mistake and strategic failure. What was the strategic objective? It may seem a personal policy success for President Buhari and his minders, but it was a huge political blunder that will dog the administration till its leaves office as long as the trial lasts.\n\nThe purported damage Kanu was doing to the image of government abroad will not compare to the political liability he will become to government going forward, because every court day will be a reminder of the high-handedness and criminal nature of his arrest, trial and treatment, which will further embolden his supporters home and abroad.\n\nIt is a pyrrhic victory that only appeals to ego and hubris. This could have been avoided because government will suffer more bad publicity with him in Nigeria facing trial than outside, especially if IPOB make good the threat. Unfortunately, bringing Kanu to court will be a victory for IPOB, as its members and other co-travelers and political jobbers will capitalize on the opportunity to further damage government image.\n\nIMN has provided a civil template to demonise government for perceived unjust actions.Government may have the law on its side but it does not have morality and public perception, which are superior to law in the eye of the people.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe composition of the Board and Management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited recently approved by President Mohammadu Buhari, may have left those expecting equity and fair play from the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 disappointed.\n\nBuhari, who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum Resources had in consonance with Section 53(1) of the Act directed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited be incorporated.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Sunday (September 19), the President appointed the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Mele Kyari (North East), as the Chief Executive Officer while Senator Ifeanyi Ararume will serve as the Chairman of the Board, with Umar I. Ajiya as the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nOther board members are; Dr Tajudeen Umar (North East), Mrs Lami O. Ahmed (North Central), Mallam Mohammed Lawal (North West), Senator Margaret Chuba Okadigbo (South East), Barrister Constance Harry Marshal (South South), and Chief Pius Akinyelure (South West).\n\n\u201cThis is in consonance with Section 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, which requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of commencement of the Act in consultation with the Minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the Company,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nObservers believe that the development is not any different from the status quo as analysis of top management of the NNPC and its subsidiaries shows an uneven geographical spread of senior appointments.\n\nMr. Kyari, while announcing the reshuffling of the senior leadership of the NNPC in July 2020, said the appointments and redeployment of some top officers were in line with the corporation\u2019s vision of Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE).\n\nHowever, a scrutiny of the top cadre staff at the NNPC by reputable agencies monitored by Business Hallmark reveals a geographical imbalance within the ranks of the corporation.\n\nHence the North-East, North-West and North-Central occupy 60 per cent of all the appointments. Women, on the other hand, constitute only 25 per cent of NNPC\u2019s top management.\n\nOut of 40 senior management positions within the NNPC ranging from chief operating officers and managing directors of its subsidiaries to general managers\u2019 roles in the corporation, 24 are occupied by Nigerians from the North while 16 are headed by those from the South.\n\nOn the website of the NNPC, the internal executive board of the NNPC consists of the GMD of the corporation Kyari who hails from the North-East, alongside eight other board members.\n\nThe total representation comprises two from North-East, two from North-West, one from North-Central, one from South-South and one from the South-West.\n\nThe list is as follows: Chief Operating Officer (COO) in charge of refineries Mustapha Yinusa Yakubu (North-Central); Chief Financial Officer in charge of Accounts and Finance Umar Isa Ajiya (North-West); COO, Gas and Power Yusuf Usman (North East); while COO overseeing ventures and investments is Adeyemi Adetunji (South-West).\n\nOthers are COO in charge of Upstream Tombomieye Adokiye from South-South; COO, Corporate Services Mohammed Abdulkabir Ahmed (North West), and corporation\u2019s legal adviser Hadiza Coomassie from North-West. The position of the COO, Downstream, which was vacated by Ndupu Lawrencia from South-East, who retired early in the year, is yet to be filled.\n\nThe South-East has no representation in the internal board of the NNPC, which is saddled with running the day-to-day activities of the corporation. Yet, the region has two oil-producing states -Imo and Abia.\n\nThe NNPC\u2019s investment management unit, made up of its subsidiaries and associated companies, has been its most profitable, reporting revenue of N5.04 trillion and a profit of N1.01 trillion in 2018, but its four decrepit refineries posted N154 billion loss within the year.\n\nThey recorded more losses in 2019.\n\nOf 21 subsidiaries and associated companies of the NNPC that were assessed, 16 of the chief executive officers (CEOs) managing the companies are from the North, accounting for 76.1 per cent. On the other hand, only five are from the South, indicating 23.9 per cent.\n\nAccording to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITII the most profitable subsidiary of the NNPC is Integrated Data Sciences Limited (IDSL) headed by Ayebateke Bariwei (South-South), registering a N23 billion increase in profits in 2019.\n\nOther top earners for the NNPC in 2019 were: Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) headed by Sambo Mansur (North-East); National Petroleum Investment Management Service (NAPIMS) which is headed by Bala Wunti(North-East); Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) headed by Musa Lawan(North), and Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC) headed by Usman Farouk(North).\n\nLast month, the corporation announced the promotion and redeployment of some staff to fill vacant positions, as well as the disengagement of a chief operating officer.\n\nGroup General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Kennie Obateru, announced in a statement issued in Abuja that Billy Okoye had been appointed the new Group Executive Director, Ventures and Business Development, while Aisha Ahmadu-Katagum was promoted to the position of Group Executive Director, Corporate Services.\n\n\u201cUntil their new appointments, Mr. Okoye and Mrs. Ahmadu-Katagum were Group General Managers, Crude Oil Marketing Division and Supply Chain Management Division in the corporation, respectively,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nIt added that Adeyemi Adetunji, formerly Chief Operating Officer, Business and Ventures Development, is now the Group Executive Director, Downstream; while Mohammed Ahmed, formerly Chief Operating Officer, Corporate Services, had now assumed the position of Group Executive Director, Gas and Power.\n\nNNPC stated that other Chief Operating Officer positions in the corporation had now been re-designated as Group Executive Directors, in alignment with the rules of Company and Allied Matters Act. This, it said, was preparatory to the new status of the corporation as a limited liability company, post-Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\n\u201cThe repositioning also saw the disengagement of Yusuf Usman, formerly Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power,\u201d the oil firm said.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe new appointments include that of Mr Garba-Deen Muhammad, who will take over from Dr. Kennie Obateru, as the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of the corporation.\u201d\n\nMr. Kyari said the new appointments would enable the corporation live up to the expectations of Nigerians, adding that the development would also enable the corporation achieve its vision of becoming a world-class energy company of choice.\n\nPANDEF Revolts\n\nAlleged lopsided appointment appointments into top management positions at the NNPC and its subsidiaries and departments in favour of the northern part of the country had last year seen a strong wave of upheaval and condemnation.\n\nThis was widely described as another demonstration of President Mohammadu Buhari\u2019s flagrant disregard for the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which stipulates that no tribe or ethnic region should be given undue preference over another, thereby fueling agitations in the country, especially in the South-East.\n\nThe Niger Delta leaders under the aegis of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), had ignited the fire of disapproval in an open letter entitled \u201cRe: Addressing the Continued Injustice Against the Niger Delta People Vis the Lopsided Appointments in the NNPC and its Subsidiaries/Departments\u201d, addressed to President Buhari..\n\nPANDEF, in the letter signed by its national publicity secretary, Ken Robinson, rejected the alleged deliberate and calculated sidelining of Niger Delta indigenes in appointments and redeployments in the NNPC and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe group said the region\u2019s marginalisation at the national oil corporation became even more pronounced in the March 2020 promotions and reorganization which, it said, further isolated the Niger Delta from its mainstream management structure.\n\nPANDEF stated, \u201cToday, under Mr President\u2019s watch, the paradoxical and dismal reality is that in the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), through which the federal government regulates and participates in the country\u2019s petroleum industry that operates in our backyards, virtually all top management positions of the corporation and its subsidiaries, departments, and ventures are held by persons from the northern zones of the country that do not produce an ounce of oil, to the exclusion of indigenes of oil producing communities of Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nPANDEF listed 20 management positions held by northerners in NNPC to include Group Managing Director (GMD), Mele Kyari; Chief Finance Officer, Finance and Accounts, Umar Ajiya; Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, Yusuf Usman; Chief Operating Officer, Corporate Services, Farouk Garba Sa\u2019id; Chief Operating Officer, Refining and Petrochemicals, Mustapha Yakubu; Corporate Secretary/Legal Adviser to the Corporation, Hadiza Coomassie; GGM, International Energy Relations, IER, Omar Ibrahim; GGM, Renewable Energy, Kallamu Abdullahi; GGM, Governance Risk and Compliance, Ibrahim Birma; and GGM, NAPIMS, Bala Wunti.\n\nOthers are MD, NNPC Shipping, Inuwa Waya; MD, Pipelines and Product Marketing, PPMC, Musa Lawan; MD, Nigeria Petroleum Development Company, NPDC, Mansur Sambo; MD, Duke Oil/NNPC Trading Company, Lawal Sade; MD, Port Harcourt Refining Company, Malami Shehu; MD, Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company, Muhammed Abah; MD, Nigeria Gas Marketing Company, Abdulkadir Ahmed; MD, Nigeria Gas and Power Investment Company Limited, Salihu Jamari; MD, NNPC Medical Services, Mohammed Zango; and Director, Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, Sarki Auwalu.\n\nAccording to PANDEF, the entire Southern Nigeria was allotted only three top management positions in the NNPC.",

          "text": "Few weeks ago on the 24th of July 2021, the chairmanship and councillorship election was held in Lagos state, and in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government of Lagos, Taiwo Adepoju was remembered, and the youth was expecting him to come out again to contest but the present government has been a threat to his life and freedom of movement, and with this development nobody knows his plans for now.\n\nIn 2013 Taiwo Adepoju came out on the platform of the (then existing) Labour Party to contest for the post of councillor in Ward E in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area of Lagos State.\n\nPolitical observers with an ear to the ground saw this as a deliberate strategy to buckle the usual orchestrated plan by the godfathers of the ruling party, the Action Congress in the local government who believed that they had the God given right to determine who would be where on the queue to the executive chairman\u2019s office and the legislative wing of the Local Government\n\nTaiwo was, and it would seem that, now, some 8 years later, still carries that same charismatic mien about him that made the age groups that would be referred to as the youth love and follow him.\n\nHe immediately, on pronouncing that he would be contesting on the platform of the Labour Party divided the old guard party stalwarts into a tiny fraction that felt he and thus by extension the youth of Ajegunle had a right to be represented in the election but this was only a tiny minority of the Godfathers. The inner circle of the \u2018Godfather council\u2019 would have nothing of such, and of course, the election, was just another opportunity for them to prove that they had the all electoral works in the kitty.\n\nTaiwo Adepoju lost the election.\n\nFast forward to some 8 years later and the repercussions of those years are still hunting Mr. Adepoju. When he decided to give the councillorship post another try in the year 2017 he got himself into what he describes as the scariest day of his life. On September 20, 2013 he organized a small party of close friends to celebrate his birthday and at the end of the party, on the way home, he was relieved of his car, at gunpoint, no less and advised to know that this was a lesson on \u201cparty affiliation\u201d.\n\nThe masked men stressed the \u201cparty affiliation\u201d phrase so well and so much that he was very much happy to repeat the phrase along with them. Other than brandishing the hand gun he was not harmed. The scars left behind were not physical but were enduring and eventually Taiwo scampered to the United Kingdom.\n\nA telephone conversation with him confirmed that he had been contacted even while in the Queen\u2019s land and reminded that the \u2018people\u2019 at home are still the same but they were not expecting him back, and they suggested that he should remain where he was.\n\nTaiwo says that, for now, he has \u201cdecided to take their advice\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Few weeks ago on the 24th of July 2021, the chairmanship and councillorship election was held in Lagos state, and in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government of Lagos, Taiwo Adepoju was remembered, and the youth was expecting him to come out again to contest but the present government has been a threat to his life and freedom of movement, and with this development nobody knows his plans for now.\n\nIn 2013 Taiwo Adepoju came out on the platform of the (then existing) Labour Party to contest for the post of councillor in Ward E in Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Area of Lagos State.\n\nPolitical observers with an ear to the ground saw this as a deliberate strategy to buckle the usual orchestrated plan by the godfathers of the ruling party, the Action Congress in the local government who believed that they had the God given right to determine who would be where on the queue to the executive chairman\u2019s office and the legislative wing of the Local Government\n\nTaiwo was, and it would seem that, now, some 8 years later, still carries that same charismatic mien about him that made the age groups that would be referred to as the youth love and follow him.\n\nHe immediately, on pronouncing that he would be contesting on the platform of the Labour Party divided the old guard party stalwarts into a tiny fraction that felt he and thus by extension the youth of Ajegunle had a right to be represented in the election but this was only a tiny minority of the Godfathers. The inner circle of the \u2018Godfather council\u2019 would have nothing of such, and of course, the election, was just another opportunity for them to prove that they had the all electoral works in the kitty.\n\nTaiwo Adepoju lost the election.\n\nFast forward to some 8 years later and the repercussions of those years are still hunting Mr. Adepoju. When he decided to give the councillorship post another try in the year 2017 he got himself into what he describes as the scariest day of his life. On September 20, 2013 he organized a small party of close friends to celebrate his birthday and at the end of the party, on the way home, he was relieved of his car, at gunpoint, no less and advised to know that this was a lesson on \u201cparty affiliation\u201d.\n\nThe masked men stressed the \u201cparty affiliation\u201d phrase so well and so much that he was very much happy to repeat the phrase along with them. Other than brandishing the hand gun he was not harmed. The scars left behind were not physical but were enduring and eventually Taiwo scampered to the United Kingdom.\n\nA telephone conversation with him confirmed that he had been contacted even while in the Queen\u2019s land and reminded that the \u2018people\u2019 at home are still the same but they were not expecting him back, and they suggested that he should remain where he was.\n\nTaiwo says that, for now, he has \u201cdecided to take their advice\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Banditry, kidnapping, others: FCT communities take to self-defence",
          "text": "Amidst growing insecurity and widespread cases of kidnapping in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, residents have resorted to self-help by forming vigilante groups across the six area councils to ward off armed bandits and kidnappers.\n\nOur investigations in satellite towns and in more than 30 communities located mostly in the outskirts of the metropolis, showed that vigilante groups are now the cardinal means of protecting lives and property of residents, who claimed official security agencies have become grossly inadequate in providing these services.\n\nResidents also said their decision to rely on the services of private security outfits arose from the repeated stringent calls by the leadership of official security agencies in the country and even state governors for citizens to rise up collectively against armed bandits and gun-trotting bandits and kidnappers ravaging their communities, kill, physically assault, rape their women, loot and destroy their properties at will.\n\nMagashi, Masari, others on \u2018self-help\u2019\n\nMinister of Defence Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd), Katsina state Governor Aminu Bello Masari, Afenifere, the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group among others, had in recent time urged individuals and communities to defend themselves against the menace of banditry and kidnapping.\n\nAlready, various regions have constituted regional security outfits such as Amotekun and Ebube Agu by the South-west and South-east governors, respectively.\n\nFCT residents heed call\n\nLamenting the incessant killings and cattle rustling in Abaji, kidnappings in Kuje, Gwagwalada, AMAC and Bwari area councils, residents said they were tired of waiting for the police and other security agencies.\n\nThe residents said they have taken the bull by the horns by confronting these miscreants upsetting the peace and order of their respective communities.\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint, Stumaje of Tungan \u2013Maje in Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Salihu Isiaku Na\u2019annabi, said: \u201cAt some point, it became obvious that our security agencies were almost overwhelmed by the activities of insurgents in some parts of the country and therefore were unable to pay adequate attention to and contain miscreants who were invading our communities.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, understandable that the residents of these communities, who were victims and are still at the receiving end of the vicious acts of miscreants, could no longer fold their hands and wait for the overworked security agencies to come to their rescue. We formed vigilante groups across our communities to safeguard our lives and protect our property and halt the frequent rape of our wives and daughters by criminal elements,\u201d the monarch said through the Palace Secretary, Abdulwaheed Salihu.\n\nSimilarly, another monarch and Etsu Giri Kpasere, Chief Dalatu Egari said the communities were prone to attacks by bandits and other criminal elements, hence their decision to opt for whatever legal means to defend themselves against them.\n\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t continue to allow these criminal elements to upset our peace. So, vigilantes seem a good complementary option to assist state security agencies to curb the menace of bandits and kidnappers,\u201d he said through his eldest son, Isah Dalatu Egari.\n\nCorroborating this position, the Odumi of Omoko, Mallam Umar Zozi, whose community is situated along Kwali-Abaji road, said they decided to form vigilante groups because members of the local security outfits know the terrain and can readily confront and contain the bandits and kidnappers\u2019 onslaughts.\n\nKillings and kidnappings in Abuja\n\nIn the last couple of months, a former Army Provost Marshal and Director, Veteran Affairs of the Nigerian Army, Major-General Husseini Ahmed, was killed by an armed gang along Lokoja-Abuja Road.\n\nPrior to that time, a former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh was shot dead following an attack on his vehicle along the Abuja-Keffi road while returning from his farm in Nasarawa state.\n\nSimilarly, unknown gunmen killed two naval officers along the Abuja-Lokoja highway, barely two months after the killing of a top army officer, GSM Abubakar, by suspected bandits along the same road.\n\nAlleged bandits also invaded herders\u2019 settlement and killed a 30-year-old man, Abdulmumin Jagaba, near Sabon-Gari village in Kwali Area Council.\n\nBesides, two herdsmen were killed at Paiko community in Gwagwalada, Kwankashe area in Madalla, another person killed while 12 others, mostly males, were abducted by gunmen.\n\nAlso, at Jikwoyi/Kurudu area of Abuja satellite town, unknown gunmen killed a pastor, identified as Emeka Evans, inside his church during a vigil.\n\nKidnappings\n\nCases of kidnappings in the FCT have mostly occurred at the outskirts of the metropolis except few instances like the kidnapping of Channels Television reporter, Friday Okeregbe and a Punch correspondent, Okechukwu Nnodim, at different times.\n\nHowever, Pegi, Dafara, Gaube, Kiyi, all in Kuje; Mpape, Nuelege, along the Airport road, villages around Bassa near the Nigerian Air Force facility few kilometres away from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, all in AMAC, seem to be the haven of kidnappers who have in the last one year abducted for ransom no fewer than 25 persons. Currently, a mother and her two teenage daughters abducted penultimate Sunday in Pegi are still in the kidnappers\u2019 den as at the time of this report.\n\nWe learnt that abduction for ransom is a regular occurrence in Mpape as people are said to be abducted and the family compelled to pay as paltry as N100, 000, sometimes.\n\nA resident, Ishaku Yamusa, said: \u201cWe live in fear because of the activities of kidnappers who abduct and demand even N100, 000 before the release of their captors. Sadly, these abductions are hardly reported by the media.\u201d\n\nAnother resident in Yaba, Abaji, a farming community which shares border with Niger state, Moses, disclosed that there have been cases of cattle rustling and kidnappings, none of which, according to him, found a space in the media.\n\n\u201cSo forming vigilante groups to checkmate the activities of these vagrant criminals required little persuasion of residents who cherished their safety and peace,\u201d he said.\n\nCommunities visited\n\nIn course of our investigation, we visited Kubwa, Lugbe (the side where VON is located), Aco, Gwagwalada, Bwari, all satellite towns and more than 30 communities, including Yaba in Abaji, Omoko, Ohonu. All the villages along the Airport road, including Ido and surrounding villages opposite the University of Abuja, Kiyi near the Ghana-Nigeria International School, Kuje, Chukun along Kuje \u2013 Gwagwalada road. Dafara, Gaube, Tunga Maje, Anagada, and surrounding settlements along Zuba-Gwagwalada road, Nyanya villages, Karu, Jikwoyi Phases 1- 5, Dakwa and five villages that constitute Garam along Bwari- Kaduna road, as well as villages after the Apo Spare Parts Market.\n\n\u2018Why we armed vigilante groups\u2019\n\n\u201cWithout arming the vigilantes you make them sitting ducks for kidnappers and bandits who are usually heavily armed to slaughter at will. So, it is not about the question of legality but of expediency and the safety of the lives and property of our people,\u201d said the Stumaje of Tungan-Maje.\n\nThe monarch said, in collaboration with the special police taskforce approved by the Zuba Divisional Police command, the vigilante groups in Tunga-Maje have drastically reduced incidences of kidnappings and banditry in recent times.\n\nIn Jikwoyi, Bassa, Anagada, Dakwa, Garam, Abuja @ 30, Pegi, Giri Kpasere, Dutse Alhaji and many others, communities armed vigilante groups with modern and dane guns, machetes, arrows, catapults, and charms, while few buoyant ones even purchase \u2018patrol cars\u2019 for their use.\n\nAlso, residents make monthly contributions ranging from N500 to N2000 per house to pay for the services of the vigilante groups. They are also supported by goodwill from individuals and certain organisations within their localities.\n\nIt\u2019s dangerous \u2013Ex-police chief\n\nHowever, a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, Wilson Inalegu, while speaking on an AIT programme, decried the development.\n\nHe said arming non-state actors with guns is dangerous to the communities and in fact represents a serious security threat to the country.\n\n\u201cYes, communities are very concerned about the growing activities of bandits and kidnappers that have traumatized the citizens. But arming vigilante groups to complement the efforts of security agencies is dangerous because it may be difficult to regulate the use of arms by the vigilantes, especially when they are not carrying legitimate functions\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are told that the federal government spent billions of naira in training police recruits and cadet officers. If indeed this huge is deployed in the training of officers, why has it not reflected in their performance? Queried a serving police officer in the Central Business District, who does not want to be named.\n\nPolice react\n\nCommenting on the development in an interview with Blueprint, spokesman of the FCT Police Command, DSP Adeh Josephine said: \u201cLet me start by noting that the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) is safe and secure. The assertion that there is growing insecurity in the FCT is wrong, misleading and capable of causing unnecessary fear and apprehension.\n\n\u201cAlso, communities are not resorting to self-help as indicated, rather, they have a new sense of awareness that security is everyone\u2019s business and the Police need every cooperation and support the citizens can provide for a safer community.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of community policing, there is nothing wrong, and of course, the law permits the people in an area to come together as groups to form alliance and partnership with the Police deployed to their communities, to inter alia, dissect security issues affecting them and also evolve collective approaches to tackle the threats.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Act 2020 is explicit on this. Vigilante group is just one nomenclature amongst the many groups of people that may decide to come together to assist the police in ensuring effective policing. These groups are not expected to work in isolation but rather under the supervision of the Police. They are also not an alternative means of protecting lives and property in the country.\u201d\n\nOn communities resorting to self-help, the police image maker said: \u201cLike I said, the communities are not resorting to self-help. The Command has since improved on its community engagement effort. We hold town hall meetings to engage community stakeholders. In the meetings, we have every strata of our communities represented, if they have lost faith in the Police, they will not attend. Also, our recent achievements in crime fighting are made possible through community support, trust and collaboration.\u201d\n\nOn the vigilantes carrying weapons, she said: \u201cWe have the firearms Act which stipulates what is permissible as regard, who should possess firearms, the kinds and for what purpose. Anyone who does otherwise contravenes the law. As part of efforts targeted at reclaiming the public space and enhancing public safety, the Command has continued to carry out mop-up of prohibited firearms in the hands of handlers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are measures in place to ensure the activities of the vigilante groups or any of such group, is within the confines of the law. For instance, the command holds stakeholders\u2019 meeting regularly where we assess the activities of these groups and resolutions are reached as regard their operations.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Babaji Sunday reassures residents of the Command\u2019s effort to ensure lives and property are well protected in the FCT as our emergency numbers are in circulation within the FCT,\u201d the command added.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN) has observed that despite the current security, economic, religious, and ethnic challenges, the collective vision of a united, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria, where righteousness abounds still abides.\n\nThis was the summation of Osinbajo\u2019s remarks at the 61st Independence Anniversary Inter-denominational church service and the 45th anniversary service of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), which held at the National Ecumenical Centre, Abuja, Sunday.\n\nThe event tagged \u2018Together, Come Let Us Build\u2019, was attended by several dignitaries, especially representatives of the National Assembly, Judiciary, and members of the Federal Executive Council including the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nThere were also eminent religious leaders, including the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor E.A Adeboye; CAN President Rev. Supo Ayokunle; among others.\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201c61 years ago, our founding fathers laid out a vision, that the many nations and ethnicities, North and South of the Niger, 300 languages or more, differing tribes, and religions, would by the grace of God become one Nation, that their diverse strengths and gifts would coalesce into a formidable economic and regional force. And that these United Nations may become the largest aggregation of black people on earth, a beacon of hope to all peoples of African descent, long bruised by the afflictions of slavery and colonial exploitation. Nigeria will be the reaffirmation of their dignity and a tonic to their spirits.\n\n\u201cThe Lord blessed the vision and prospered the land with richness in oil, in gas, in minerals of every hue. In fruit trees, in palm trees, in crops of every kind, in savannahs and forests, arable land, seas, rivers, and the riches embedded in them.\n\n\u201cThat vision of our forebears inheres in the words of our National Motto: Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress.\n\n\u201cThrough the years, we worked that vision, through thick and thin. From subjection to colonial monarchy, to a sovereign republic, to civil rule to military rule. We fought a bitter war amongst brothers that cost millions of lives, and though we still wear the deep scars of those wounds, the Lord preserved the Republic.\n\n\u201cWe have since become the most educated and most entrepreneurial nation in Africa. 10 of our 36 States have larger economies than at least 15 African countries. From our ranks, we have the most accomplished men and women, in the arts, the sciences, sports, technology, and commerce.\n\n\u201cBut today, yet again, our path has been dogged by conflict; religious and ethnic, economic challenges, insurgencies and banditry, much darkness, many valleys, and many thorns. And so many ask, \u201ccan the vision of the nation united, the nation peaceful, the nation righteous and the nation prosperous yet abide?\n\n\u201cBut the vision is not destroyed because of the many trials and tribulations, nor is the vision denied by the days when the fig tree does not blossom, or when there is no fruit on the vines; nor is the vision nullified when the labor of the olive fails, neither is the vision defeated because the flock is cut off from the fold, leaving no herd in the stalls.\n\n\u201cThe Lord God, our strength, He will yet make our feet like the feet of the deer, and we, who had been in the valley, He will make us walk on our high hills (Habakkuk 3:17-19)\n\n\u201cNeither hailstones nor hellfire can destroy the vision because the Creator of the universe is the visioner; the One who gave the vision is the Lord of dreams. And indeed even after we have suffered for a while, this God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, will perfect, establish, strengthen and settle us. (1 Peter 5:10)\n\n\u201cOur current trials cannot draw the curtains on our story, because the vision is for an appointed time. Our today is not our tomorrow because the vision is for an appointed time.\n\n\u201cThis country is greater than the sum of its parts and the sum of its mistakes, and because the God we serve is greater than the sum of our collective hopes and imagination, our nation will surmount our current travails and emerge in victory.\u201d",

A on behalf of Head Press and Public Relations Unit quoted Ogah saying that in achieving the present administration\u2019s mandate of diversifying the economy, the Ministry has among other things achieved the downstream policy which was an effort to ensure that mineral ores are not exported out of Nigeria without value addition.\n\nHe stated that the ministry has also strengthened collaboration with State Governments and relevant security agencies to ensure the security and safety of mining areas adding that incentives to improve the investment climate for mining activities have been introduced.\n\nHe said that efforts were being made to stamp out illegal mining and formalizing artisanal and small-scale mining activities across the country.\n\nThe minister also noted the ministry\u2019s collaboration with the private sector to create a large number of well-paying jobs for Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cArising from the above vision of Mr. President, the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development has initiated the following programmes/interventions:\n\nNIMEP.

We have evaluated these issues and have taken some policy actions including the new export guidelines etc to address the causes of low revenue.\n\n\u201d Streamlining of processes for efficiency and transparency: We have upgraded and automated our mineral title administration system to enable online application in processing of mineral titles and Established Six zonal offices in each geo-political zone of the country.\n\n\u201cThe downstream policy of the Ministry is an effort to ensure that mineral ores are not exported out of Nigeria without value addition,\u201d the mines Minister informed.\n\nHe added that the ministry was currently developing Artisanal and Small- Scale Mining Clusters in six Geopolitical zones: Kano for North-west, Bauchi for North-East, Kogi for North \u2013 Central, Ebonyi for South \u2013 East, Cross River for South \u2013 South and Oyo for South-West of the country so as to harness ASM mine produce and process them at the cluster centers.\n\nHe further stated that streamlining of processes for efficiency and transparency, the ministry has been able to upgraded and automate its mineral title administration system to enable online application in processing of mineral titles and has established six zonal offices in each geo-political zone of the country.",

          "text": "The sea is home to over 70 percent of the wealth of nations, hence the popular quote attributed to the English statesman, soldier, spy, writer, poet, and explorer, Mr. Walter Raleigh who opined that \u201cWhoever commands the sea, commands the trade; whoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world and consequently the world itself\u201d.\n\nIt is a fact of history that from the era of primitive communalism to the 21st century, where capitalism and socialism are still at loggerhead, the human struggle over who controls the global space economically had been between the ancient divide of the tribe of crops farmers and pastoral farmers.\n\nIt is on the premise of the foregoing strive that the incumbent C hief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral AZ Gambo at the recently concluded Chief of the Naval Staff Annual Conference 2021 in Kano posited that nations all over the world strive to ensure that vital interests critical to their survival are adequately secured.\n\nHe noted that for littoral states, the sea is of vital interest and it is critical to their existence, adding, \u201cthis is because the sea/ocean which constitutes about two-thirds of the earth\u2019s surface area holds immense resources that are continuously being exploited\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe sea has remained a medium of global trade as both littoral and land-linked countries depend on it for easier and cheaper haulage and inter-connectivity with other states. The global economy depends largely on the ocean, with the ocean-based economic sector estimated at between $3-6 Trillion with more than 3 billion people relying on the oceans for their livelihood (UNCTAD, 2016). The strategic value attached to the sea and resources therein usually heightens the exposure of littoral nations to maritime security breaches.\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure that the Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) are secured and maritime resources protected, most littoral states establish maritime forces such as navies, coast guard and marine police amongst others. These Maritime Law Enforcement Agencies (MLEA) help to prevent illegalities capable of hampering economic activities thereby promoting national development. National development involves an integrated process of building capacity in all the sectors in the nation, aimed at enhancing the well-being of the citizens. In the contemporary state system, development integrates the protection of core values as well as protecting and harnessing resources for the wellbeing of the people. Hence, littoral states integrate their maritime resource protection and maritime security efforts for effective policing of the maritime domain towards rapid national development\u201d.\n\nDrawing inference from credible and verifiable global data the CNS said, \u201cIn India, aside the primary role of safeguarding the vast India coastline of about 4,046 nautical miles against external aggression, the Indian Navy also safeguards the country\u2019s energy security, as bulk of its oil supplies transit through the Indian Ocean which in recent years has witnessed a surge in the incidences of piracy (Susheel M, 2020). In addition, the Indian Navy contributes to national development through its indigenous ship building effort which in turn creates an ecosystem of smaller industrial enterprises. For instance, Project 17A frigates (Building of 7 Frigates) is expected to employ a workforce of about 4,500 workers annually within the yard and nearly 28,000 personnel per year as outsourced manpower from ancillary industries (Singh, 2019). This effort spurs economic growth and engenders industrialization in India. Similarly, South Africa has a coastline of about 1,619 nautical miles ( www.gov.za ). It is endowed with a lot of mineral resources and several aquatic mammals that attract tourists and generate substantial revenue. The protection of these resources by the South African Navy has improved economic growth of the country and enhanced national development especially in the fishing industry.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a maritime nation with a vast coastline and a maritime domain that is endowed with hydrocarbons and other resources. The sea is the lifeblood of Nigeria\u2019s economy, essentially, it serves as a medium for conveying the vast majority of her trade and many vital resources such as oil.\n\nIncidentally, the sea is also being exploited by criminals and economic saboteurs thus inhibiting national development. Like most navies all over the world, the Nigerian Navy (NN) was established in 1956 to guarantee freedom of the seas in territorial and international waters under Nigeria\u2019s maritime jurisdiction and influence. This maritime aspiration translates to peacetime and wartime roles with national security and national development implications. The NN also performs some non-military roles that invariably contribute to socio-economic activities and enhance national development\u201d.\n\nHe said that the purpose of his paper was to create the desired awareness about the roles and efforts of the NN towards national development in Nigeria, noting, \u201cI am motivated by the fact that this intellectual engagement would empower this Distinguished Audience to be able to contribute to the NN\u2019s efforts for enhance national development. Saying that the paper will conceptualise the key variables, and highlight the history, roles and structure of the NN\u201d.\n\nThe CNS said that the overview of NN\u2019s Geo-strategic maritime environment would be discussed before enumerating the threats to Nigeria\u2019s maritime security and its implications on national development.\n\nThe paper he averred will consider the roles of the NN towards national development as well as the challenges of the NN towards enhancing national development, stressing that the presentation will proffer some policy options towards enhancing national development.\n\nVice Admiral Gambo said that the aim of his paper is to highlight the roles of the NN towards national development in Nigeria.\n\nWhat then is national development? National Development according to Ball is to reduce poverty and ensure adequate standard of living for all members of the society\u201d (Ball, 1988).\n\nAs he expounded, this involves meeting basic material needs such as food, housing, education, health and medical care, as well as certain non-material requirements such as the ability to participate in economic and political decisions affecting the course of one\u2019s life.\n\nFor Amucheazi (1980), \u201cdevelopment is realistically seen as a multi-dimensional process involving the totality of man in his political, economic, psychological and social realties among others\u201d. Development is a holistic phenomenon not a concept to be abridged in application or compartmentalized and approached as a uni-dimensional process. Essentially, it should be man-oriented and not institutional-oriented\u201d.\n\nHe further posited that \u201cif we focus our attention on the individual citizens we can then think of what he needs at a particular time; thus it means that national development has to be people-oriented with its focus on safeguarding human dignity\u201d.\n\nTo this end the implications of maritime security threats to national development in Nigeria was considered under accrued revenue, economic inflation, marine environment and proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).\n\nAccording the CNS, \u201cOne of the implications of maritime security threats on national development is loss of revenue as a result of crude oil theft and other ancillary crimes. Illegal bunkering and crude oil theft are capable of denying the nation of the much-needed revenue from refined petroleum product marketing and crude oil lifting.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the 2016 Budget which was aptly titled \u201cBudget of Change\u201d provided for aggregate expenditures of \u20a66.06 trillion and planned to be largely funded by revenue from crude oil. However, crude oil theft and other related illegal petroleum activities created a loss of revenue resulting in a deficit of \u20a62.2trillion that year. In recent years, the NN has been able to effectively reduce crude oil theft and other related vices through the implementation of various strategies which has resulted in more funds accruing to the Federal Government for socio economic development of our nation. Evidently, on 8 Aug 21, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR) for the month of April 2021 stated that its revenue for the month of April when compared to March 2021 increased by 17.73 per cent.\n\n\u201cEconomic Inflation. The persistent threats of piracy and sea robbery has been responsible for increase in shipping charges and attendant increase in cost of imported goods as well as loss of profit from exported goods. Notably, this is a direct implication of the imposition of high tariffs and insurance premium on vessels involved in freighting and conveying Gulf of Guinea cargoes. The cumulative effect of high cost of goods with low purchasing power leads to economic inflation and negative development\u201d.\n\nThe Naval Chief however, identified that the marine environment in the Niger Delta is characterised by activities which affects the environment.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the operations of illegal refineries have severely impacted biodiversity, aesthetic scenery of the forest, regeneration of plant species and destruction of wildlife habitat as well as disruption of water cycle and loss of medicinal plant species. The resulting oil spills from vandalised pipes and wastes from thousands of makeshift refineries combine to degrade the environment causing land, sea and air pollution thereby impinging on public health. It also costs the government and other multinational companies billions of Naira that could have been used for other developmental projects to clean the spillage thereby depriving government of these resources for national development. The operation of illegal refineries has generated black soot and acid rain in some states in the Niger Delta, including health hazards such as asthma and skin rashes. However, the situation has greatly improved through concerted efforts taken to effectively curtail the operations of the illegal refineries. Recent report by NNPC indicates that there was a 34.29 per cent reduction in the number of pipeline points vandalised from 70 in March 2021 to 46 in April 2021,\u201d the Navy Chief said.\n\nWhile winding up his presentation, Vice Admiral Gambo said the strategic relevance of the nation\u2019s maritime environment and the role it plays in national development and prosperity of the nation has been proven over the years.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe environment is however prone to diverse contemporary threats which portend dangers to the nation\u2019s wellbeing and security if not curbed. Hence, the NN has made efforts to counter these threats through the maintenance of credible and effective presence within our maritime area to ensure a secured and conducive domain for enhanced national development.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy to note that despite a harsh fiscal environment, the Federal Government has remained committed to enhancing the response capability of the NN through the acquisition of more patrol vessels and aircraft. Permit me to reiterate that the NN is proactive towards guaranteeing that the Nation\u2019s maritime environment is safe and open to legitimate activities through the emplacement of appropriate strategies.\n\n\u201cAs we strive to forge and leave a legacy of a formidable Navy that would continue to serve Nigeria\u2019s interest, we are united in vision and purpose and we will not be deterred by challenges\u201d.\n\nThis resolve he noted is anchored on the fact that the Nation\u2019s maritime domain will continue to be of strategic importance due to its inherent resources and use for global trading activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the CNS reiterated the wisdom inherent in the words of one of the foremost American founding father, George Washington, who said that, \u201cWithout a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it everything honourable and glorious\u201d.",

We\u2019ve got to keep our feet on the ground, keep our heads down and work because there is a very, very long way to go.\u201d\n\nNext weekend Napoli travel to Fiorentina in what will be the first true test of their title credentials, as their 2-1 win over Juventus earlier this month came against a team missing a host of starters.\n\nThey made easy work of a passive Cagliari, with Osimhen making it four Serie A goals in five appearances this campaign in the 11th minute when he met Piotr Zielinski\u2019s low cross with a typically assured finish.\n\nOsimhen was involved again when a low-key match was settled in the 57th minute, the in-form Nigeria attacker being cleaned out by Diego Godin and Insigne lashing home the subsequent penalty to ensure a simple win.\n\nThe Nigerian had scored a brace as Napoli outclassed Sampdoria 4-0 in a Serie A game on Thursday evening.\n\nREAD ALSO: Football Must Do More To Combat Racism Than The Take Knee \u2013 Lukaku\n\nJuventus Win First Serie A Game Since Ronaldo\u2019s Departure\n\nLazio Win Derby Honours\n\nGoals from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Pedro and Felipe Anderson gave Lazio a tight derby win over Roma at a raucous Stadio Olimpico which saw two teams attack each other for 90 minutes.\n\nMaurizio Sarri\u2019s side were winless in three league matches heading into the weekend but now sit sixth on 11 points, seven behind Napoli and just one behind fourth-placed Roma, who twice pulled goals back through Roger Ibanez and Jordan Veretout.\n\nIn the aftermath Mourinho lashed out at referee Marco Guida and the VAR officials after what he saw as a clear foul on Nicolo Zaniolo just before Lazio launched the counter-attack which ended with former Roma player Pedro putting Lazio 2-0 ahead in the 19th minute.\n\n\u201cThe referee and VAR weren\u2019t up to the standards of a match of this level. From 2-0 it could have been 1-1, the referee made a mistake on the field and VAR made a mistake\u2026 they all made a mistake,\u201d Mourinho said to DAZN.\n\nDybala Misses Chelsea\n\nJuventus will have to face Chelsea in the Champions League without Paulo Dybala after the Argentina forward limped off with a thigh injury early in their 3-2 win over Sampdoria.\n\nDybala opened the scoring with nine minutes on the clock at a wet Allianz Stadium, with Leonardo Bonucci and Manuel Locatelli netting the other goals to move Juve ninth on eight points, but soon afterwards the 27-year-old left the field in tears after the latest in a long line of injuries.\n\nMassimiliano Allegri\u2019s side host European champions Chelsea on Wednesday and the coach said Dybala and centre-forward Alvaro Morata, who also exited with a thigh problem towards the end of the match, would be out of action until after the next international break which runs from after next weekend\u2019s matches to October 15.\n\nFiorentina bounced back from midweek defeat to Inter Milan with a battling 1-0 win at Udinese which moved them into fifth on 12 points, six behind Napoli.\n\nPromoted Empoli are threatening the European places after beating Bologna 4-2 to win their second match on the bounce and climb up to eighth, while Salernitana remain rooted to the bottom of the league with a single point after losing 1-0 at Sassuolo.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to make public the names of those indicted in the alleged misappropriation of over N6 trillion funds for the Niger Delta Development Commission\u2019s operations (NDDC).\n\nIt will be recalled that the NDDC\u2019s recent Forensic Audit Report implicated several of the commission\u2019s executives for misappropriating funds between the years 2000 and 2019.\n\nThe organisation encouraged the president to order Malami and the proper anti-corruption agencies to bring anyone suspected of being responsible for the missing N6 trillion to justice as soon as possible, as well as to fully retrieve any misused public funds.\n\nIn an open letter dated September 25, 2021, written by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation emphasized the importance of publishing the identities of individuals accused in the report as soon as possible, in the public interest, and ensuring that they are prosecuted if required.\n\nThe initiatives, according to SERAP, would enhance the victims\u2019 right to restitution and compensation, as well as ensure non-recurrence and boost public confidence in the battle against corruption.\n\nAlso, the organisation argued that using the audit report to genuinely combat the corruption epidemic in the NDDC and rein in those indicted would alleviate poverty, improve access of Nigerians to basic public goods and services, and enhance the ability of the government to meet its human rights and anti-corruption obligations.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cDespite the country\u2019s enormous oil wealth, ordinary Nigerians have derived very little benefit from trillions of naira budgeted for socio-economic development in the region primarily because of widespread grand corruption, and the entrenched culture of impunity of perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe level of grand corruption in the NDDC and the devastating effects on poor Nigerians are serious enough to meet the requirements of crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe public interest in publishing the names of those indicted by the audit report outweighs any considerations to withhold the information, as there would be no prejudice against those whose names are published as long as the information is appropriately framed and truthful.\n\n\u201cThe audit report raises prima facie evidence of grand corruption and its staggering effects in the Niger Delta. Nigerians have the right to know the names of those indicted and other details in the report, as guaranteed under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the letter stated, \u201cPublishing widely the report and the names of those indicted would remove the possibility of obstruction of justice, and provide insights relevant to the public debate on the ongoing efforts to combat grand corruption and the longstanding impunity of perpetrators in the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians are entitled to the right to receive information without any interference or distortion, and the enjoyment of this right should be based on the principle of maximum disclosure, and a presumption that all information is accessible subject only to a narrow system of exceptions.\n\n\u201cAccording to public interest test, even if the government demonstrates that the publication of the names of public officials would substantially harm a legitimate interest, it is nevertheless obliged to disclose the requested information if, as it is the case here, the public interest in disclosure is sufficient enough to overweigh any perceived harm.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the Incorporated Trustees of SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\n\n\u201cMisappropriation of public funds meant to ensure access to basic public goods and services rises to the level of crimes against humanity, as this has forced millions of Nigerians in the region to live in inhumane or degrading conditions, in violation of the Rome Statute.\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, the Forensic Audit Report into the activities of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) reveals grim allegations of misappropriation of N6 trillion in the commission between 2000 and 2019, and that there are over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr. Malami; Professor Bolaji Owasanoye SAN, Chairman Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC); Abdulrasheed Bawa, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).",

          "title": "Nigeria: All Governors Have Resolved to Dump Open Grazing, Governors\u2019 Chairman Fayemi Says",
          "text": "The Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi on Sunday disclosed that all governors in the country have in principle agreed that open grazing was outdated and there was need to embrace modern livestock management approaches.\n\nHe said while speaking on \u2018THISDAYLIVE\u2019 a programme monitored on Arise News Channel.\n\nHis remark was in the light of the feud generated by the comments of Governors of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu and his Kaduna counterpart, Malam Nasir El- Rufai, following the anti-open grazing laws being adopted in most southern states.\n\nFayemi said the governors have also subscribed to the national livestock transformation plan via the National Economic Council decision that was taken during a meeting chaired by the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\u201cAny time there is an altercation between any of my colleagues, it is something that I feel wholly uncomfortable about because it takes us away from the substance, in this case on open grazing.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that we have taken a position as the NGF and both sides of the divide are correct. On the one hand, we have all agreed at the level of the NGF that open grazing is outdated and we need to look for alternative modern livestock management approaches,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nHe averred that there was need to balance the position of the southern governors on anti-open grazing legislation with that of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum by giving support to all states that have subscribed to the National Livestock Transformation Plan through funding from federal government agencies like NARSAL in same way the Central Bank of Nigeria provided support to rice farmers through funding.\n\n\u201cAnd that this could take the form of support to those who want to engage in ranching in the north and in the south. And that is why I said both sides are correct in the sense that Nasir El- Rufai of Kaduna State is talking about ranching as alternative way of stopping unrestrained open grazing and catering to the need of those who embark on open grazing approaches. And the southern governors are opposed to that.\n\n\u201cAll they are saying is pending the time you are able to do that, there should also be a disincentive by way of law in ensuring those who take advantage of the activities of herders, particularly non-violent herders and those who resort to violent crimes, need to be punished.\n\n\u201cBut in addressing criminality, we must also address causes of criminality, which I guess is what el-Rufai is talking about,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nCommenting on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), Fayemi said it would be wrong to assume that the proposed amendments ignored the concerns of the states.\n\nHe some of the observations which they sent to the President have been forwarded to the implementation committee chaired by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva while discussion is already on-going.\n\nFayemi noted that some of the issues they raised related to ownership structure. According to him, the governors were of the opinion that the Ministry of Finance incorporated and the Ministry of Petroleum Resources should be the sole owner of the company that emerged out of the PIA.\n\n\u201cWe have suggested that the only body that belongs to both the federal, state and the local governments is the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) in which we are shareholders.\n\n\u201cAnd if it is held in trust by the NSIA, then we are all more comfortable in seeing that Act as a federation company rather than a federal government company. And that is one.\n\n\u201cThe second concern we have expressed relates to the depletion of the federal government account by the various percentages that have been earmarked for frontier states and host communities of the petroleum products. \u201cAnd without prejudices to what the host communities deserve, we don\u2019t have any problem with the host communities benefiting from this, which as a matter of fact we feel should be five per cent.\n\n\u201cWe think that this necessarily should not lead to a depletion of the federation account or whatever is due to the fed account as a result of this,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the third concern which the governors had consistently raised and which they hope the signing of the PIA would help them address was petroleum subsidy and its continued use to deplete the Federation account.",

          "text": "Hundreds of protesters have rallied in Tunisia\u2019s capital to protest against President Kais Saied\u2019s move to seize governing powers.\n\nDemonstrators gathered on Sunday in the centre of Tunis along Habib Bourguiba Avenue under a heavy police presence to demand his resignation, chanting, \u201cThe people want the fall of the coup.\u201d\n\nBrushing aside much of the 2014 constitution, Saied gave himself the power to rule by decree on Wednesday, two months after sacking the prime minister, suspending parliament, and assuming executive authority.\n\nAbout 2,000 people attended the rally in front of the iconic National Theatre, historically home to all the major demonstrations in Tunis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really angry,\u201d said Soumaya Werhani, a 30-year-old student amid the roar of the crowd and the sweltering heat. \u201cWe are demonstrating to denounce the president\u2019s decisions to stop the constitution and his coup against state institutions.\u201d\n\nAbout 20 global and Tunisian human rights groups issued a statement on Saturday condemning the move as a \u201cpower grab\u201d.\n\nThe signatories argued the decree, which strengthens the powers of the president\u2019s office at the expense of those of the prime minister and parliament, is \u201cimplicitly abrogating the constitutional order in \u2026 a first step towards authoritarianism\u201d.\n\nBelgassen Bounara waved a copy of the 2014 constitution that Saied plans to rewrite. He came from Tataouine, in southern Tunisia, a poor region forgotten by the state.\n\nThe computer salesman said he came to demonstrate because \u201cSaied wants to get rid of the constitution and our democracy. He is taking us back into dictatorship,\u201d Bounara told Al Jazeera.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest was the second since Saied dismissed the government and suspended parliament on July 25.\n\nHowever, Saied\u2019s move has the consensus of large swaths of the population, who see his actions as necessary to address a crisis of political paralysis, economic stagnation and a poor response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn the other side of the street, a small but vocal group of Saied supporters chanted, \u201cKais Saied is good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decree is nothing important, the Tunisian people want a clean, honest president who doesn\u2019t steal from the people,\u201d artist Mohamed Khaled told Al Jazeera. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful. People just want to fill their shopping bag and eat.\u201d\n\nCherif El Kadhi, a former parliamentary officer, told Al Jazeera the demonstrations were a sign that Saied\u2019s actions are loathed as much as they are accepted.\n\n\u201cThese protests I think will continue to gain momentum depending on the economic situation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear Tunisians are fed up with the political elite 10 years after the revolution,\u201d which is why they have put their trust in Saied, a former law professor, he added.\n\nHowever, discontent could lead to more protests in the coming weeks and months, he said.\n\nTunisia\u2019s largest political party, the moderate Islamist Ennahdha, decried Saied\u2019s moves as \u201ca flagrant coup against democratic legitimacy\u201d, and called for people to unite and defend democracy in \u201ca tireless peaceful struggle\u201d.\n\nEnnahdha is itself grappling with internal dissent after 113 senior party members announced their resignation on Saturday. They blamed the head of the party, Rachid Ghannouchi, and his entourage for failing to form a united front to oppose Saied and confront the country\u2019s political crisis.",

          "text": "Another batch of 10 of the remaining 21 abducted students of the Bethel Baptist High School, Damishi, Kaduna, has been released by bandits after 81 days in captivity.\n\nChairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, said the 10 students were released on Sunday afternoon and were reunited with their parents.\n\nHowever, while giving an update on the Bethel students kidnap debacle, Hayab expressed hope that the remaining 11 students would soon be released.\n\n\u201cTen more students of Baptist High School were released this afternoon. We have 11 now with bandits. Thanking all Nigerians for their prayers and support. Trusting God that the rest will be released very soon,\u201d Hayab said in a WhatsApp message to THISDAY.\n\nOn July 5, bandits invaded the school located about six kilometers away from Kaduna metropolis and abducted 121 students. The students have since been released in batches by the bandits.\n\nSo far, four batches of students, totaling 110 had been released, including those, who escaped from captivity.\n\nParents of the students were said to have paid a total of over N200 million as ransom to the bandits.\n\nThe bandits were said to have demanded and collected fresh ransom for each batch of students released.\n\nThree suspects arrested in connection with the abduction of the students were recently paraded by the Force Headquarters of the Nigerian police in Abuja.\n\nOn the the recent killing of some soldiers by insurgents in Marte-Dikwa, Borno, Ndume implored the military not to be deterred by the incident, which reportedly claimed the lives of no fewer than 15 soldiers.\n\nNdume, who is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, in a release on Sunday, called on the troops in war theatre area of Borno State not to allow their morale to be dampened.\n\nAccording to him, what happened is not enough to low the spirit of the soldiers but urged them to continue in the fight against insurgency and ending the menace in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe killing of the soldiers between Marte and Dikwa in Borno State is highly condemnable, it is sad and unfortunate. This should not discourage the troops and the Army from taking the war to the Insurgents. We send our condolences to the family of those killed and pray that God grant them eternal rest especially, as they died in the course of serving their father land.\u201d\n\nNdume added that as a nation, the people must continue to encourage and pray for the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouk Yahaya, along with the military hierarchy and officers and men for the good work they have been doing to end the Boko Haram insurgency attacks.\n\nThe ranking Senator also called on the federal government to adequately fund the military so that the officers and men could perform optimally.\n\nLast Friday, dozens of military troops on pass and on their way to Maiduguri, Borno State capital, were ambushed by suspected members of Boko Haram linked to ISWAP, killing several of them.\n\nThe incident reportedly took place between Marte-Dikwa council areas, when the insurgents fired rocket launchers at military trucks, which culminated into sporadic shootings targeting troops being conveyed from Marte to Maiduguri, after spending some time at the theatre.\n\nMarte, about 180km north of Maiduguri, remains one of the council areas of Borno not fully occupied by civilian population, as most of its people have been displaced and taking refuge in Monguno, and some parts of Maiduguri.",

          "text": "The official website of the upcoming Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) digital currency, the eNaira, has gone live, exactly one week to the planned launch of the initiative.\n\nRemarkably, 24-hours after the website went live, it has recorded over one million hits, according to analytics monitored by THISDAY.\n\nThe development shows a reflection of the level of interest in the proposed digital currency.\n\nThe website promises easier financial transactions for users of eNaira, offers opportunity for peer-to-peer payments which allows users to send money to one another through a linked bank account or card; allows customers to move money from their bank account to their eNaira wallet with ease; can monitor their eNaira wallet, check balances and view transaction history; and make in-store payment using their eNaira wallet by scanning QR codes.\n\nIn addition, customers are allowed to scan the QR Code on the website to get started.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, while speaking to a gathering of foreign investors in New York, recently, had told his audience that because of activities surrounding the country\u2019s Independence celebration on October 1, the earlier planned launch of the eNaira on same date would likely be rescheduled to October 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe central bank would not want the event to take the shine away from the Independence celebration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency. It is a novel idea because we think it will facilitate trade, Nigeria being the biggest economy in Africa, this will set the tone to tell Africa that we are ready to lead and we would indeed lead in trade and we would make sure that happens.\n\n\u201cBetween all central bankers in ECOWAS, we are already working on certain collaboration to make trade, payment and banking system integrate in such a way to set example on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),\u201d he added.\n\nIn line with global trend, the CBN recently took a major step towards the launch of its digital currency with its formal announcement of its engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc. as its technical partner for the project. To choose the technical partner, the CBN went through a rigorous vendor selection process in line with the Public Procurement Act, conducted by seven departmental directors and a Deputy Governor whereby several companies were evaluated. The evaluation was based on the following criteria: technology ownership and control; implementation timeline; efficiency, ease of adoption; support for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT); platform security; interoperability; implementation experience.\n\nEmefiele expressed optimism that the eNaira, would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow. He said the digital money would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nAccording to him, after its unveiling, Nigerians should be able to download the eNaira app from either Google plays store or Apple app store, on board themselves and fund their eNaira wallet using their bank account or with cash at a registered agent location.\n\n\u201cIf you are a bank customer and you have say N10 million in your bank account, for your comfort of spending and making purchase, you can tell the bank to load N2 million out of your N10 million into your wallet.\n\n\u201cSo, your bank balance in physical cash drops to N8 million, while your e-wallet carries N2 million. With that you can make purchases both within and across the country.\n\n\u201cThere are so many variance of the eNaira. But this is where we would start because we are not going to pretend that there are not risks in opening your system up. We would look at the various products, determine the risk, determine the best way to mitigate the risk before we now open it up more and more,\u201d Emefiele added.\n\nAlso shedding more light on Bitts, he said, \u201cwe chose them as a partner. In some other climes where they are, they have their software and they earn their money. But we chose that they would establish their company in Nigeria. \u201cThe CBN will own substantially stake in that company. It is a company that will be established in Nigeria and majority holding will be the CBN,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the CBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained that the eNaira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017, to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s central bank last weekend announced that all transactions of crypto-currencies are illegal, effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cVirtual currency-related business activities are illegal financial activities,\u201d the BBC quoted People\u2019s Bank of China to have said, warning it \u201cseriously endangers the safety of people\u2019s assets\u201d. China is one of the world\u2019s largest crypto-currency markets. Fluctuations there often impact the global price of crypto-currencies.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin fell by more than $2,000 (\u00a31,460) in the wake of the Chinese announcement.\n\nIt was the latest in China\u2019s national crackdown on what it sees as a volatile, speculative investment at best \u2013 and a way to launder money at worst. Trading crypto-currency had officially been banned in China since 2019, but had continued online through foreign exchanges. However, there has been a significant crackdown this year.\n\nIn May, Chinese state intuitions warned buyers they would have no protection for continuing to trade Bitcoin and other currencies online, as government officials vowed to increase pressure on the industry.\n\nIn June, it told banks and payment platforms to stop facilitating transactions and issued bans on \u201cmining\u201d the currencies \u2013 the trade of using powerful computers to make new coins.\n\nObinna Chima",
