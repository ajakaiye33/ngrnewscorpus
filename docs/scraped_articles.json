Extraordinary rendition, or any other transfer, without due process is prohibited\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that Kanu travelled to Kenya on his British passport and was duly admitted as such and as a free man.\n\n\u201cFurther, no valid territorial jurisdiction can issue from an act of extraordinary rendition because Kanu is, technically speaking, still in Kenya. The Nigerian bench warrant standing against Kanu is, in the absence of any successful extradition proceedings in Kenya, invalid to arrest in Kenya.\n\nEjimakor said that he also requested the Commission to adopt other urgent measures as the Commission deems fit in the circumstances to protect Nnamdi Kanu in the interim, adding that a fact-finding visitation to Nigeria is also in reckoning.\n\n\u201cIn my previous press briefings, I had said \u2013 with much confidence \u2013 that Kanu\u2019s trial will be a trial within trial. To those who didn\u2019t fully grasp what it meant, this extant continental legal action will give you a clue. And this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, any nation that dabbles in extraordinary rendition has unwittingly brought impediments to her territorial jurisdiction. So, Nigeria, whether it admits it or not, has triggered a hornets nest that has, for the first time, brought the international legal order to bear on the matter of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\nKwara Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has approved the implementation of promotion arrears for tens of thousands of teachers and staff of the State Universal Basic Education Board (KWSUBEB), effectively ending years of career stagnation that brought workers\u2019 morale to an all-time low.\n\nThis was announced by SUBEB chairman Prof Shehu Raheem Adaramaja at the commissioning of operational vehicles, motorcycles, electronic gadgets, and instructional materials for basic schools, triggered widespread applause from teachers and other workers of SUBEB who hailed the decision as timely and fitting for the administration\u2019s record of hearkening to the yearnings of the people.\n\nPublic basic school teachers in Kwara State were last promoted in 2017.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cConduct of years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 promotion examination and oral interview has been expressly approved by His Excellency to hold between the 2nd and 5th August, 2021,\u201d Adaramaja said.\n\n\u201cOutstanding salary arrears of staff is also not left out as the process is at its peak. We say a big thank you to His Excellency for considering the plight of our staff and finding a solution to the agitation of our staff.\u201d\n\nAbdulRazaq, who was represented by Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi, said the administration has unlocked the goldmine of opportunities to revitalise basic education in the state with the renewed relationship with the Universal Basic Education Commission \u2013 after seven years of an official blacklist of Kwara.\n\n\u201cExcept for the 12-seater bus which has been donated to us by Unity Bank Plc all these facilities are some of the gains of our renewed relationship with the Universal Basic Education Commission,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdulRazaq also acknowledged the prudent management of scarce resources by the leadership of KWSUBEB, leading to the procurement of 1,500 cartoons of white chalks from Kwara State College of Education ( Technical), Lafiagi.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is that these facilities are what Kwara should have been enjoying if the last administration had played its own roles. It is a confirmation of our position that the last administration opted to kill basic education in the state. Our efforts have been to restore quality, dignity, and citizens\u2019 confidence to public basic education in the state,\u201d the Governor said.\n\n\u201cThese tools will not only improve the standard of basic education in the state, they will also provide an enabling environment for adequate monitoring and supervision of teaching and learning activities across our schools. These new infrastructures will complement the ongoing renovation and remodelling of classrooms across over 600 schools in the state.\n\n\u201cWhen you add that to the recent recruitment of 4,701 teachers through a process that was the best of its kind in the recent history of Kwara State, you will see that our vision is comprehensive and clear. On August 5, we will bring stakeholders together to a summit to evolve a holistic strategy for the future of our education sector.\u201d\n\nAbdulRazaq applauded the Unity Bank PLC for the donation of 12-seater Hyundai bus and the UBEC management for their support to the State Government and Kwara SUBEB in providing the materials/equipments needed in the schools.\n\nPermanent Secretary of the Ministry ofEducation Mrs Adeoshun Mary Kemi applauded the Governor for his giant strides in the education sector.\n\n\u201cYou cannot appreciate the magnitude of the contributions of this administration without being reminded of the pathetic situation of the education sector before the advent of the Otoge mantra. The previous administrations left educational system to a near collapse.

It is a good news to us, coming at a very good time. I believe everyone hearing this will appreciate the Governor for being so good to us. We want to appreciate him in all respects, particularly on this promotion exercise so pronounced,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of this is that these promotion exercises (2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020), going by the good understanding we have with the government, will come with cashbacking.\n\n\u201cI can say that this administration from inception brought permanent end to salaries being paid on percentages. On the account of salaries being paid on percentages, we have salaries arrears of about three months and 43%. We want to plead with His Excellency to further look at our direction and clear the outstanding salaries arrears of about three months and 43%.\u201d\n\nThe items commissioned are: 1 (nos) of 18 p-seater hummer bus for Quality Assurance Department; 5 (nos) of 2020 Model Hilux Van for project monitoring; 45 Bajaj boxers motorcycles for schools supervision; 40 (nos) of Samsung galaxy tab A for e-quality assurance for the Quality Assurance Officers; 10 sets of computer system for project monitoring; 20 digital calipers for project unit; 1 projector for Quality Assurance Department; and instructional materials for schools and library books and shelves for basic schools to encourage reading culture.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, asked for an amendment to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to enable it regulate the use of the Internet by private broadcasting stations as well as other online broadcast media.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Lai Mohammed, said the government has a duty to monitor all broadcast contents in the country.\n\nMohammed spoke at a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values on a bill seeking to amend the NBC Act.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in the media industry kicked against the proposal which came barely a week after the NBC had asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nGovernment moved to license social media companies after Twitter took down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, after stating that the message violated its policy.\n\nIn the tweet, the president had threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe bill sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, Segun Odebumni and two others is seeking an amendment for the NBC Act.\n\nSection 2c of the proposed amendment listed the categories of licenses to be granted which include Cable Television Services, Direct Satellite broadcast, Direct to Home, IPTV, Radio, EPG and Digital Terrestrial television; radio and television stations owned, established or operated by the federal, state and local governments, broadcast signal distribution, Online broadcast, community broadcasting, public service broadcasting, among others.\n\nThe Information Minister said: \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have responsibility to monitor content, including Twitter.\u201d\n\nOn a proposal that the NBC should regulate and provide digital broadcasting in Nigeria in line with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) agreement 2006, he said the laws of the country cannot be subservient to any treaty\n\n\u201cWith due respect, our laws cannot be subservient to international telecommunication union treaties. It is true that we are part of the treaty, but our laws and act cannot be made subservient to any treaty. Treaties re made, but our laws will have to protect peculiar situations in our country. So, will suggest we take another look at this.\u201d\n\nBut the Institute for Media and Society (IMS), International Press Centre (IPC) and Centre for Media Law and Advocacy (CMLA) faulted the proposal.\n\nThey argued that inclusion of internet broadcast and online media to the category of broadcast service licenses to be issued by the NBC will be injurious to freedom of expression and press freedom.\n\nThe CSOs, in a memorandum submitted to the committee, also kicked against a proposal to empower the NBC to fix price for Pay-TV in the proposed amendment.\n\nExecutive Director of IPC, Mr. Lanre Arogundade said fixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing, which could discourage investment in the sector.\n\nArogundade argued that the conduct of NBC over time presented it as an extension of the office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\n\u201cFixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing that has the potential of discouraging investment in the sector and the attendant job losses. Giving the NBC the sole right over tariff issues which cannot be interfered with could be interpreted as an ouster clause that arrogates to it arbitrary powers that cannot be challenged even in the court of law.\u201d\n\nIn his intervention, Akin Akingbulu, executive director, IMS said the commission should not receive directives from the minister.\n\n\u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section six should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector,\u201d he said.\n\nIn their joint submission, IPC and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy said the appointment of the NBC board should be subject to the confirmation of the national assembly.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of the NBC has over time presented it as an extension of the minister of information and culture which rarely acts independently,\u201d they said.\n\nOnly recently, NBC had asked all social media platforms and online broadcasting service providers to apply for broadcast licence.\n\nIts Director General, Armstrong Idachaba, gave the directive in a newspaper advertorial following Federal Government\u2019s announcement that Twitter and other social media platforms must register as a Nigerian company for them to do business in Nigeria.\n\nIdachaba said in the advertorial that the NBC establishment code empowers the commission to ask the companies to be licensed.",

The actor was limping and visibly shaking \u2013 an appearance which suggested a bad health condition.\n\nThe court clerk read out five count charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a Child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault-which contravenes sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.\n\nThe actor pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.\n\nWhile in the dock, Baba Ijesha showed signs of discomfort as he kept bending intermittently. The concerned magistrate, noticing the stress of the defendant, asked if he was fine.\n\n\u201cAre you okay? Do you want to sit down?

He was said to have attempted to run away from the hoodlums but could not, as they had him surrounded.\n\nThe lawmaker, who confirmed the incident, expressed shock and said he was still in disbelief on why he was attacked.\n\n\u201cMy security man was not just killed, but was beheaded. I call on security operatives to strengthen security in Orsu LGA and ensure that lives and property are protected,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a related development, the lawmaker also confirmed an attack on the country home of immediate past Attorney General of the state, Cyprian Akaolisa, in the same council area the same day.\n\nHe said the gunmen first attacked the erstwhile Commissioner for Justice before heading to his own home.\n\nHe confirmed that the houses were burnt, but no lives were lost except his guard who was beheaded.\n\nSimilarly, Daily Sun gathered that the gunmen also beheaded an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in the area, Jonathan Ugochukwu.\n\nVillage sources, also, revealed that the house and vehicle of the councillor representing Amaebu Ebenatu ward, Clifford Mazi, was not spared by the gunmen as they set it on fire, fortunately, he was said not to be around when the hoodlums stormed his home.\n\nAlso, the gunmen razed the house of the President General of Amaebu Ebenatu, Oliver Ejelonu, who was said to have narrowly escaped before they invaded his house.\n\nWife of the APC chieftain, Mrs Nkechi Ugochukwu, disclosed that the gunmen carried her husband outside and beheaded him before torching their house.\n\nMrs Ugochukwu said that the gunmen went away with her husband\u2019s head. A community source also revealed that the rampaging gunmen also left with the head of the lawmaker\u2019s guard.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe hoodlums did not meet the lawmaker and, in anger, they beheaded his gate man and left with his head.\n\n\u201cThey also invaded the house of another APC chieftain here, Jonathan Ugochukwu, burnt his house, beheaded him and left with his head. They also burnt the houses of the president general and the councillor representing our ward.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the former Attorney General, Akaolisa, said that he had reported the incident to the police. The state Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, said the police were already investigating the multiple incidents and noted that his men were closing in on the perpetrators.",

B. Abubakar, informed the court that the case is for hearing and although the defendant has not yet been produced by the DSS, they are ready to proceed.\n\nHe however requested the mind of the court to proceed without a fiat taking into consideration that the court has commenced vacation and Justice Binta Nyako was not one of the vacation judges.\n\nReacting, Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Mr ifeanyi Ejiofor, informed the court of an application he filed seeking the transfer of Kanu from DSS custody to a correctional centre.\n\nResponding, the trial judge held that the trial of Kanu cannot proceed in the absence of Kanu, having been arrested and brought into the country. The judge insisted that Kanu must physically be brought to court since he is now available to face his trial.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Nyako ordered that access be given to Kanu\u2019s lawyer to see the defendant.\n\nThe court also ordered that the prosecution must produce Kanu in court at the next adjourned date of October 21.\n\nJustice Nyako however stated that if the prosecution is able to get a fiat from the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, the court can reschedule the date for next hearing.\n\nDetails later\u2026\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Access Bank leads with N11.929 trillion, followed by Zenith Bank\u2019s N11.297 trillion\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe five tier-1 banks in Nigeria gave out a total of N49.999 trillion as loans and advances to their customers between January 2016 and December 2020, data compiled by THISDAY have shown.\n\nThe banks are Access Bank Plc., Zenith Bank Plc., FBN Holdings Plc. (First Bank), United Bank for Africa Plc. (UBA), and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc. (GTBank). The data were gathered from the respective lenders\u2019 financial statements.\n\nThe data showed that in the five-year period, Access Bank lent out a total of N11.929 trillion to its customers. The amount lent by Access Bank rose sharply in the last two years due to its acquisition of former rival, Diamond Bank.\n\nAccess Bank was closely followed by Zenith Bank, whose total loans and advances in the review period stood at N11.297 trillion, despite its penchant for organic growth.\n\nFirst Bank lent out a total of N9.825 trillion in the five year-period, UBA supported its customers with a total of N9.488 trillion, while GTBank lent N7.460 trillion to its customers within same period.\n\nA further breakdown of the customers\u2019 loans and advances showed that Access Bank gave out a total of N3.218 trillion in 2020; N2.911 trillion in 2019; N1.994 trillion in 2018; N1.996 trillion in 2017; and N1.809 trillion in 2016.\n\nFor Zenith Bank, its total loans to customers in 2020 was N2.779 trillion; N2.305 trillion in 2019; N1.823 trillion in 2018; N2.100 trillion in 2017; and N2.289 trillion in 2016. In the same vein, FBN Holdings reported total customer loans and advances of N2.217 trillion in 2020; N1.852 trillion in 2019; N1.670 trillion in 2018; N2.001 trillion in 2017; and N2.084 trillion in 2016.\n\nA breakdown of the five-year period for UBA showed that in 2020 it gave out a total of N2.555 trillion as loans to its customers spread across the continent, and did N2.061 trillion in 2019, N1.715 trillion in 2018, N1.651 trillion in 2017, and N1.505 trillion in 2016.\n\nFor GTBank, in 2020 it gave out a total of N1.663 trillion as loans to its customers; N1.500 trillion in 2019; N1.259 trillion in 2018; N1.448 trillion in 2017; and N1.589 trillion in 2016.\n\nDespite the relatively high aggregate loan, experts say there is need for financial institutions to do more considering the country\u2019s wide infrastructure gap, which reports indicate would require about $3 trillion over the next 30 years to close.\n\nGlobal management consulting firm, Mckinsey & Company, noted in a recent report that the unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 slowed down bank lending in Nigeria and forced the financial institutions to re-examine and reimagine the way they did things.\n\nThe report said, \u201cFor financially strong tier-1 banks with scale (resilient and market leaders), now is the time to consider investing in technology infrastructure and talent to expand beyond current customers and products.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic and other on-going pressures present the sector with a new vantage point from which to address structural vulnerabilities and position itself for sustainable long-term growth.\u201d\n\nTo thrive beyond the crisis, Nigerian banks would need to bolster their capital levels and grow capital faster than the rates of inflation and devaluation, the report noted.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThis will be no small feat in the current environment. Given the need to meet Basel III requirements, the possible deterioration of asset quality, and some foreign-exchange-based commitments to service, it is likely that another round of consolidation and capital raising is approaching.\u201d\n\nOn their part, Senior Analyst at Coronation Asset Management, Ope Ani, and the company\u2019s Head of Research, Guy Czartoryski, told THISDAY in a recent interview that loan growth in the present climate remained challenging, as it increased risk pressure and asset quality concerns for banks.\n\nThey pointed out that an improvement in structural issues and the overall macro environment would help assuage the concerns and spur loan growth.\n\nThe analysts stated, \u201cRecent developments around credit infrastructure (collateral registries, credit bureaus) have certainly been positive with respect to driving risk asset creation. So, there is a foundation for banks to increase their loan books going forward. However, loan growth also needs to be looked at in the context of capital.\n\n\u201cThe distribution of capital across the banks featured in the report is unequal in terms of the percentage of total capital to assets (or, more technically, interest-earning assets). We have seen some banks hold back by not wanting to increase capital and actually changing their strategy to maximise the returns from the loan portfolios that they already have.\n\n\u201cSo, for loan growth to take place, and because it requires capital, it is necessary to achieve and maintain a certain level of profitability. Of course, the regulator\u2019s response, in the middle of 2019, was to impose the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) regime that requires banks to make customer loans equivalent to 65 per cent of their deposits.\n\n\u201cThis worked very well in 2019, with overall gross loans rising sharply. However, once most banks were compliant with it, the effects of the policy were not as strong during 2020.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Court Adjourns Nnamdi Kanu's Trial As Nigeria's Secret Police Fail To Produce Him In Court\n\n\u201cBoth countries also have extradition laws that prohibit this sort of reprehensible conduct that saw Kanu to Nigeria.

And that the Nigerian bench warrant standing against Kanu is, in the absence of any successful extradition proceedings in Kenya, invalid to arrest in Kenya.\n\n\u201cI also requested the Commission to adopt other urgent measures as the Commission sees fit in the circumstances to protect Nnamdi Kanu in the interim.

So, Nigeria, whether it admits it or not, has triggered a hornet\u2019s nest that has, for the first time, brought the international legal order to bear on the matter of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja had on Monday adjourned the trial of Kanu to October 21, due to failure of Nigerian Government to produce him in court on Monday.",

          "title": "This US-based early-stage fund wants to invest $5m in African startups",
          "text": "In the first half of this year, investments in African startups have risen back to pre-covid levels. While there\u2019s more excitement about big investment firms like Sequoia and Tiger Global who are making bold statements about their interest in Africa with their investments, some newer players are looking to take part in the action.\n\nOne of such players is Expert DOJO, a US-based early-stage fund that has decided to commit up to $5m to invest in African startups this year. It\u2019ll be making 20 to 50 new investments.\n\nSince the firm\u2019s first fund launched in 2018, Expert DOJO has invested in over 100 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across 30 countries. Some of these companies include Shipsi, Squadra and Woodpecker.\n\nExpert DOJO decided to focus more on Africa when it noticed that some of the strongest performers in its portfolio were from across Africa.\n\nSetting itself apart from other global accelerators, Expert DOJO has assembled an entire Africa-dedicated team plus cross-functional experts and Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs).\n\nIn addition to its new fund, the firm will dedicate an Africa-only cohort this September 2021 (currently accepting applications) to startups targeting the African market. Similar to the international cohort program, for this cohort, Expert DOJO, is looking to provide $100,000 in funding and a three-month virtual accelerator program.\n\nWhich startups qualify for this? Tech-enabled startups with a proven and scalable product. These startups also must have their main operations based in Africa and generate at least $5,000 monthly recurring revenue.\n\nStarNews Mobile, a mobile video network for Africa, is one of the first African startups Expert DOJO invested in. It currently has over 10m mobile subscribers across Africa and has secured content partnerships with Universal and Sony Music distribution as well as marketing partnerships with Pan-African mobile operators MTN, Orange, and Moov.\n\nHow was Expert DOJO helpful to StarNews Mobile? \u201cThey helped with introducing us to service providers like Accountant, legal counsel and digital marketing. They also provided strategic advice,\u201d Guy Kamgaing, the company\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for investment in 2019 when Expert DOJO invested. But the turning point for him was when he realized that apart from money, Expert DOJO had a support network and were focused on understanding Africa better.\n\n\u201cOver the years,\u201d Kamgaing said, \u201cExpert DOJO has been consistent in terms of their interest and commitment to African companies.\u201d\n\nBrian Mac Mahon (Expert DOJO) and Guy Kamgaing (StarNews)\n\nFor Brian Mac Machon, the founder of Expert DOJO, they were motivated by the success of startups like StarNews to invest further in Africa.\n\n\u201cOne commonality we\u2019ve seen throughout our Africa portfolio is these founders\u2019 focus on growth from day one, with extraordinary resilience, grit, and most importantly, results. We\u2019ve witnessed these startups take the tools and resources provided in the DOJO accelerator and scale at super speed, well beyond industry standards,\u201d Mac Machon said.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about Expert DOJO?\n\n65% of DOJO\u2019s portfolio companies are women or minority-led. \u201cWith a valuation of $32M and the third most active startup accelerator in the United States, Expert DOJO aims to close the global inequities in venture capital funding: \u201cWe\u2019re investing in founders who represent the diverse society we live in, and not just the privileged Silicon Valley elite,\u201d Mac Mahon said.\n\nAnother of Expert DOJO\u2019s notable investments is Klasha, a female-led Nigerian fintech startup.\n\nJess Anuna, CEO of Klasha shared her DOJO experience by saying that DOJO works relentlessly to secure funding for their startups and ensure they\u2019re being introduced to the right investors that will help their company scale, invest in future rounds, and strategically align with their company\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nFor startups that go through Expert DOJO\u2019s acceleration program the support received goes beyond the three months. Victoria Mehran, an Investment associate at Expert Dojo explained this saying, \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting them for life. We are hopping on growth strategy calls with all our founders. Brian is on the phone with founders from 5 am to 11 pm and same thing with other members of the team.\u201d\n\nExpert Dojo\u2019s inaugural Africa cohort is only the beginning of its plans in Africa. The hope is that they will start an Africa-only fund in the near future.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "JULY 25, 2021\n\nThis newsletter is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that will serve as a post-pandemic guide. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT. Hello, A few days ago, I re-watched \u201cThe Founder\u201d \u2013 the movie about McDonald\u2019s origins. Or to be specific, about how Ray Kroc crookedly (sort of) usurped the original founders to build the world\u2019s most efficient fast food chain. The pivotal moment, when Kroc meets the finance guy, is worth savoring again:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to realize what business you\u2019re in. You\u2019re not in the burger business, you\u2019re in the real-estate business. You don\u2019t build an empire off a 1.4% cut of a 15-cent hamburger. You build it by owning the land upon which that burger is cooked.\u201d\n\nSix decades later, McDonald\u2019s is still primarily a multibillion dollar real-estate business. Tech companies today use McDonald\u2019s as a lesson in scaling. Stripe is not a payment processing company but one building \u201ceconomic infrastructure for the internet.\u201d Just as Google became the internet\u2019s knowledge infrastructure two decades ago. What does scale look like in Africa? Fintech is the continent\u2019s hot cake so let\u2019s start there. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nHave you tried Flutterwave Mobile today? The Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, today\u2019s story.\n\nThe top 4% No standard definitions exist for what scale is for fintech in Africa. But one effort by the Wheeler Institute at the London School of Business can be a guide. Here are five key numbers from the report: Out of 716 fintech companies pooled across Africa, only 37 have achieved scale. 20 out of those 37 companies are headquartered in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. On average, it takes 12 years for a African fintech company to scale; only 5 startups have managed to scale within 5 years of operations.\n\nOlanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Also, those 37 include \u2018fintech\u2019 units launched by Airtel and MTN. So we really only have 4% scale prevalence in African fintech.\n\nThese numbers are not pretty. Is Africa not a huge market populated by young people with internet-enabled smartphones? Why are the fintech companies serving them not scaling? The report gives two explanations: Fragmentation: Many tech companies have not overcome the complex aspects of implementing their ideas in practice. A major complexity is the existence of different (and sometimes harsh) regulations from one country to another. Low-income: How many people can pay for the services being offered? An \u201caddressable market\u201d is demand \u2013 the number of people \u201cwilling and able to pay\u201d \u2013 not population. Goodwill may attract but it is self-interest that converts. Putting it bluntly, the report states that \u201cscaling a business that serves lower income tiers is notoriously hard.\u201d It\u2019s a reality check for those who dream of capturing the next billion from Africans at the bottom of the pyramid. Beware of \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d apps. However, it\u2019s not all bad news. One interesting takeaway is that \u201cinfrastructure\u201d fintech companies are likely to scale in Africa. Olanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Infrastructure fintechs, according to the report, are those providing payment gateways, building banking-as-a-service applications or aggregating services into APIs. Of the 96 fintech companies defined as being in the sub-sector, 10% have scaled. Interswitch, MFS Africa and Fawry probably typify the infrastructure fintechs but I am surprised that certain names are not listed among the scaled in this sub-sector. Is a multimillion-dollar acquisition not a signal of scale? How about a presence in 30 countries with over $50m in annual revenue? The researchers explain their methodology in the report. Whatever those answers, the important thing to note is that companies building the rails for other services (financial and non-financial) in Africa are likely to expand quickly. But scale is not just for B2B fintechs. Carbon and Branch, two digital lending companies, make the case that it is possible to scale by serving consumers efficiently. Both have recently evolved to digital banks. Carbon staking out a claim to lead Buy Now Pay Later in Africa \u2013 in other words, to become infrastructure for lending. Perhaps another report with a different yardstick will reveal other scaled fintechs in Africa. For now, we can look deeper into the top 4% to see how they arrived where they currently are. Like McDonald\u2019s, did they all scale by owning land instead of burgers and fries? FROM THE CABAL In case you missed these:\n\n\n\nSenegal will produce rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 from 2022, thanks to a tech transfer deal involving two major biotech companies. The technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from biotech companies to DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit in Dakar. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa. In Ethiopia, Dashen bank has partnered with Thunes , a Singapore-based global payments network, to facilitate fund transfers from around the world to the Horn of Africa nation. It\u2019s the latest in a series of recent events signalling Ethiopia\u2019s increasingly open financial industry.

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is a pre-seed & seed firm for elite tech founders tackling critical problems in the continent\u2019s largest markets.\n\nVoltron will deploy capital in up to 30 startups across a range of sectors in a bid to \u201caddress the severe lack of access to early-stage funding for African tech companies.\u201d\n\nWith a ticket size of $20,000 \u2013 $100,000 per company, the VC\u2019s portfolio will primarily focus on startups in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and North Africa.\n\nSoyombo is an experienced angel investor and founder. In 2008, he co-founded Bluechip Technologies \u2014 provides data warehousing solutions and enterprise applications to banks, telcos, insurance firms \u2014 with a friend, Kazeem Ewogbade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, He ventured into tech once again, partnering with Ewogbade to found LeadPath Nigeria, an early-stage firm-cum-accelerator.\n\nThey planned to invest $25,000, take the startups through a three-month accelerator programme ending in a Demo Day. It was a Y Combinator of sorts, but they quickly discovered a snag in their plans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Soyombo found that getting investors to pitch to was a problem. They ended up funding the startups themselves and eventually began investing individually\n\nLeadPath became a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the pair to carry out their angel investing deals. This sometimes involved calling upon High net-worth individuals (HNIs) not directly involved in the tech space.\n\nWith this, Soyombo has decided to formalise the funding process, bringing his access to non-traditional capital to bear.\n\nHe has a portfolio of 33 African tech startups, including Mono, PiggyVest, Spleet, Migo, TeamApt and Paystack, raising over $70m, ranging from pre-seed to Series A.\n\nChoi, CEO and founder of Simple Dealer, has also invested in 15 tech startups \u2014 two of which have been exited, and collectively, the founders\u2019 existing portfolio spreads across a vast range of sectors, including finance, energy, logistics, retail, and education.\n\nSpeaking on the launch, Soyombo says, \u201cVoltron Capital is the beginning of another incredibly exciting journey for Abe and I, but it is also a celebration of the road Africa\u2019s entire tech space has travelled to date.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith their combined history, Soyombo says, \u201cWe want the next wave of African tech success stories to not only make an impact on the continent but to be truly global; through Abe\u2019s strategic connections to the USA, we\u2019re confident we can provide our portfolio with the best possible opportunities to achieve this through our US and global network.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmolabake Adenle, a Nigerian-American investment strategist and engineer has won the DEI In Voice award from Women in Voice (WiV) \u2014 an international non-profit based in Seattle, United States of America \u2014 for outstanding contributions to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in voice.\n\nThe Cambridge University alumna got the attention after building a voice recognition and speech synthesis software for five African languages. Adenle believes she was singled out among the three other finalists in the category because her solution fills the gap for the availability of voice technologies for African languages.\n\nAdenle, a PhD holder in Bayesian Signal Processing, is the founder of an app development studio, Aja.la Studios which was rebranded to become Ajala.ai following a pivot.\n\nAfter her PhD, she decided not to go into academia, instead, she went with consulting in investment banking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by her cousins learning English alphabets via an app, she decided to build an app that could also help them learn the Yoruba language.\n\nCalled SpeakYoruba, the paid app was published on Google Play Store in 2010 \u2014 but it is no longer available on the platform. Subsequently, she got requests to build something similar for other languages, but she couldn\u2019t oblige because of her demanding day job.\n\n\u201cA few years ago when I decided I want to start a business, I thought I could revisit this app that did well and see if I could come up with something that could build up on that. I wanted to add a feature that would allow children to say something to the app, and the app will tell them whether they said the word currently. It was at that point that I realised that voice recognition wasn\u2019t really available for African languages,\u201d she explains in a chat with Techpoint Africa.\n\nSo, she decided not to limit the solution to the app and saw it as an opportunity to build something broader. Pitching the idea to Innovate UK, she got a grant to explore the idea further.\n\nAnd in the first year, she developed complex algorithms and acoustic models for voice recognition and speech synthesis for two African languages using deep learning. Seeing the progress, she received a seed fund from the same agency in 2018.\n\nFor context, speech recognition is the underlying technology behind the likes of Siri and Alexa; it makes the digital assistant understand what is said to it and translate it to text, while speech synthesis allows the AI to speak back with articulated voice.\n\nAdenle\u2019s plan is to build a solution-agnostic platform that provides broad support for as many African languages as possible. That means it won\u2019t be focusing on a particular app, but it would allow other developers to build on it for their bespoke localised solutions. Think of it as an API.\n\nMeanwhile, the solution is still in the beta phase, with plans to officially launch in Q4 2021. It will work for five African languages \u2014 Yoruba, Hausa, Ibo, Kiswahili, and Kinyarwanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from the seed fund, Ajala.ai is also in partnership with two large African institutions looking to build voice solutions in African languages.\n\nSpeaking of the future of her startup, Adenle\u2019s plan is to build more solutions that address Africa\u2019s unique needs.\n\nIn the meantime, watch this place for a detailed piece about who Adenle is and her journey to digitising African languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I wonder why people will say I was arrested with $2 million in my pocket or suitcase for the governor.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe rate of drug abuse in Nigeria, particularly among the youths is assuming an alarming dimension.\n\nA recent data released by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), showed that over 20 million Nigerians are involved in drug abuse out of which 60 per cent are youths.\n\nMostly involved are youths in higher institutions and in the entertainment sector.\n\nDr Obi Adagwu, an expert on drug control, explained that the resurgence of drug use among the youths is due to poor enforcement and inadequate policy to curtail it.\n\n\u201cHow many drug rehabilitation centres exist in the country? The few we have, how effective are they?\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the war against drug abuse should start from homes, as most parents who are supposed to be mentors do not monitor their children.\n\n\u201cSome parents do not even know at what point their children got involved with drugs.\n\n\u201cThe fight against drug abuse should also be taken to government offices, there are so many government officials abusing drugs,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAdagwu who is a psychologist, also blamed the government for not giving sufficient support to agencies with the mandate to check drug abuse.\n\nNDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, who spoke on the efforts of the agency to tackle drug abuse, said that over 400 suspects and large quantities of drugs were intercepted in the past few months by officials of the agency from various routes, including airports.\n\nAccording to him, over 200 cases are at various stages of prosecution.\n\n\u201c We solicit media support and other Nigerians to give information to the agency, no effort shall be spared to rid the country of illicit drugs, \u2018\u2019he added.\n\nMr James Ojomo, an expert in drug abuse, says many of the major towns including Kano, Kaduna, Abuja and Lagos are veritable grounds for drug abusers.\n\n\u201c For some time, the country was not serious in waging war against drug abuse, as we were treating it with kid grooves.\n\n\u201cIllicit drug users and its barons were having a field day, turning the country into a destination route rather than a transit.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing restructuring of NDLEA, and a new henchman in the person of Buba Marwa, the agency has been rejuvenated and the war has just begun,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOjomo says that what is expected from the rest of us is to give information and expose barons amongst us that are threatening to destroy our youths and the future of the country.\n\nSome concerned Nigerians say that over the years, successive regimes in Nigeria had taken steps to improve the country\u2019s reputation as an international drug trafficking centre.\n\nAccording to them, most of the emphasis had fallen on law enforcement and repression, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of arrests and prison population.\n\nIn spite of such severe measures, experts say a correlative fall in drug consumption has not been witnessed.\n\nThey added that with the renewed effort by the NDLEA and support from the Federal Government, the war against drug abuse will be tackled and won in no distant time.\n\nThey also stressed the need to strengthen the law against drug use.\n\nProf. Isiodore Obot, the Director, Centre for Research and Information on Substance Abuse, said that Nigeria had failed in its drug war, considering the large number of youths involved in drug usage and abuse.\n\nObot, who spoke at the Youthrise Nigeria Drug Policy Training for media practitioners recently in Abuja, said in spite criminalising drug use for many years, this had not achieved its goal of eliminating drug production and use.\n\nAccording to him, the nation\u2019s perspective about drugs from a criminal justice system perspective needs to be changed to healthcare system perspective.\n\nObot, who is also a psychologist, declared that drug use was much more than a criminal issue, but one with many health and social implications, including fighting, violence, among others.\n\nHe said drug use cuts across all social classes and gender, adding that what may be different is what type of drug they are using.\n\nHe listed illegal drugs commonly used as cannabis sativa, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants and inhalants and solvents such as glue.\n\nProf. Mojisola Adeyeye, the Director-General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), attributed the high rate of drug abuse to lack of control of prescribed drugs, among others.\n\nAdeyeye who spoke at an event to mark the 2020 International Drug Awareness Day in Abuja, said other factors responsible for drug abuse are the love for money by peddlers, unemployment, disobedience to the laws of the land.\n\nOther reasons she identified as responsible for drug abuse are smuggling substances through our porous seaports and land borders, corruption and light penalties for the sellers and traffickers.\n\nAccording to her, the only way to check abuse is for the government to develop and enforce a National Prescription Policy.\n\nAdeyeye appealed to the three arms of government not to relent on its efforts in the fight against drug abuse, stressing that they have a major role to play by putting in place, stiffer penalties, that are commensurate with the offences of drug abuse.\n\nShe called on ministries, departments and agencies, religious bodies, educational institutions and parents to join hands with government in the fight against drug abuse.\n\nWhile identifying drugs like tramadol and codeine as the most commonly abused drugs in the country, the NAFDAC D-G had this to say: \u201cTramadol is a synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pains and is the most abused medicine among addicts.\n\n\u201cTramadol and codeine are regulated as 50mg and 100mg dosage strengths, but very high dosage forms of 200mg and 225 mg have infiltrated the market,\u201d she added.\n\nShe advised youths in the country to desist from drug abuse as it portends very high risks such as arrhythmias, cramps, coma, and death.\n\n\u201cWe need to rescue our youths from the use of illicit drugs, to achieve this, all hands must be on deck, relevant agencies must work together,\u2019\u2019 she emphasised.\n\n_________________________\n\nJulius Enehikhuere, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n...",

          "text": "Sterling Bank Plc. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Cross River State Government and a consortium of healthcare providers to provide services for the Cross River Health Supply Chain Transformation Project.\n\nSpeaking at the signing ceremony in Lagos over the weekend, Mr. Obinna Ukachukwu, Divisional Head, Health and Education Sectors with Sterling Bank, said, \u201cI am excited that this is happening. It is the beginning of good things to come and I hope other states in the country would replicate the strategy that has been put in place by the Cross River State Government to address the challenges in its health supply chain.\u201d\n\nHe said Sterling Bank would de-risk any sector of the Nigerian economy that is willing to adopt a similar strategy through re-imagining finance. This is about putting in place the structure to render service before introducing formal banking transactions in a bid to ensure a win-win situation for the parties involved in the arrangement, he said.\n\nThe MoU is sequel to the bank\u2019s partnership with the Cross River State Government on the implementation of a Health Insurance Scheme tagged: Ayade Care. The scheme was launched recently in Calabar, the state capital, as part of an effort to achieve health insurance cover for vulnerable citizens in Cross River.\n\nUkachukwu explained that health is one of the five sectors where Sterling Bank is concentrating investments under its HEART\u2019s of Sterling programme in a bid to make impact in the Nigerian economy. The other sectors are Education, Agriculture, Renewable Energy and Transportation.\n\nAlso speaking, Dr. Betta Edu, Commissioner for Health, Cross River State, expressed happiness at state\u2019s readiness to finally implement the Health Supply Chain Transformation Project. She explained that the state\u2019s healthcare policy revolves around providing quality healthcare services through universal health coverage, adding that there is absolutely no way the state could achieve its objective without functional pharmaceutical services.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe are ready to drive this innovative arrangement to get results and what is very important to us is to ensure that people get universal access to quality medicines. We will ensure that people in rural areas, general hospitals, secondary facilities and private facilities, primary healthcare centres and even dispensaries have access to drugs.\n\n\u201cWe will open the entire horizon to those who are coming in from primary institutions. We hope to run it with the speed of light because we have lost some time already and we hope in the next two to three months, we will be ready with facilities and drugs so that we can be up and running.\u201d\n\nDr. Edu said the state government would like to shift emphasis from being directly involved in the healthcare sector and restrict itself to regulatory and supportive roles while adopting a private sector driven approach like India. According to her, health services in India jumped from zero level to about 90 percent with the adoption of private sector involvement in its health care sector.\n\nBesides Sterling Bank and Cross River State Government, other parties in the Health Supply Chain Transformation Project include Horts Medikals Limited, Drugstoc and Zipline. Under the arrangement, Horts Medikals will purchase all the pharmaceutical products for Drugstoc to warehouse while Zipline will use drone technology to deliver them across the state.",

          "title": "My journey: A personal story \u2013 By KINGSLEY MOGHALU",
          "text": "As a young man out of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (Enugu Campus) in the mid-80s, I consciously sought and acquired experience that would position me for leadership on the world stage and in my country. First I did my National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) assignment as a Legal Officer at Shell Nigeria HQ in Lagos.\n\nFirst class global multinational. Dominant in Nigeria\u2019s petroleum industry. I worked hard as a \u201cCorper\u201d and was kept very professionally busy by my supervisors Dr. V.O. Achimu the Company Secretary and Head of Legal, and Mrs. Efe Omole, a senior corporate lawyer in Shell. Then I joined Newswatch, founded by Nigeria\u2019s most influential journalists of that era, the quartet Dele Giwa, Ray Ekpu, Dan Agbese, and Yakubu Mohammed, as its general counsel. In media, \u2019twas THE PLACE.\n\nTo further internationalize my CV, and doubling as a lawyer/journalist, I became a special correspondent for influential foreign newspapers and magazines of the era such as South magazine, Christian Science Monitor, and Africa News (today\u2019s AllAfrica Global Media). But I wanted, as I put it on my CV as my goal, \u201ca career of distinction in international affairs\u201d. Possibly in the Nigerian Foreign Service, following the footsteps of my now-deceased dad, but preferably in an international organization like the United Nations, Commonwealth Secretariat, or in the Organization of African Unity (now African Union ). That meant, at the very least, getting a master\u2019s degree. From where? I thought it through, and had been advised by my own research and by mentors that one of the best moves for such a career was to obtain a master\u2019s from the prestigious Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, USA.\n\nI applied while working at Newswatch. I was admitted in 1990, but could not afford the $25,000 tuition fee. But I was determined. I deferred the admission by one year, and started looking for money. All the rich businessmen I approached turned me down.\n\nFrustrated, I wrote to Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, immediate past Foreign Minister of Nigeria in the Ibrahim Babangida government. Akinyemi was an alumnus of The Fletcher School, having obtained his master\u2019s degree there in 1966 and then gone on to Oxford University for his Ph.D.\n\nHe replied and gave me an appointment to see him (no email then, everything was by snail mail! so all this took several days!). I met him in his office then on Victoria Island, introduced myself and submitted my CV. He read it with interest, and was impressed.\n\n\u201cWell, young man\u201d, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the kind of money that will enable me pay your fees, but I\u2019m impressed you were admitted to The Fletcher School. I will write to the school and recommend you for some sort of support and let\u2019s see how they respond\u201d. I was relieved.\n\nThis \u201cBig Man\u201d did not know the struggling young man from Adam, but had given me audience and was actually trying to help. \u201cGod, I am in your hands\u201d I prayed silently. He asked me to come back & take a copy of the letter he wrote. I did. In two short, powerfully constructed paragraphs of his letter addressed to Professor Jeswald Salacuse, Dean of The Fletcher School at the time, Akinyemi introduced me as \u201ca future leader in Africa\u201d, and said my impressive CV at the young age of 27 was an indicator of this assessment in his view. He then asked the school to consider me for financial support to enrol.\n\nTwo months later I received a letter from Fletcher awarding me the Joan Gillespie Fellowship for identified future leaders from India, Nigeria and Algeria. Now to get a visa and leave. Ray Ekpu, my boss at Newswatch, and Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Managing Director of The Guardian at the time, introduced me to the United States Embassy in Nigeria. The American Embassy was impressed with my admission to The Fletcher School , a training ground for many American and world leaders in diplomacy, politics, business, military and security affairs. The embassy asked me to send over my passport but not bother to come physically to their office in Victoria Island, Lagos. They stamped my student visa and on top of it, awarded me a travel grant that covered my air travel ticket to the US!\n\nWhen I arrived at Tufts University, the world opened up. I worked hard to excel academically and survive financially, serving two professors as their research assistant and somewhat envious of the American students from wealthy homes who had credit cards given them by their parents and did not need to work.\n\nFrom The Fletcher School I joined the UN, my dream career. I started as a junior Associate Officer and rose to the rank of Director and later served on a special assignment at the political rank of Under-Secretary-General. From conflict resolution and nation building assignments in Cambodia, at UN Headquarters in New York on the Angola, Rwanda and Somalia Desks under the supervision of Kofi Annan, back to the field in Croatia and later as Legal Adviser and Spokesman of the International Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, and then to the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland as Head of the Global Partnerships and Resource Mobilization Team at the $20 billion Global Fund in which I also played risk management roles, it was a versatile, satisfying and successful career.\n\nIn 2006 while I was based in Geneva with WHO, Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed me a member of the high-level Redesign Panel on the UN Internal Justice System. Working at UN HQ in New York for six months with Mary Gaudron , our chairperson and an Australian Supreme Court Justice, Louise Otis, Canadian Appeals Court Judge, eminent Egyptian international lawyer Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri, and Diego Garcia Sayan, former Foreign Minister of Peru, we overhauled the internal dispute resolution (between staff and management), accountability and transparency framework governing the world body\u2019s 60,000 staff around the world as a core component of management reform. The UN General Assembly ratified our recommendations and voted them into UN administrative law. It was a watershed moment in the history of internal UN governance.\n\nWhile in Geneva, I enrolled in January 2004 as a part-time PH.D. candidate in International Relations at the London School of Economics (LSE). I wrote my 500-page doctoral dissertation in 12 months, shattering all previous records at the university, and graduated in October 2005 with a doctoral degree. In December 2008 I resigned from the UN after nearly 17 years and founded Sogato Strategies, a risk management consultancy in Geneva serving global multinationals seeking business opportunities in Africa.\n\nThis enjoyable experience of self-employment was suspended when I was appointed Deputy\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua of blessed memory, on the recommendation of then Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, and confirmed by the Senate. The CBN was, and is a very powerful and consequential institution. This development, however, was a disruption of my earlier plans. But it was, I came to believe later, divinely ordered for reasons only God knows fully. It came out of a seemingly \u201cby-chance\u201d encounter with Sanusi at the World Economic Forum meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, where he proposed the idea, entirely of his own volition and unsolicited, of my returning home to Nigeria to serve as his deputy and head the CBN\u2019s Financial System Stability (FSS) Directorate that would implement the extensive reform in the banking sector that he had in mind. (Sanusi was just roughly a week into his confirmation by the Senate as the CBN Governor at this time). He later ran his decision to recommend me to Yar\u2019Adua by Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, then Managing Director of the World Bank, and she gave her strong agreement with it.\n\nWhen I reported for duty at the CBN on November 6, 2009 after the Senate confirmed my appointment a week earlier on October 27 (my appointment had been announced in August by Segun Adeniyi, Spokesman for President Yar\u2019Adua) I found several letters of congratulation waiting for me. One of the ones that meant the most to me was one from Prof. Akinyemi. \u201cDear Deputy Governor\u201d, he wrote, \u201cNeed I say anything more? Congratulations\u201d. That was it. Two sentences, harking back to our meeting and his intervention 19 years earlier in 1990.\n\nI am proud to have served my country in such an important leadership role where I made contributions that reformed our financial sector and payments system, including the development and introduction of the Bank Verification Number (BVN). In the CBN Monetary Policy Committee, we progressively brought inflation down to a single-digit 8% by 2014.\n\nAfter a five year tenure at the CBN, I was appointed a Professor on the faculty of The Fletcher School and taught the course Emerging Africa in the World Economy for two academic years. This was by courtesy of another helping hand: Admiral (Dr.) James Stavridis (Rtd), Dean of The Fletcher School and former Supreme Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the military alliance of the Great Powers of the western world, who himself is also a Fletcher alum. It was an honor to have gone to school there; to be appointed a professor at this top global graduate school of international affairs was a double honor.\n\nBut while teaching at Tufts University from 2015-2017, my mind turned to the increasing poverty and insecurity at home in Nigeria. I began asking myself why I was in Boston developing the human capital of citizens of the United States, Japan, France, Canada, Ghana, Switzerland, etc when my country was clearly adrift. I made the decision to return home to run for President in 2019. The rest is recent history.\n\nThe morale of this story for young people is this: think beyond mere success to impact and consequence in whatever you do. Work hard, and be very strategic. I always aimed for the best of institutions in my career and did not settle for less. I know, the world today is very different, but it offers even more opportunities, and success has become more democratized with the age of the internet, globalization, and high technology. But the same principles apply.\n\nAll of this, and much else, are what I bring to my current aspiration: I want to help build a nation that will give our youth great opportunities in the 21st century. We are all God\u2019s children too, entitled to a place in the sun. Africa, and Nigeria, will truly rise one day! It\u2019s always darkest before dawn.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Akinyemi was an alumnus of The Fletcher School, having obtained his master\u2019s degree there in 1966 and then gone on to Oxford University for his Ph.D.\n\nHe replied and gave me an appointment to see him (no email then, everything was by snail mail! so all this took several days!). I met him in his office then on Victoria Island, introduced myself and submitted my CV. He read it with interest, and was impressed.\n\n\u201cWell, young man\u201d, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have the kind of money that will enable me pay your fees, but I\u2019m impressed you were admitted to The Fletcher School. I will write to the school and recommend you for some sort of support and let\u2019s see how they respond\u201d. I was relieved.\n\nThis \u201cBig Man\u201d did not know the struggling young man from Adam, but had given me audience and was actually trying to help. \u201cGod, I am in your hands\u201d I prayed silently. He asked me to come back & take a copy of the letter he wrote. I did. In two short, powerfully constructed paragraphs of his letter addressed to Professor Jeswald Salacuse, Dean of The Fletcher School at the time, Akinyemi introduced me as \u201ca future leader in Africa\u201d, and said my impressive CV at the young age of 27 was an indicator of this assessment in his view. He then asked the school to consider me for financial support to enrol.\n\nTwo months later I received a letter from Fletcher awarding me the Joan Gillespie Fellowship for identified future leaders from India, Nigeria and Algeria. Now to get a visa and leave. Ray Ekpu, my boss at Newswatch, and Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Managing Director of The Guardian at the time, introduced me to the United States Embassy in Nigeria. The American Embassy was impressed with my admission to The Fletcher School , a training ground for many American and world leaders in diplomacy, politics, business, military and security affairs. The embassy asked me to send over my passport but not bother to come physically to their office in Victoria Island, Lagos. They stamped my student visa and on top of it, awarded me a travel grant that covered my air travel ticket to the US!\n\nWhen I arrived at Tufts University, the world opened up. I worked hard to excel academically and survive financially, serving two professors as their research assistant and somewhat envious of the American students from wealthy homes who had credit cards given them by their parents and did not need to work.\n\nFrom The Fletcher School I joined the UN, my dream career. I started as a junior Associate Officer and rose to the rank of Director and later served on a special assignment at the political rank of Under-Secretary-General. From conflict resolution and nation building assignments in Cambodia, at UN Headquarters in New York on the Angola, Rwanda and Somalia Desks under the supervision of Kofi Annan, back to the field in Croatia and later as Legal Adviser and Spokesman of the International Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, and then to the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland as Head of the Global Partnerships and Resource Mobilization Team at the $20 billion Global Fund in which I also played risk management roles, it was a versatile, satisfying and successful career.\n\nIn 2006 while I was based in Geneva with WHO, Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed me a member of the high-level Redesign Panel on the UN Internal Justice System. Working at UN HQ in New York for six months with Mary Gaudron , our chairperson and an Australian Supreme Court Justice, Louise Otis, Canadian Appeals Court Judge, eminent Egyptian international lawyer Professor Ahmed El-Kosheri, and Diego Garcia Sayan, former Foreign Minister of Peru, we overhauled the internal dispute resolution (between staff and management), accountability and transparency framework governing the world body\u2019s 60,000 staff around the world as a core component of management reform. The UN General Assembly ratified our recommendations and voted them into UN administrative law. It was a watershed moment in the history of internal UN governance.\n\nWhile in Geneva, I enrolled in January 2004 as a part-time PH.D. candidate in International Relations at the London School of Economics (LSE). I wrote my 500-page doctoral dissertation in 12 months, shattering all previous records at the university, and graduated in October 2005 with a doctoral degree. In December 2008 I resigned from the UN after nearly 17 years and founded Sogato Strategies, a risk management consultancy in Geneva serving global multinationals seeking business opportunities in Africa.\n\nThis enjoyable experience of self-employment was suspended when I was appointed Deputy\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua of blessed memory, on the recommendation of then Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, and confirmed by the Senate. The CBN was, and is a very powerful and consequential institution. This development, however, was a disruption of my earlier plans. But it was, I came to believe later, divinely ordered for reasons only God knows fully. It came out of a seemingly \u201cby-chance\u201d encounter with Sanusi at the World Economic Forum meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, where he proposed the idea, entirely of his own volition and unsolicited, of my returning home to Nigeria to serve as his deputy and head the CBN\u2019s Financial System Stability (FSS) Directorate that would implement the extensive reform in the banking sector that he had in mind. (Sanusi was just roughly a week into his confirmation by the Senate as the CBN Governor at this time). He later ran his decision to recommend me to Yar\u2019Adua by Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, then Managing Director of the World Bank, and she gave her strong agreement with it.\n\nWhen I reported for duty at the CBN on November 6, 2009 after the Senate confirmed my appointment a week earlier on October 27 (my appointment had been announced in August by Segun Adeniyi, Spokesman for President Yar\u2019Adua) I found several letters of congratulation waiting for me. One of the ones that meant the most to me was one from Prof. Akinyemi. \u201cDear Deputy Governor\u201d, he wrote, \u201cNeed I say anything more? Congratulations\u201d. That was it. Two sentences, harking back to our meeting and his intervention 19 years earlier in 1990.\n\nI am proud to have served my country in such an important leadership role where I made contributions that reformed our financial sector and payments system, including the development and introduction of the Bank Verification Number (BVN). In the CBN Monetary Policy Committee, we progressively brought inflation down to a single-digit 8% by 2014.\n\nAfter a five year tenure at the CBN, I was appointed a Professor on the faculty of The Fletcher School and taught the course Emerging Africa in the World Economy for two academic years. This was by courtesy of another helping hand: Admiral (Dr.) James Stavridis (Rtd), Dean of The Fletcher School and former Supreme Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the military alliance of the Great Powers of the western world, who himself is also a Fletcher alum. It was an honor to have gone to school there; to be appointed a professor at this top global graduate school of international affairs was a double honor.\n\nBut while teaching at Tufts University from 2015-2017, my mind turned to the increasing poverty and insecurity at home in Nigeria. I began asking myself why I was in Boston developing the human capital of citizens of the United States, Japan, France, Canada, Ghana, Switzerland, etc when my country was clearly adrift. I made the decision to return home to run for President in 2019. The rest is recent history.\n\nThe morale of this story for young people is this: think beyond mere success to impact and consequence in whatever you do. Work hard, and be very strategic. I always aimed for the best of institutions in my career and did not settle for less. I know, the world today is very different, but it offers even more opportunities, and success has become more democratized with the age of the internet, globalization, and high technology. But the same principles apply.\n\nAll of this, and much else, are what I bring to my current aspiration: I want to help build a nation that will give our youth great opportunities in the 21st century. We are all God\u2019s children too, entitled to a place in the sun. Africa, and Nigeria, will truly rise one day! It\u2019s always darkest before dawn.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Umar el-Yahya, the President signed the Supplementary Appropriation Act, 2021 in his office at the State House.\n\nN123.3 million will be used for recurrent (non-debt) expenditure, while N859.3 billion would be used to contribute to the Development Fund for capital expenditure for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.\n\nBuhari praised the National Assembly for speedy deliberation and adoption of the supplementary budget, promising that the executive branch would ensure timely delivery of capital projects to meet the budget\u2019s lofty goals.\n\nThe Orthopedic Hospitals Management Board (Amendment) Act, 2021, was also signed by the President at a previous date.\n\nThe Act amends the Orthopedic Hospitals Management Board Act, Cap. O10 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 to provide for the establishment of the Orthopedic Hospital Jos, Plateau State, which will be under the control of the Orthopedic Hospitals Management Board and affiliated to the Jos Teaching Hospital to provide specialized orthopedic treatment and medical services.\n\nAfter the signing ceremony, Umar Ibrahim el-Yakub, Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives), spoke to State House Correspondents on the new Act.\n\n\u201cThe President has assented the Supplementary Appropriation Bill, so now it\u2019s Supplementary Appropriation Act, since it has been assented by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cOf course, you know, the Supplementary Appropriation Bill was submitted to the National Assembly and they made an expeditious consideration of the bill and was passed and transmitted in record time and Mr. President has today assented to that bill. It will come into force from today.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019re all aware, the bill is targeted only at infrastructure in terms of security and medical. The bill targeted the provision of infrastructure to all the military formations; Defense, Civil Defense, Police and the DSS, all the security outfits in this country will benefit from the bill because of Mr. President\u2019s commitment in combating crimes and indeed, insurgency and all the security challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cTo that end, this bill is very important and it has been assented to. Another critical area of concern is the health sector, which of course, we know with the pandemic, there is need to invest in that sector as well. Mr. President, having assented to the bill, you\u2019ll find that molecular laboratories, about 10 of them, will be established nationwide.\u201d",

Thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.\n\nFrance, the mainstay of the anti-jihadist operation, has been especially critical of the military takeover in Mali.\n\nIt suspended military cooperation after the second coup and then announced a major drawdown of its 5,100-man Barkhane mission\n\n-AFP",

It reduces credibility issues associated with manual transmission of voting tallies, reduces costs and associated risks of officials handling manual transmission.\n\n\u2018\u2018Globally, countries and enduring democracies have toed this line of practice. In Nigeria, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has courageously stated that votes can be transmitted electronically and that it has the capacity to do so.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn view of this they urged \u2018\u2018the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, to arrest, investigate and prosecute all NCC officials who participated in this ignominious perfidy on the floor of the National Assembly including external collaborators, the IGP must within 14 days carry out the aforementioned, failure of which Nigerians will be mobilized to compel him to act.\u2019\u2019\n\nOther demands include that \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari should only give assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 after the deletion of the proviso to Section 52(2) that requires transmission of election results by INEC to be subjected to clearance by NCC and the National Assembly, adding that it erodes the independence of the electoral body and would lead to crisis. The deletion of Sections 65 and 88 completely monetized the electoral process, among others.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe statement was endorsed by 124 other civil society groups.",

          "text": "Islamic human rights organization, Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has kicked against the planned inauguration of the Yoruba Nation Christian Association, YORNCA by the Power Apostolic Church International, Ojoo, Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nMURIC, in a statement issued yesterday by its director Professor Ishaq Akintola described the event billed for tomorrow, Wednesday, July 28 as an act that \u201cwill give the impression that the agitation for the establishment of a Yoruba nation is a Christian agenda.\u201d\n\nThe group, therefore, called on leaders of the Christians Association of Nigeria, CAN in Yorubaland to prevail on the leadership of the Power Apostolic Church International to shelve the inauguration plan.\n\nIt further described the inauguration plan as reckless, immature, and an attempt to put the cart before the horse.\n\nMURIC informed that letters of invitation have already been sent out to guests some of which it added was leaked and have gone viral on social media.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe assert that the inauguration of an organization that bears the name of a non-existent \u2018nation\u2019 is, to say the least, reckless, infantile, and an attempt to put the cart before the horse. Which one should come first, the \u2018nation\u2019 or the organizations that will be formed within it?\n\n\u201cDo we have the Yoruba nation already? Has the Nigerian Constitution, which describes the country as \u2018one indivisible and indissoluble Sovereign Nation\u2019 been amended yet? Can you build illegality on illegality? Can you build something upon nothing? YORNCA or whatever it calls itself should therefore wait. It cannot exist in a vacuum.\n\n\u201cMURIC pays special attention to the last sentence in the last paragraph of the letter of invitation where the organizers gave the reason for forming the organization (YORNCA): \u2018The reason being that, it is now we can catch our Land for the Lord. Shalom\n\n\u201cWe find this sentence worrisome. Because it presupposes that the real motive behind the agitation for the Yoruba nation is to \u2018catch\u2019 Yorubaland \u2018for the Lord\u2019. Well, the cat is now out of the bag. All the noise about marginalization is therefore mere smokescreen intended to deceive Yoruba Muslims in particular and the general public in general.\n\n\u201cSo, the question must be asked by rational people. Is the Yoruba nation project a Christian agenda? If not, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) should call the Power Apostolic Church International, Ojoo, Ibadan, to order. We are aware that CAN had earlier dissociated itself from all kinds of separatist and insurrectionist projects. That puts CAN in the right position and gives it the moral right to call any church which is promoting chaos to order.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, MURIC does not consider the Yoruba agitators as enemies. But we disagree with their methods. They are becoming overzealous, and they can only make things worse for the same people they claim to be fighting for. They must eschew violence, threats, blackmail, subterfuge, false propaganda, intimidation and coercion.\u201d",

          "text": "Tunisia\u2019s president has suspended parliament and dismissed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi in a move condemned as an attack on democracy by his rivals but which others greeted with celebrations on the streets.\n\nPresident Kais Saied said on Sunday he would assume executive authority with the assistance of a new prime minister after violent protests broke out in several Tunisian cities over the government\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy.\n\nIt is the biggest challenge yet to a 2014 constitution that split powers between the president, prime minister and parliament.\n\n\u201cMany people were deceived by hypocrisy, treachery and robbery of the rights of the people,\u201d he said in a statement carried on state media.\n\n\u201cI warn any who think of resorting to weapons \u2026 and whoever shoots a bullet, the armed forces will respond with bullets,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also suspended the immunity of members of parliament, insisting his actions were in line with the constitution.\n\nThe statement followed an emergency meeting at his palace after thousands of Tunisians marched in several cities, with much of the anger focused on the Ennahdha party, the biggest in parliament.\n\nTunisian Parliament Speaker Rached Ghannouchi accused President Saied of launching \u201ca coup against the revolution and constitution\u201d after the move.\n\n\u201cWe consider the institutions to be still standing and supporters of Ennahdha and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution,\u201d Ghannouchi, who heads Ennahdha, told the Reuters news agency by phone.\n\nThe party also condemned the president\u2019s move as a \u201cstate coup against the revolution\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat Kais Saied is doing is a state coup against the revolution and against the constitution, and the members of Ennahdha and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution,\u201d Ennahdha wrote in a statement on its Facebook page.\n\nSaied has been enmeshed in political disputes with Prime Minister Mechichi for more than a year, as the country grapples with an economic crisis, and a flailing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSaied and the parliament were elected in separate popular votes in 2019, while Mechichi took office last year, replacing another short-lived government.\n\nTunis-based journalist Rabeb Aloui told Al Jazeera that Saied\u2019s move did not come as a surprise, as he had threatened to dissolve parliament and sack the prime minister.\n\n\u201cSince last September we (have) lived under a political crisis,\u201d Aloui said.\n\nShe said many young Tunisians, particularly those who were protesting on Sunday, have expressed joy at the announcement.\n\nThe demonstrators had also called for social and economic reforms, however, and those issues still need to be addressed, Aloui added.\n\n\u201cWe are really living under an economic crisis, with the health crisis too [from] the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nTunisia has been overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases, with more than 18,000 people dying from the disease in the country of about 12 million.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a failure of governments and the president himself is offering no leadership,\u201d William Lawrence, a professor at the American University in Washington DC and an expert on Tunisia, told Al Jazeera. \u201cHis solution is to fire people, a bit like the former president of the United States. Despite the jubilation in certain corners of Tunisia, there is not widespread jubilation I don\u2019t think. So far, we don\u2019t see a president who has the authority or the ability to solve the problems (Tunisia faces).\u201d\n\nThousands of people had defied virus restrictions and the scorching heat to demonstrate earlier on Sunday in Tunis, the capital, and other cities. The crowds of mostly young people shouted \u201cGet out!\u201d and slogans calling for the dissolution of parliament and early elections.\n\nThe protests were called on the 64th anniversary of Tunisia\u2019s independence by a new group called the July 25 Movement.\n\nThere was heavy security presence, especially in Tunis where police blockades blocked all streets leading to the capital\u2019s main road, Avenue Bourguiba. The avenue was a key site for the Tunisian revolution 10 years ago that brought down a dictatorial government and unleashed the Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nA Tunisian protester lifts a national flag at an anti-government rally as security forces block off the road in front of the parliament in the capital Tunis [Fethi Belaid/AFP]\n\nPolice were also deployed around the parliament, preventing demonstrators from accessing it.\n\nIn Tunis on Sunday, police used pepper spray against protesters who threw stones and shouted slogans demanding that Prime Minister Mechichi quit and parliament be dissolved.\n\nWitnesses said protesters stormed or tried to storm the offices of Ennahdha in Monastir, Sfax, El Kef and Sousse, while in Tozeur they set fire to the party\u2019s local headquarters.\n\nEnnahdha, banned before the revolution, has been the most consistently successful party since 2011 and a member of successive coalition governments.\n\nThe sacking of Tunisia\u2019s parliament is the latest step along a bumpy road since the country\u2019s 2011 revolution.",

          "text": "China came out swinging at high-level face-to-face talks with the United States on Monday, blaming the U.S. for a \u201cstalemate\u201d in bilateral relations and calling on America to change \u201cits highly misguided mindset and dangerous policy.\u201d\n\nVice Foreign Minister Xie Feng accused the administration of President Joe Biden of trying to contain and suppress China\u2019s development, according to an official summary of his remarks to visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman.\n\nThe fundamental reason why relations between the two face serious difficulties is because some Americans portray China as an \u201cimagined enemy,\u201d the Foreign Ministry quoted Xie as saying.\n\nSherman, America\u2019s No. 2 diplomat, is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China since Biden took office six months ago. She was having separate meetings with Xie, who is in charge of U.S.-China relations, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a closed-off resort hotel in the city of Tianjin.\n\nRelations between the countries deteriorated sharply under Biden\u2019s predecessor, Donald Trump, and the two sides remain at odds over a host of issues including technology, cybersecurity, human rights and other issues.\n\nXie said China wants to seek common ground while shelving differences. The Biden administration has said it will cooperate in some areas but confront China in others, such as human rights, describing the relationship as collaborative, competitive and adversarial.\n\nIn an interview Saturday, Wang accused the U.S. of adopting a superior attitude and using its strength to pressure other countries.\n\n\u201cChina would never accept any country that claims to be superior to others,\u201d he told China\u2019s Phoenix Television. \u201cIf the U.S. has not learned to treat other countries equally, China and the international community have the responsibility to help the U.S. learn how to do this.\u201d\n\nBiden administration officials have said the goal of the talks is not to negotiate specific issues but to keep high-level communications channels open. The U.S. wants to ensure that guardrails are in place to prevent competition between the countries from becoming conflict, they said.\n\nA possible meeting between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to be on the agenda, possibly on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Rome at the end of October.\n\nSherman, who arrived Sunday evening from Mongolia, tweeted \u201cheartfelt condolences (from the United States) to those who have lost loved ones\u201d in severe storms and flooding last week that killed at least 63 people in Henan province.\n\nHer meetings follow an initial and highly contentious meeting in March in Anchorage, Alaska, where Wang and veteran Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi flew to meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nJohn Kerry, the Biden administration\u2019s special climate envoy, traveled to Shanghai for meetings with his Chinese counterpart in April.",

          "text": "The US is heading \u201cin the wrong direction\u201d on the coronavirus pandemic as infections surge among the unvaccinated, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert has warned.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci said the Delta variant of Covid-19 was driving the spike in areas with low vaccination rates.\n\nHe said health officials were considering revising mask guidance for vaccinated Americans to curb cases.\n\nOffering booster jabs to vulnerable people was also under review, he said.\n\nThe coronavirus situation in the US is becoming \u201ca pandemic among the unvaccinated\u201d, Dr Fauci, the chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told broadcaster CNN on Sunday.\n\nMore than 162.7 million people \u2013 or 49% of the population \u2013 have been fully vaccinated in the US, official data shows.\n\nThe US had been a world leader in jab uptake until April, when vaccination rates started to drop off.\n\nVaccination rates are particularly low in southern states, where fewer than half of residents have received their first dose in some cases.\n\nMeanwhile, daily coronavirus infections are on the rise again after numbers fell in May and June.\n\nThe resurgence has added to the more than 34 million cases and 610,000 deaths recorded so far in the US.\n\nThe trend has been attributed, in part, to the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Covid.\n\nThe sharpest increases in Covid cases are in states with lower vaccination rates, such as Florida, Texas and Missouri.\n\nEarlier this week, US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said 99.5% of Covid deaths were occurring among unvaccinated people.\n\nIn his interview with CNN, Dr Fauci said local leaders in areas with low vaccination rates needed to do more to encourage people to get jabbed.\n\nHe said he was \u201cvery heartened to hear\u201d the Republican governors of Arkansas and Florida promoting vaccinations in their states. Both leaders have been critical of Dr Fauci\u2019s advice in the past.\n\nDr Fauci has been a key adviser to President Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, through the pandemic.\n\nHe said he was involved in discussions to change mask guidance issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAs it stands, the CDC says people who are fully vaccinated can \u201cresume activities that you did before the pandemic without wearing a mask\u201d.\n\nDr Fauci said local governments could issue their own rules under the current CDC guidance.\n\nBut he noted that some local governments had reinstated indoor and public mask requirements to curb rising infections.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, masks are now required indoors for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.",
