          "title": "Appointment, promotion and remuneration of judges in Nigeria: The need for a change",
          "text": "Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, JUSUN\n\nBy Aare Afe Babalola, OFR, CON, SAN\n\nAs the strike action called by JUSUN entered its eight week and following reported breakthrough between the Union and State governments in talks aimed at ending the said strike, it is imperative to comment on some paramount issues affecting the Nigerian judiciary, particularly with regards to the appointment, remuneration and promotion of Judges.\n\nThe Appointment of Judicial Officers\n\nIn the sixties when I began the practice of Law, appointment to the Bench was strictly on merit. At that time, appointments were by invitation, after, at least, 10 years in practice. Sitting Judges were always quick to identify legal practitioners who possessed sterling qualities suitable for appointment to the Bench.\n\nAside from sound knowledge of the law, integrity and honour marked out and propelled many Judges appointed in those days to the Bench. However, this was made possible by the 1963 Constitution which was in force at the time. Under this Constitution, the procedure for the appointment of the Justices of the Supreme Court, as well as a Judge of the High Court of Lagos, are similar \u2013 the President appoints, acting on the advice or recommendation of the Prime Minister. Though this procedure seems simple, it was yet effective and notorious for producing the most qualified and best-suited judges on the Bench.\n\nThis system effectively obviated a recourse to political affiliation, nepotism or favouritism in the appointment of judges which, no doubt, has characterised the appointment mechanism today. Undoubtedly, the provision of the 1999 Constitution as to the appointment of Judges and Justices deeply encourages the politicisation of this hallowed position.\n\nA Justice of the Supreme Court now has to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council, subject to the confirmation of such appointment by the Senate; thereby making the process more politically inclined and easier to manipulate to suit the whims and caprices of the political class.\n\nComparatively, in some states in the United States of America, the appointment of judges is not totally in the hands of either the Governor or the legislature, but in the hands of the electorates. For instance, in Pennsylvania, an election was held on May 18, 2021 whereby judicial hopefuls were elected into office through partisan, state-wide elections, rather than being selected on merit by the Judicial Commission, or by the governor or legislature.\n\nAt the moment, appointment to the Nigerian Bench is seen by many as an easy way out from the demands of private law practice. Some even aspire to the Bench to enjoy the perquisites of judicial office without giving adequate thought to the demands and responsibilities of the position. It is for this reason that I advocate for the appointment of judicial officers from Senior Advocates of Nigeria, just like in the United Kingdom where members of the Queen\u2019s Counsel may be appointed as judicial officers.\n\nThis reminds me of Mrs.Safiya Badamasi Umar of Katsina State who was conferred the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria in 2019, and was sworn in as a Judge of the Katsina State High Court in 2020. The Nigerian Judiciary certainly needs more judges to be appointed from Senior Advocates. However, for this to be so, there needs to be the conferment of more Senior Advocates and, in addition, more has to be done with regard to the remuneration of judicial officers. I will discuss more on the subject of remuneration shortly.\n\nThe Elevation of Judges into the Higher Bench\n\nIn similar terms, it is time to shift the paradigm of elevation of judges from the official Bar alone. There should be room for the appointment of judges and justices straight from practice to all levels of Courts. This is the practice in England where some distinguished lawyers have been appointed to the Bench. However, this will engender the conferment of the rank of SAN on more legal practitioners and better remuneration for judges to make the position more lucrative.\n\nIn addition, there needs to be a review of the process of appointing High Court Judges from the magistracy. Magistrates should be encouraged to stay at the Lower Bench and not necessarily seek elevation to the High Court. This will create a whole lot of stability in the appointment, retention, and performance of Magistrates in Ekiti State. However, there is a need to increase the salaries and entitlements of magistrates in order to make the position more lucrative; and, of course, to ensure that their entitlements are promptly paid.\n\nGenerally, the age of appointment of judges in Nigeria calls for great concern. It is not only economically counterproductive but equally unreasonable to appoint judges who are close to the official age of retirement. There is no point in waiting till a person has attained the age of 55 before appointing him to the Bench. Younger Judges should be appointed in order to spend more years on the Bench and to allow that they develop the requisite skills and knowledge which will permit them to have longer, more productive years on the Bench.\n\nRemuneration of Judges\n\nRemuneration and employment condition of judicial officers, as we may know, is nothing to write home about. To put this in proper perspective, I will consider the position in South Africa.\n\nALSO READ: Ketron Investment Limited acquires Shoprite Nigeria\n\nThe South African legislature enacted a Judges\u2019 Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act. Under this law, South African High Court, Constitutional Court and Supreme Court of Appeal judges have a 15-year tenure and where a judge who has attained the age of 70 years has not yet completed his 15 years\u2019 active service, he must continue to perform active service as a judge till he attains the age of 75 years.\n\nIn addition to ensuring the payment of attractive salaries and benefits to serving judges, there is a provision for continuous payment of salaries and gratuities to judges after discharge from active service. Also, there is a provision for payment of lifetime salaries to surviving spouses of judges, and gratuities for such spouses.\n\nBy way of comparison, the pay of Nigerian Judges compares poorly with their foreign counterparts. At the rate of about N475 to a Dollar, the following table demonstrably shows that Nigerian Judges are the least paid:\n\nIn 2013, the then Lord Chief Justice of England, in his final annual report as Lord Chief Justice, expressed the fear that unless the pay of Judges was raised from its average of \u00a3175,000 (N43,750,000) per year \u2013 at the then exchange rate of N250 to a pound) many top lawyers will reject the opportunity to become Judges. In his report on the matter, the MailOnline in its edition of 31st August 2014 stated as follows:\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s top judge has launched a scathing attack on the decision to slash his colleagues\u2019 pay, warning it has destroyed morale in the profession and risks compromising the quality of future recruits. Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, who is standing down from the role later this year, says sweeping salary cuts of as much as 60 per cent since 2011, allied to an increased workload, is seriously affecting judges\u2019 state of mind.\n\nAnd he fears that unless pay is raised from its current average of \u00a3175,000 per year, top lawyers will reject the chance to become judges. In his final annual report, he said there was a growing gap between senior lawyers\u2019 pay and that of Judges. Judges are also working harder, he said, no longer presiding over trials and hearings, but also involved in administrative and other duties. This combination of changes has lowered morale, which raised doubts about the ability to \u2018recruit, retain and motivate sufficient high-quality people to the judiciary\u2019.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the fact that appointments of High Court Judges are made by the Governor upon the recommendation of the National Judicial Council is one capable of abuse and therefore further eroding the independence of the Judiciary. From the clear wordings of Section 271 of the Constitution, the appointment of judges is made by the Governor. All that the National Judicial Council does is to recommend based on factors such as vacancies and suitability of candidates. Where the Governor proceeds to make the appointment based upon the recommendation of the Council, the appointee may feel a sense of loyalty to the Governor who appointed him.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear, from the foregoing, that the time is ripe for a departure from the old way of doing things. In order to ensure a corruption-free, well-motivated, and justice-driven court system, a whole lot has to be done to reform the judiciary in its entirety. Government must particularly act in a manner that suggests it is serious about independence of the judiciary. A situation in which the judicial arm of government yearly gets pittance in terms of budgetary allocation is not one that will portray government in good light.\n\nGovernment may be perceived as punishing the judiciary for any perceived wrong doing and this will never augur well for the polity.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "A look at Buhari\u2019s hailers and his haters",
          "text": "By Rotimi Fasan\n\nLast Saturday, May 29, makes it exactly six years since President Muhammadu Buhari first took the oath of office during an elaborate ceremony at the Eagles Square, in Abuja, the country\u2019s capital.\n\nIt was his first four-year term as president. Since that first oath-taking ceremony, the President has had to take the oath of office one more time for a second four-year term that started in May of 2019. At this point of his presidency, Buhari has spent more than two-thirds of his presidential terms. It is, therefore, an appropriate time as any for Nigerians to appraise his performance.\n\nLong before now, the Buhari scoresheet as president has been a subject of animated, often-polarising, debates. Yes, even before Buhari\u2019s multiple bids for the presidency, long after his unceremonious ouster as the head of a junta that sacked the Second Republic, met with success at the fourth attempt, his suitability or otherwise as president has been the subject of acrimonious arguments.\n\nALSO READ: Freight forwarders, PTML agrees on review of charges by 50 percent\n\nNo sooner was he sworn-in than his performance or lack of performance became the basis of mudslinging that has shown no sign of abating even six years after. Events of the last two years, specifically the state of (in)security, be it social, economic or political, with terrorists of various shades, insurgents and bandits, running amok; mass loss of jobs and two-digit inflationary rise, and the future of Nigeria as a political entity being constantly put in question, the role of Muhammadu Buhari as either a performing or non-performing president has again come under sharp focus, ever more stridently.\n\nThus, on this occasion of the sixth anniversary of his administration, it was again time for both the praise singers and dirge masters to roll out the drums, respectively to celebrate or mourn. But this was not an activity that the arm of the Buhari administration now infamously known as \u2018\u2019the Presidency\u201d was going to leave to outsiders alone.\n\nOne of the duo of presidential media aides, Femi Adesina, was quick to roll out the drums. But unlike in the past when the songs from Adesina had been unmitigatedly upbeat, he was on this occasion prepared for a nuanced, even if still-gushy appraisal. He conceded in the opening remark of his somewhat starkly long and boring release, that the economic, social and security situation of the country has been very challenging.\n\nAs would be expected of a paid mouthpiece on a public relations assignment, Adesina did not dwell in any relative detail on the specifics of the challenging circumstances he wrote about in broad, generalising strokes, before quickly moving on to highlight in very elaborate terms that did nothing to sustain the reader\u2019s interest, due to the boring officialese in which it was written, what he would later call \u201cteeny-weeny bits of what the Buhari government has done in these spheres of national life\u2019\u2019.\n\nAdesina offered very generous appraisal of his principal\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s infrastructural sector, celebrating railways and road constructions, a number of which he says are already slated for inauguration by the President, from the South-West, through the South-East, South-South and the North-Central to the North-West and North-East. On the economic front, he celebrated the different poverty alleviation programmes of the Buhari government. The administration\u2019s effort in the agro-allied sector is not left out. In all, Adesina gave his principal a resounding pass mark reminding those who care to know that there are yet more \u2018\u2019wonders\u2019\u2019 waiting to be performed by the Buhari administration.\n\nFor the sake of Nigeria, I would want to believe Adesina and, therefore, look forward to those wonders that the administration will perform that it could not convincingly perform in the previous six years. The problem of this present administration is not so much that it has lost much of the goodwill it enjoyed at the beginning as that it is determined to live in the bubble of the alternative reality it has created for itself no matter what the facts on the ground say.\n\nThat should not be surprising about an administration that has been hijacked by interlopers who, in the guise of \u201cthe presidency\u201d, now speak, take decisions and act in the name of the President. Even when the President must be held accountable for all that goes on in his administration, there is no doubt that a clique, perhaps, a triumvirate that includes Abubakar Malami, Garba Shehu, and Sabiu Yusuf/Mamman Daura, are largely responsible for those contentious decisions that have brought the country to the brink of separation.\n\nALSO READ: Kwara administers 2nd jab of COVID-19 vaccine\n\nGarba Shehu too has been defending the indefensible in the name of celebrating the achievement of the administration whose history he is doing only next to Malami to write in infamy. The important thing to note here about the hailers and haters of Buhari is that they all operate in absolute terms. While for the hailers it is all rankadede, as with them Buhari cannot set a foot wrong, for the haters, it is mostly bamuso, nothing Buhari does, no matter how useful, can be good. Which then makes both the hailers and the haters who cut across ethnic, religious, professional, and educational divides, undesirable anachronisms unfit and unable to make objective assessments of the Nigerian situation under Buhari.\n\nBut what this country needs are citizens, women and men, young and old, who can see things and people in terms of their own merit, people without fixed, apriori allegiance to any position, individual or group. When they see what is right or wrong, they say so within human limitations, no matter what the stakes are. That they supported a Buhari policy today does not mean they should support it tomorrow if there is no reason to.\n\nThat they were fervent supporters of Buhari over Goodluck Jonathan in 2015, does not mean they should remain Buhari\u2019s supporters forever even when evidence shows he has performed less than even he promised to. Where such citizens exist, they would be able to examine the Buhari administration in terms of what it has got wrong in the context of present concerns. Indeed, a full account of the Buhari administration will only be possible after the administration has taken its exit.\n\nUntil it does, however, honest Nigerians should not be afraid to say that in six years the Buhari administration has accentuated the fault lines of our fragile nationhood more than any other administration in recent memory. No government before this present one practiced nepotism to the level the Buhari administration has now taken it. Nor has the general decline in security been this bad in peacetime Nigeria. The economy itself has been ailing well before COVID-19. These are the facts of a national malaise that is not inevitable. To see this and remain silent is to be unpatriotic.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The recent rollout of mass metering by the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) has failed to provide the needed relief from estimated bills, and has rather compounded huge problems for customers, DAILY POST investigation has revealed.\n\nFor some residents, the rollout was welcomed with open arm, however, the relief was for only a moment as staff of AEDC are giving meters with existing liabilities (debt) to new customers.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that staff of the electricity company are diverting meters meant for some customers and selling same to others, with these meters having the liabilities of the actual owners.\n\nNational Mass Metering Programme: Anger as Osun residents complain of extortion\n\nBack in November 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari had announced plans to distribute 1 million free prepaid meters to Nigerians, as part of the Federal government agreement with the NLC over the fuel subsidy and electricity tariff hike.\n\nIn January 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) disbursed N14.35 billion to DisCos to cover the procurement of 263,860 meters under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP).\n\nAccording to the breakdown, AEDC got approved meters allocation of 101,186 units (10.1%).\n\nConsumers who spoke with DAILY POST expressed disappointment with the programme. A resident at Asokoro Extension in Abuja said staff of the AEDC are committing fraud.\n\nGroup lament IBEDC\u2019s failure to meter customers\u2019 houses\n\nFor fear of retaliation, the customer preferred not to be named.\n\n\u201cMy landlord applied for 6 meters for my compound, he paid about 400 thousand. In January, we got one. When we tried to buy units on the meter, about 25 per cent was deducted for \u2018existing liability\u2019. It was surprising for us because we have no existing liability. The previous month before they brought the meter, they gave us a huge bill of 34,000, which we cleared. When we contacted AEDC, we were told we have 48,000 liability.\n\n\u201cThe most painful part is that we have even sent a mail to NERC, nothing has happened. Now, they have brought more prepaid meters, all of them are having existing debt on them.\u201d\n\nDAILY POAT also examined 10 meters in the neighbourhood with similar complaints. Most have resigned to their fate.\n\nAnother customer, Abdullahi Garba lamented the activities of the AEDC.\n\n\u201cIn this compound, we have a meter on band A, we have another on band B and others on band C. Despite charging us for band A, but we don\u2019t get light up to 12 hours daily. The level of fraud going on over there is mind-blowing. I have written several letters to the AEDC, yet, they have not resolved it. This is fraud.\n\n\u201cThere is a great level of inequality with the light, why charge us for Band A, but give us Band C light?.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will have to go to the NERC forum to complain. What is the essence of privatization where we are treated as though they are doing us a favour?\u201d\n\nDAILY POST made effort to get reactions from AEDC. Details of the meters were sent to the General Manager Corporate Communications of the AEDC, Fadipe Oyebode, however, responses have been slow.\n\nAuto reclosure on 33KVA\n\nConsumers in Kubwa/Dutse, Ushafa and Bwari and some satellite towns outside Abuja are also getting the short end of the deal from AEDC. Despite being within the 33 KVA infrastructure, an auto reclosure has been fixed on the transmission to regulate power supply to the area as the people hardly get up to 6 hours of power supply in a day. DAILY POST recalls that the government is against placing auto reclosure on transmission lines and regards such act as illegal.\n\nAuto reclosing is a phenomenon in which the breaker tries to reconnect the line between two points with the delay or without delay. In this case, the essence is to delay in order to minimize cost of maintenance as well as running cost, DAILY POST gathered.\n\nA source told DAILY POST that it is difficult to understand why AEDC that is interested in generating funds be auto reclosing a 33KVA power line.\n\nReacting to the predicament of the people of Kubwa/Dutse, Ushafa/Bwari, Mr Fadipe said even the 33 KVA cannot guarantee interruptions.\n\n\u201cThat one is not strange, generation has dropped. There is no consumer in this country that does not suffer one form of interruption or another. That is the common thing, even if you are on 33 KVA, you will still suffer some form of interruptions.\n\n\u201cThe point is, that they are on 33 KVA does not mean they will have light for 24/7. We don\u2019t have that luxury, but they can enjoy more than the rest.\u201d\n\nBut an insider source said the problem of the aforementioned areas is the auto reclosure placed on them.\n\nReps investigation\n\nOn the 20th of May, the House of Representatives mandated its committee on power to investigate the transfer of liabilities from old customers to new ones.\n\nThis development followed an adopted motion wherein the committee was mandated to investigate.\n\nFor those affected, the investigation and prompt resolution would be timely.\n\nTCN finally restores power to Kaduna",

So, in principle, every human being has the right to defend himself or herself. But the practice of that needs to be examine thoroughly before putting it to use.\u201d\n\nThe clergy also chided those criticising the church for speaking about issues relating to governance, explaining that \u201cthe church has the moral authority that it uses in interfacing with the people and the word of God being the basis for such interaction.\n\n\u201cThe church will continue to awaken the conscience of the people of our nation on the values that are necessary for the common good, the church will assist in teaching the people about issues concerning love for one another. If we stick to the teaching, the society will be good for it.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the current mood of the nation does not call for celebration, but for sober reflection.\n\nCiting a Biblical verse: \u201cGive to Caesar, that which is Caesar\u2019s and to God that which is God\u2019s,\u201d he said if people\u2019s aspirations were largely met, there would be less crisis in the society.\n\n\u201cWhen the people enter into a social contract with the state, there are obligations and responsibilities on both parties to strike an equilibrium in the pact.\n\n\u201cThe people owe the country their civic duties while the country owes the people provision of services to retain their trust and for a better society.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, those salient conventions have taken flight from our polity and thereby paved the way for mistrust, corruption and banditry.\n\n\u201cIt is callous for a human being to take another person\u2019s life while the country, under whose control it is to check such inhumanity, appears helpless.\n\n\u201cFrom the North to the South, every part of the country is witnessing one form of brigandage or the other,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Zika Bobby\n\nDiaspora Igbo group, the Igbo World Assembly (IWA), has said there was need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions.\n\nIt condemned Federal Government\u2019s shoot-on-sight position, noting that such could be termed an act of ethnic cleaning.\n\nIWA Chairman, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, who stated this in a keynote address in Abuja at the just-concluded 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-ethnic Peace Dialogue, said true fiscal federalism was needed in Nigeria to address issues affecting the country.\n\nRestructuring of Nigeria, according to him, should be a means of tackling the worsening security situation and the agitation for secession.\n\n\u201cWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fairplay, balance and equal access to political power for the good of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIWA feels that what Nigeria needs on the long run is true fiscal federalism which is a system of government based on democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and regional/state governments. The individual federating units need to have more control over their affairs.\n\n\u201cThe regional government should control their resources and pay a percentage royalty tax to the Federal Government. The Federal Government should control issues in the single exclusive list such as military or foreign policy. We should return to agricultural businesses such as was practiced in the sixties by our former leaders. There is a need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions or zones.\u201d\n\nWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fair play, balance and equal access to political power for the good of Nigerians,\u201d Anakwenze said.\n\nHe said a future Nigeria requires respect for our constitution and rule of law, respect for human rights and civil rights, respect for the federal character commission rules from 1979 constitution, implementation of restructuring, regionalisation and devolution of powers, merit-based appointment to government positions, firm knowledge and competent management of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nAnakwenze said detribalised appointments and leadership in all sectors of the government, equal and equitable treatment of all Nigerian regardless of tribes of origins or religion, elimination of ethnic cleansing in the Nigerian political space, free and fair electoral process, a government that unites all Nigerians and not one that is divisive, were needed now.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, if we cannot work this out quickly, a referendum might be needed so that all the major Nigerian groups can go their separate ways,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the group position about presidency of Nigeria of South East extraction, he said: \u201cWe ask that all political parties should zone Nigerian presidency to South East in 2023. And efforts should be geared to achieving that goal. IWA states only restructuring can prevent Nigeria from disintegration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Fulani herdsmen, he said Ndigbo will no longer tolerate the attack by herdsmen.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about that because the well-being of our people is involved. We will no longer accept this condition and we are going to talk to our people on what to do about it.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs to prepare to defend themselves and his family against the herdsmen because we are not prepared to cede an inch of Igbo land to anybody because our land is very small.\n\n\u201cOur people must protect their crops always. If any animal comes to eat the crops, it means hunger will be in the land because that is what the people use after harvesting and sales to train their children or pay for hospital bills.\n\n\u201cIf the herders kill our people and destroy our things, we have the right to reciprocate. We want peace for us and for everybody, but if somebody comes to fight us on our land, we will fight back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended southern governors on their decision to ban open grazing in the region.",

So, for him to have been murdered in the manner they did, a retired AIG gunned down, is very sad,\u201d Ortom stated.\n\nHe decried the increasing spate of insecurity that has bedevilled the North East, North West and North Central, South South, South East, South West, and called on security agencies to find the killers of his aide.\n\nThe governor, who sympathised with the family, friends and former colleagues of the deceased, prayed to God to grant him eternal rest.\n\nMeanwhile, the Plateau state police command said it has arrested some suspected killers of Dega.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Gabriel Ubah, in a statement, yesterday, said: \u201cThe Plateau State Police Command, on a sad note, received an ugly report of the death of AIG Christopher Dega (retd).\n\nOn 31/05/2021, at about 2030hrs, AIG Christopher Dega was shot dead by three yet to be identified gunmen, in an isolated restaurant at Bukuru, Jos.\n\n\u201cFrom the investigation, so far, it appeared that he was trailed and shot.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the establishment of oxygen production plant in each of the 36 states of the country. The project would cost an estimated N5.6 billion.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who briefed on behalf of Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, at the end of the FEC meeting said the approval was to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic, which had made oxygen a very critical commodity.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Health presented a memo, which was approved, for the emergency supply, installation and maintenance of oxygen production plants and construction of plant houses in each of the 36 States of the federation and Abuja. The contract was approved in the sum of N5, 615, 127, 479 inclusive of 7.5 per cent VAT, in favour of four different companies, with a completion period of 20 weeks.\u201d\n\nThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) had on Monday announced that, in case of a third wave of COVID-19, increased oxygen reserve capacity would be one of its three areas of focus.\n\nMohammed said council also approved the sum of N9.2 billion as premium for insurance companies to manage group life insurance for federal civil servants, para military and intelligence community for the year 2021-2022.\n\n\u201cThis premium is for a period of 12 months. This is part of the government\u2019s welfare programme for our public employees so that in case of death, they are assured that there would be compensation.\u201d\n\nThe minister said council also approved N18.1 billion for the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, for the development of infrastructure and Kano and Calabar Free Trade Zones, as well as the Textile and Garment Park in Lagos and the Special Economic Zone in Lekki, Lagos.\n\nMohammed said the approval was of critical importance to the infrastructure development plan of the country.\n\nThe minister added that council also approved the sum of N1. 1 billion for the procurement of aviation security uniforms and accessories for use in various airports across the country.\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs also got an approval of N864.7 million for two road contracts that were abandoned by previous administrations.\n\nHe listed the projects as Okpula-Igwartanta Phase I linking Imo and Rivers State started in 2010 which got approval for a variation of N620, 763, 000., and erosion flood control on Ndemili-Utagba-Onitsha road in Delta State started in 2014, which got approved N244 million to augment the original contract sum.\n\nEnvironment Minister, Mahammad Mahmud, said council approved the revised national policy on climate change. He said \u201cthe last one was in 2012 and it became necessary for us to revise based on what has been happening in the last three years since 2012 particularly with the various agreements.\n\n\u201cWe all know climate change is our topic of today, it has serious implications on economy, livelihoods. The environment in general and economic change affect every body but we have realised that it affects women even more and on this, we also know that we have national polIcy on gender and climate change as approved. This revised one has also put into consideration the national policy on gender and climate change to include women in almost every aspect of climate projects executions.\u201d",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Okwe Obi, Abuja Abuja and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nApplause and condemnations, yesterday, trailed Twitters decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s civil war tweet.\n\nIn the tweet shared on Tuesday, Buhari spoke about the civil war experience and threatened to deal with those \u201cbent on destroying\u201d Nigeria through \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\n\nBuhari had in series of tweet on Tuesday via is verified Twitter handle @MBuhari tweeted: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nTwitter rules prohibit a number of actions from users, including violence, abuse and hateful conduct.\n\nFollowing several complaints, Twitter deleted the tweet, stating: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, accused Twitter of double standard. He said while the social media giant had conveniently ignored inciting tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and his cohorts, displaying the same biases it did during the EndSARS protest last year, where government and private properties were looted and set on fire but finds Buhari\u2019s tweet offensive.\n\nHe alleged Twitter\u2019s role is suspect and Nigeria would not be fooled.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, Buhari\u2019s comment cannot be compared to the directive by Kanu to his followers to kill soldiers, policemen and burn down government facilities.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the EndSARS protests that was funding EndSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of former president of US, Trump. And you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during EndSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\n\n\u201cYou see, we are not going to be be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police offices, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences, is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nHowever, Former President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike and former second vice president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Monday Onyekachi Ubani and others hailed Twitters.\n\nUbani described Buhari\u2019s tweet as hate language.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the tweet has been pulled down shows that some of us who said it was wrong of the president to threaten his citizens are justified in our position. I saw that tweet as sensational especially as he was talking to his children and said he will unleash a language they will understand; that is hate language and I\u2019m happy that it has been deleted. What the president needs to do is to say I didn\u2019t mean it. What we need now is to call for a truce and listen to what the people are saying; threats will not solve our problem.\u201d\n\nAdeolu Ogunbanjo, national president, National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS) said: \u201cI see his (Buhari) choice of words offensive to the younger generation and obviously it is a threat because his words were too open ended and coming. I think he should calm down and look at what Twitter is saying; that you can\u2019t use their medium to be threatening a whole generation of a country. These people he is threatening are supposed to be the ones in charge.\u201d\n\nJide Awe, chief executive officer of Jidaw Systems Limited said: \u201cThe truth is that all social media big tech platforms are private platforms. My assumption is that such actions are taken when a user\u2019s post is deemed to be against the social media platform\u2019s community guidelines and terms. All users agree to those rules when they sign up. Having social media accounts is a choice.\n\n\u201cIn view of their reach and influence, many world leaders use these platforms to communicate with their citizens and the world. The global response to posts and tweets is a sign of the power of social media platforms. However, they own their private platforms. On their own, these platforms determine when a user breaks the rules and the actions to take when there is a violation.\n\n\u201cFormer US President, Donald Trump had his tweets deleted and received several warnings and \u201cviolation\u201d reports on his tweets before he was eventually banned from Twitter.\u201d\n\nTwitter has also been on fire of the president\u2019s utterance. Former Ekiti governor, Peter Ayodele Fayose, @GovAyoFayose, tweeted: \u201cNigeria is boiling everywhere and all that the president can do is to be threatening genocide up and down? Now that Twitter has dealt with our almighty President Buhari, won\u2019t he \u201cdeal\u201d with Twitter too? Like Trump, like Buhari.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power-madness. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle. Can our president operate android phone not to talk of making genocidal tweets?\n\n\u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lie Mohammad and co accountable.\u201d\n\nSenator Shehu Sani @ShehuSani: \u201cThe President should talk to us\u2026.The President should address us\u2026The President should speak to us\u2026.now una don hear am.\n\nReno Omokri @renoomokri: \u201cLie Mohammed accuses @Twitter and @Jack of sponsoring\n\n@MaziNnamdiKanu: \u201cHow pathetic! When Twitter permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account, Buharists celebrated. Then, Twitter was not sponsoring IPOB. And you are surprised Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria?\n\nDele Momodu Ovation @DeleMomodu: \u201cI had no answer until i saw the video\u2026 it was a sad day for those who still have some modicum of belief in project nigeria. The president did not declare war on bandits and herdsmen but was interested in fighting another civil war, and said so openly. That was an all-time low!!\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the trenchant criticisms, a group, Vanguard for Peace and National Development, backed President Buhari\u2019s vow to crush separatist groups.\n\nIts Executive Director, Mr Ahmed Tijani, in a statement, commended the president for his stance on the agitation\n\nTijani also enjoined the government to probe alleged alliances between some highly placed politicians with managers of various security agencies in the country.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari\u2019s zero tolerance for the activities of proscribed groups was evident in his resolve to ensure Nigeria remains an indivisible entity.\n\nHe said it had become imperative to investigate true identities of some high-ranking security officers and politicians with proscribed groups.\n\n\u201cWe are equally privy to series of secret meetings between some politicians and managers of security outfits in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a group of patriots, we cannot afford to keep mute when these types of issues come up,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nBut Uwazuruike wondered why Buhari has not threatened Boko Haram, kidnappers and bandits, but was quick to threaten peaceful protesters asking for a referendum.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised, the president acted true to type, he has shown his true colour. He was speaking from his heart, he was not reading a speech. His speech manifests his 97 per cent versus 5 per cent stance. Not long ago in Kaduna, Buhari appealed to armed bandits to release kidnapped university students, Mr President has not threatened the bandits, Boko Haram or kidnappers, he has not threatened bandits and kidnappers in his home state of Katsina, but he found it very convenient to threaten unarmed people asking for a referendum. Most people don\u2019t know that what IPOB is asking for is a referendum, not secession. What President Buhari does not understand is that if a referendum is conducted those opposed to IPOB/ESN may be more. I\u2019m not surprised that he is threatening us. I want to let Mr President know that he may defeat the Igbo but he cannot liquidate us.\u201d\n\n\u2022Igbo, Arewa groups fume\n\nLeading Igbo body, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) condemned what it called the president\u2019s penchant for ethnic profiling, stating that his body language has given impetus to allegation that the violence in the South East was being perpetrated by some imported mercenaries to orchestrate military invasion.\n\nA statement by ADF\u2019s spokesman, Chief Abia Onyike, yesterday, expressed disappointment that instead of fishing out the criminals and making them face the law, president Buhari had rushed to threaten the people of the region.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a message of collective annihilation. Why did he not talk like this when Fulani herdsmen killed hundreds of people in the South East and other parts of Nigeria? He should stop his policy of ethnic profiling in order to save us from genocide.\n\n\u201cThere are people who believe that the violence in the South East was imported by mercenaries from outside the zone in order to create an alibi for the military invasion of Igboland. That must be a very wicked plot. Buhari should summon a national conference to restructure/reconstitute Nigeria along the lines of genuine federalism and fiscal federalism.\n\n\u201cWe need autonomy for the regions or federating units. Calling out security agencies to invade Igboland and kill people on the streets is not the solution to the current crisis in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, pan-Arewa Socio-political Organisation, Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), in a statement by Abdul-Azeez Sulaiman, contended that Buhari\u2019s remark was not only empty but unpresidential, adding that the tweet merely amounted to admission of failure and loss of capacity.\n\n\u201cWe find it ridiculous that most parts of the president\u2019s tweet concentrated more attention to infrastructure than on the lives of citizens that are wasted daily with virtually no response from the authorities.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s revelation that most of those involved in the current agitation for secession are those who have not witnessed the 1967 civil war is a vindication of our position that the only reasonable option to ensure a more secure future is for the Igbo to be allowed to have their wish for a Biafran nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the strength of the Igbo agitation rests on youth who are mainly below the ages of 50, with diseased mindsets induced by their forefathers and encouraged by their political, cultural and religious leaders to take up arms against the Nigerian state and Northerners, has rendered the nation\u2019s unity negotiable.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unreasonable for those older Nigerians who are mostly above 70 to insist that the unity of Nigeria is sacrosanct whereas the people executing the dangerous Southeast secession agenda are almost entirely below 50,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Accuses microblogging site of double standards\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut yesterday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen.\n\nI think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Editors express concern over growing insecurity\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\nA former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, yesterday accused sponsors of the ongoing violence in the South-east of plotting to forestall elections in 2023 with the sole aim of thwarting the clamour by the zone to produce the next president.\n\nEzeife, while featuring on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, however, exonerated members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) from the recent killings of police personnel and the torching of public institutions in the zone.\n\nHe spoke hours after the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nEzeife described the insurrection in the South-east as an attempt to provoke indigenes of the South-east.\n\nHe added that their findings showed that those behind the killings and destruction of public institutions such as offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are not Igbo.\n\nHe said: \u201cWho are the people burning INEC\u2019s offices, who are killing the police? There is the impression that some people even within the government are guilty of organising such threat and blaming it on IPOB and ESN.\n\n\u201cNow we know that more than 80 per cent of the people caught by the CCTV are not from the South-east.\n\nWas it a design to blame it on IPOB and ESN? We are learning more now that there is a design to provoke the East.\u201d\n\nHe, however, could not identify the sponsors but suspected that some of them might be in government going by some of the findings by South-east leaders.\n\nHe stated that a South-east governor who had earlier accused IPOB and ESN of executing the attacks had since exonerated the secessionist group.\n\nHe also expressed reservation that the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, could hold the groups responsible for the violence without evidence.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPOB does not have tradition of shedding blood or burning down things. It is not Igbo tradition to shoot police, burn down houses. During the ENDSARS protests, people attributed what was happening in Lagos to some Igbo people and it was later discovered to be untrue.\n\n\u201cThose who are sponsoring this destruction don\u2019t want election; they don\u2019t want president from South-east zone and would even want to scatter the Anambra election and go for emergency situation and appoint someone.\n\n\u201cNigeria should understand what is going on and not jump into conclusion.\u201d\n\nWhile not justifying the activities of IPOB and its leader, Ezeife stated that the federal government by its alleged continued marginalisation of the South-east, is pushing Igbo out of Nigeria.\n\nHe listed some of the injustices the youths are fighting to include the absence of tangible federal government projects in the area as well as the alleged disregard for the principle of federal character in appointments, to the detriment of the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has been working hard pushing the Igbo out of Nigeria. The young men are reacting to what is coming from the federal government. Whether it is project location, we don\u2019t have any in Igboland; whether it is appointment, you don\u2019t find it but if it is retirement, we\u2019re dominant.\u201d\n\nEzeife also alleged that many Igbo businesses are being crippled by the government.\n\nHe dismissed insinuation that the Igbo cannot speak with one voice when it comes to presenting a candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to him, the South-east has many individuals that can govern the country and the zone is currently working hard to win the support of other zones to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nOn the ongoing public hearing to review the constitution, the former governor urged legislators to stop wasting their time and public resources because what the people need now is a new constitution.\n\nEditors Express Concern over Growing Insecurity\n\nMeanwhile, the NGE has expressed concern over the growing insecurity in the country and advised government at all levels to activate their structures in tackling the challenges.\n\nIt also called for an enabling political and economic environment for the media to discharge their constitutional and social responsibilities.\n\nIt added that creating a conducive environment for the media to thrive would guarantee and sustain democratic space, sustainable development and provide incentives for social/democratic change.\n\nThe guild, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its President, Mr. Mustapha Isah, and General Secretary, Mr. Iyobosa Uwugiaren, at the end of its 2021 Biennial Convention in Kano, called on the federal government to, as a matter of urgency, expunge, repeal or amend as may be appropriate, all existing obnoxious media laws that are inimical to press freedom.\n\nIt also urged editors and journalists to continue to subscribe to and uphold the journalism code of ethics \u2013 as developed by the Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO).\n\n\u2018\u2019The guild observes the need for the Nigerian mass media to exercise their freedom to operate freely with a sense of responsibility. And considering the spikes in the levels of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, it is high time for the media to set the agenda and lead the country\u2019s drive to sustaining national cohesion.\n\n\u2018\u2019While observing Nigeria\u2019s consistent deterioration in the Global Press Freedom Index since 2005, the guild notes that it is worrisome that the slide is happening in a democracy, whereby the guild has had cause in recent times to issue three press statements on the threats of closure and imposition of fines on some broadcast stations by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC),\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 added.\n\nThe guild noted that the huge disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has created globally, saying that the disruption has also had negative effects on the Nigerian media industry, leading to drop in revenues.\n\n\u2018\u2019For the media to respond to these challenges creatively, there is urgent need for the media managers to evolve diversification, designing of a dynamic management system, producing innovative contents, restructuring their production technologies and adapting new funding and business models.\n\n\u2018\u2019Considering that the role of information dissemination by the mass media is an essential public and social service, the guild calls on government to consider mitigating the media\u2019s operational costs and economic challenges by floating a national media subsidy regime, including tax holidays and waivers, lifting of licence fees for the broadcast media and offsetting debts of government media agencies in the country,\u2019\u2019 the guild stated.\n\nThe guild\u2019s national convention, which attracted over 300 editors and media owners across the country, also expressed concern over the prevalence and massive elevation of fake news, disinformation and propaganda due to the mishandlings of the social media platforms by negative persons.\n\nThe guild harped on the need for Nigeria\u2019s media publics, particularly the youth whom the media must carry along, to use, decipher and rely on the conventional media for reliable and credible information in taking their decisions.\n\nThe safety of journalists also attracted the attention of the editors, as they called on both the public and the private media operators to devise measures inclusive of guaranteed welfare and insurance schemes for the safety and security of journalists working for them.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 added: \u2018\u2019Against the backdrop of the assailing new media trends, the guild highlights the essence of training and retraining of the Nigerian journalists to update their knowledge, skills and expertise of the profession \u2013 with a view to attaining the needed proficiency and competencies that are required to overcome the new media drifts that dragging journalism profession.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile commending Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State for keeping the state safe even in the midst of the prevailing insecurity in some parts of the country, the editors also appreciated the state government\u2019s phenomenal drive of infrastructure development; as well as the state government\u2019s determination to turn Kano into a modern city.\n\nThe guild thanked Ganduje and members of the state Executive Council for providing the enabling environment for the national convention to hold.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Barkindo: Oil industry\u2019s upstream spending slumped 30% in 2020\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that the Nigerian oil and gas industry will require at least $40 billion in direct investments in basic infrastructure to achieve the federal government\u2019s much talked-about about \u201cDecade of Gas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said the cartel\u2019s latest assessment showed that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nNNPC said yesterday that it was targeting between 7.4 billion cubic feet to 10 billion cubit feet of gas in the next couple of years, compared to its current 1.6 bcf supply capacity.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual forum organised by the Association of Local Distributors of Gas (ALDG), tagged \u201cThe Decade of Gas: Unlocking Opportunities in the Domestic Gas Market,\u201d the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr Yusuf Usman, stated that a major constraint in achieving local content through the programme is the difficult conditions placed by foreign lenders.\n\nHowever, he stated that the corporation expects to grow about 10 gas-based industries as it works towards the 10-year target.\n\nHe added that the figure on the quantum of funds needed is based on the submissions NNPC has received from potential investors.\n\nIn addition, he stated that about 39 thermal power plants were being targeted as opposed to the current 33.\n\nAccording to him, by the end of this year, the NNPC is projecting an added gas sales of about 600 mmscfd, compared to its current 1.6 bcf to hit 2.2 bcf by the end of 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn terms of benefits, we will generate 45,000 megawatts of power in terms of gas use, creating massive employment and import substitution.\n\n\u201cThere are changes we need to look at to actualise the decade of gas. We see the huge amount of investment, both Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) that will come into the country upward of $40 billion or much more than that in order to achieve all the aggressive plans that that are outlined in the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cThis investment will come in the upstream, midstream and downstream, but there are challenges as well because there have been a lot of announcements around funding for fossil fuels and these are some of the things we have to look at as we go forward and we need to figure out the announcement vis-a-vis the foreign estimate that we expect.\u201d\n\nHe added that the corporation has a supply plan to deliver up to 4.5 bcf of gas into the market, while going forward, the country expects 7.4 bcf of gas.\n\nAccording to Usman, there are urgent plans to complete ongoing gas projects in the country, including the AKK project , which he described as one of the most aggressive and biggest pipeline infrastructure ever embarked upon by the country. The pipeline spans 614 km.\n\nHe said all the gas activities going on around the country were being handled by local construction companies and local providers of services due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into 10 years, we expect to do another big pipeline that will take up gas from south, all the way into Ajaokuta and possibly we extend it all the way to Maiduguri,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be passed this year, noting that the corporation is ready to adjust to the changes that the law will impose.\n\nUsman stated that by the corporation\u2019s projection, demand for gas to generate electricity in the country will consume between 60 to 70 per cent of the entire commodity produced, with the ongoing plan to generate 45,000MW.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge we have is the liquidity in the power sector, and there\u2019s a lot of work going on because it is a very huge market. If you see the demand projections that we have done, it is going to consume 60 to 70 per cent of the gas that we have.\n\n\u201cNot only that; without power, all the development programmes we are thinking of will be a mirage. It is an inevitable equation that we have to solve to move towards development and issues around it have to be resolved,\u201d he stated.\n\nUsman urged policy makers to answer the questions surrounding gas pricing, since Nigeria is interested in using gas as a source of revenue as well as balancing between investment and local content drive.\n\n\u201cAll these FDI come with conditionality before taking the money. That will put a limit to our local content drive. As you all know, the restrictions by itself affect the kind of projections that we look at,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that if Nigeria will achieve the decade of gas, it must transit to a willing-buyer willing-seller market.\n\nBesides, there must be a document with timelines as well as defined investment strategies on the announcement that is being made about the restriction for fossil fuel to achieve the decade of gas.\n\nBarkindo: Oil Industry\u2019s Upstream Spending Slumped 30% in 2020\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, has said that the cartel\u2019s latest assessment shows that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said at the first meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue that despite that, crude oil will continue to be relevant, especially in Africa.\n\nDescribing the future of Africa\u2019s oil industry as bright and the opportunities vast, Barkindo stated that the continent is currently home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world.\n\nAccording to him, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28 per cent of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25 per cent and coal at roughly 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Barkindo stated that the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around nine per cent of world\u2019s output.\n\nHe said at the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 126 billion barrels,with Nigeria holding the lion\u2019s share with 36.9 billion barrels, representing 29 per cent of Africa\u2019s reserves.\n\nBarkindo said demand in developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, would be intensified, and all forms of energy would be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy long-term energy requirements.\n\n\u201cOne major issue looming in the long-term horizon is the lack of adequate industry investment.\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest assessments, upstream capital spending is estimated to have fallen in 2020 by a staggering 30 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cOur 2020 World Oil Outlook estimates that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to advocate a turnaround in this very upsetting trend. The very future of our industry is at stake,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy needs to ensure future demand is met, adding that policies must change in that regard.\n\nHe stated that another issue of utmost concern in Africa is the scourge of energy poverty, which continues to impact millions across the continent.\n\nCiting OPEC data, Barkindo said an estimated 47 per cent of the population in Sub Saharan Africa had no electricity and approximately 85 per cent of people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.\n\nHe stated that considering the richness of the continent\u2019s resources, both conventional and renewable, this situation is hard to accept.\n\nHe urged all stakeholders to unite on the issues to ensure an equitable distribution of energy that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury but a human right.\n\n\u201cOPEC will continue to work closely with our member countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Registrar of the National Examinations Council (NECO), Professor Godswill Obioma, died on Tuesday in controversial circumstances only one week after the Senate announced it would look into N6.5 billion contracts awarded by the council without due process under his predecessors.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from top sources at the Federal Ministry of Education that the probe had unsettled the past NECO bosses and Obioma was willing to lay bare all the documents, which makes his death all the more suspicious.\n\n\u201cObioma was straightforward and his blunt style was not in the good books of some members of the board of the council, who were also loyalists of some former registrars. Only a week ago, the Senate Committee on Public Accounts said it was going to look into how N6.5 billion contracts were awarded without due process in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe registrar was issued two queries to explain, and he was going to give replies to the National Assembly with evidence of what he knew. There should be investigations around his death. There should be no cover-up,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nObioma was appointed registrar in May 2020, taking over from ex-Registrar, Abubakar Gana. See Also Politics Registrar Of Nigeria's Top Examination Body, NECO, Godswill Obioma Assassinated In Minna\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth, told newsmen that he was murdered by armed men who strangled him to death at their residence in Minna, Niger State.\n\nBut the council and the Niger State Police Command claimed the NECO registrar died after a brief illness.\n\nThe NECO Director of Human Resources, Mustapha Abdul, had said Obioma\u2019s second son confirmed to him that the father died after an illness.\n\n\u201cThis is to formally inform you that my father, Prof. Godswill Obioma, the Registrar/Chief Executive of NECO passed to eternal glory yesterday, May 31, after a brief illness. See Also Corruption EXPOSED: Former Acting NECO Registrar, Gana, In N548m Contract Duplication Scandal\n\n\u201cWe request that you kindly notify the Board, Management and the entire staff of the Council of this development,\u201d it read.\n\nThe police command also stated that Obioma died of natural causes with no mention of any investigation opened into the incident.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun noted that Obioma was rushed to the hospital by his family members where he died. See Also Corruption EXPOSED: How Former NECO Registrar, Gana, Illegally Retained Director Due For Retirement\n\nOn May 24, NECO as stated in the 2017 Audit Report submitted to the Senate Committee on Public Accounts awarded N6.5 billion contracts in 2017 without due process.\n\nThe Office of Auditor General of the Federation had in an earlier report treated by the Senate alleged that the examination body spent N7.2 billion on examination materials in January 2017 without any documents to show for such payments.\n\nAt another session two weeks ago, the upper legislative chamber confronted the NECO Registrar, Obioma, with another damning report of alleged N6.5billion contracts award without due process.",

          "text": "The Registrar of the National Examinations Council (NECO), Professor Godswill Obioma, died on Tuesday in controversial circumstances only one week after the Senate announced it would look into N6.5 billion contracts awarded by the council without due process under his predecessors.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt from top sources at the Federal Ministry of Education that the probe had unsettled the past NECO bosses and Obioma was willing to lay bare all the documents, which makes his death all the more suspicious.\n\n\u201cObioma was straightforward and his blunt style was not in the good books of some members of the board of the council, who were also loyalists of some former registrars. Only a week ago, the Senate Committee on Public Accounts said it was going to look into how N6.5 billion contracts were awarded without due process in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe registrar was issued two queries to explain, and he was going to give replies to the National Assembly with evidence of what he knew. There should be investigations around his death. There should be no cover-up,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nObioma was appointed registrar in May 2020, taking over from ex-Registrar, Abubakar Gana. See Also Politics Registrar Of Nigeria's Top Examination Body, NECO, Godswill Obioma Assassinated In Minna\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth, told newsmen that he was murdered by armed men who strangled him to death at their residence in Minna, Niger State.\n\nBut the council and the Niger State Police Command claimed the NECO registrar died after a brief illness.\n\nThe NECO Director of Human Resources, Mustapha Abdul, had said Obioma\u2019s second son confirmed to him that the father died after an illness.\n\n\u201cThis is to formally inform you that my father, Prof. Godswill Obioma, the Registrar/Chief Executive of NECO passed to eternal glory yesterday, May 31, after a brief illness. See Also Corruption EXPOSED: Former Acting NECO Registrar, Gana, In N548m Contract Duplication Scandal\n\n\u201cWe request that you kindly notify the Board, Management and the entire staff of the Council of this development,\u201d it read.\n\nThe police command also stated that Obioma died of natural causes with no mention of any investigation opened into the incident.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun noted that Obioma was rushed to the hospital by his family members where he died. See Also Corruption EXPOSED: How Former NECO Registrar, Gana, Illegally Retained Director Due For Retirement\n\nOn May 24, NECO as stated in the 2017 Audit Report submitted to the Senate Committee on Public Accounts awarded N6.5 billion contracts in 2017 without due process.\n\nThe Office of Auditor General of the Federation had in an earlier report treated by the Senate alleged that the examination body spent N7.2 billion on examination materials in January 2017 without any documents to show for such payments.\n\nAt another session two weeks ago, the upper legislative chamber confronted the NECO Registrar, Obioma, with another damning report of alleged N6.5billion contracts award without due process.",

          "title": "After Buhari\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d tweet is deleted, Nigerian minister accuses Twitter of suspicious agenda",
          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules.

          "title": "Banks don\u2019t fund African renewable energy startups. So where can founders find money?",
          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Airtel Africa has announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175 million. According to the company, the sale to SBA Communications Corporation and Paradigm Infrastructure Limited would allow it to prioritise its core subscription services.\n\nAirtel Africa will receive approximately $157.5 million of the total amount in the first instalment, which is expected to take place in the second half of the group\u2019s financial year.\n\nA portion of the proceeds would be distributed to the Tanzanian government as part of the terms of the company\u2019s public listing in 2019. The rest is to be used for debt reduction at the group level and investment in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania.\n\nIn 2020, Airtel Africa CEO, Raghunath Mandava, outlined plans to sell approximately 4,500 towers in five countries: Chad, Gabon, Madagascar, Malawi, and Tanzania.\n\nThe move aimed to reduce the company\u2019s $3.5 billion debt and prepare for upcoming bond repayments.\n\nThe telecommunications giant has recorded significant losses in India because of low data prices and high competition among telcos. There is also the considerable cost of the infrastructure associated with running a telecoms business.\n\nHowever, there is a growing trend of asset-light telcos focused on core network and services provisions like calls and data services with third-party providers tasked with providing last-mile access. This results in a reduction in operational and maintenance overhead.\n\nAn example of a company divesting its assets is the Indonesian telco XL Axiata which has sold 6,000 radio towers since 2014.\n\nIn 2020, the Lagos State Government also moved to provide the infrastructure that telcos can latch on to provide telecommunications service to customers through its partnership with Western Telecommunications and Engineering Services Metro Limited.\n\nIt appears that Airtel is choosing to go this route as it aims to reduce its debt and increase competitiveness.",

          "text": "Following a partnership between Releaf \u2014 an agritech startup \u2014 and fintech startup, OnePipe, farmers in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states can now easily access digital financial services.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, Releaf\u2019s Co-founder and CTO, Uzoma Ayogu, said, \u201cSince inception, Releaf has empowered over 1,000 farmers to supply over 10 million kilograms of quality crops to various food factories.\n\nWhile disbursements to our farmers have been largely cash-based, we now have access to digitised fund disbursement via embedded, customised accounts, provisioned by OnePipe, to drive financial inclusion of previously financially excluded farmers in the digital economy.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that Releaf is exploring the provision of insurance services leveraging OnePipe\u2019s infrastructure and partnerships. The partnership provides the farmers with an embedded account branded as Releaf Wallet, which can be opened and operated by USSD and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) channels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these accounts, the farmers can receive money from any bank/channel, transfer funds to any Nigerian bank account, and purchase airtime for themselves or third parties.\n\nLike most digital finance services on offer, they can also access loans with the loan amounts increasing according to their wallet usage.\n\nAccording to OnePipe\u2019s Founder and Chief Plumber, Ope Adeoye, \u201cworking with Releaf was inevitable as the company\u2019s vision to transform Africa\u2019s agricultural future by making decentralised food processing scaleable coincides with OnePipe\u2019s social mandate to drive financial inclusion through technology for all \u2014 including the 700m+ smallholder farmers on the continent.\u201d\n\nAs of May 30, 2021, data from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) reveals that 48 million Nigerians had a BVN. With Nigeria\u2019s adult population sitting at 105 million according to the World Population Review, that means that 57 million Nigerians are unbanked.\n\nWhile fintech startups have sprung up trying to increase the number of Nigerians connected to financial services, they have mostly solved the problems associated using existing financial services.\n\nResearch shows that poverty, a lack of education, or living in rural areas \u2014 all qualities of the average Nigerian smallholder farmer \u2014 are barriers to financial inclusion.\n\nReleaf\u2019s partnership with OnePipe is a welcome development that follows the playbook used by super apps in Asia.\n\nMost of the farmers who work with Releaf are smallholder farmers who live in rural areas. By providing them with an opportunity to access financial services through digital channels, they can create a digital footprint enabling them to access more financial services, thus accelerating their financial inclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear if this service is available to farmers outside Releaf\u2019s network.\n\nFounded by Isaiah Udotong, Ikenna Nzewi, and Uzoma Ayogu in 2017, Releaf was originally an online marketplace that connected buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities to trustworthy customers.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2017, receiving $120,000 in funding. After the founders returned to Nigeria, they continued to provide a marketplace for agricultural commodities until they realised that food factories were struggling to secure raw materials for their operations.\n\nThis led to a change in priority as the startup now functions as a raw materials procurement and logistics platform with oil palm as the leading product.\n\nThrough this partnership with OnePipe, it is expected that smallholder farmers in Nigeria, most of whom lack access to financial services, can now access financial services and, in the process, drive Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion goals.",

          "title": "Nourishing dairy with tech, a path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth?",
          "text": "Milk\u2019s nutritional value compares favourably to its economic value. According to Agrilinks, milk is a commodity in high demand in Nigeria, with over a billion tons needed annually. Unfortunately, several factors impede Nigeria\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for dairy products.\n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations says, \u201cA healthy productive population is increasingly recognized not only as resulting from but also as an important prerequisite for poverty reduction and economic and social development.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, the FAO declared June 1 World Milk Day to highlight the importance of milk and draw attention to the global dairy sector.\n\nSadly, two decades later, Nigeria\u2019s milk production pales in comparison to its potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) reports that pastoral systems, which yield meagre output, produce 90% of Nigeria\u2019s milk.\n\nConsequently, the country relies heavily on imported milk. According to a Vanguard article, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) estimates that $1.5 billion is spent on milk importation annually.\n\nDeveloped countries have employed scientific and technological innovations in the dairy sector. The US, for instance, is the second-largest producer of milk globally per the FAO. And according to Statista, it made $40.4 billion from milk in 2020.\n\nThe dairy industry\u2019s success in developed countries is mainly due to adopting technologies that make larger herds profitable. These technologies, as the FAO puts it, \u201crequire large capital investments.\u201d From milking to preserving to distribution, the role of technology in the dairy sector cannot be overemphasised.\n\nThe quest for indigenous milk\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe demand for milk in Nigeria is an opportunity to generate revenue internally. Besides the imperfect production process, Data by AsokoInsights reveals that the country has 20 million cows \u2014 the fourth-largest herd in Africa \u2014 but only 11.5% are used for milk. In contrast, 88.5% go towards producing beef.\n\nResearch by SpringerLink highlights reasons for Nigeria, and by extension, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s failing dairy sector. Subsistence-oriented modes of production and the genetic make-up of indigenous cows are some of many.\n\nAccording to AsokoInsights, Nigerian cows can only produce between one and a half to two litres of milk daily. A cow in Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s largest producers of dairy products, produces 30 litres of milk daily.\n\nCorroborating AsokoInsights submission, research by the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, shows that only two African countries \u2014 Ethiopia and Kenya \u2014 are self-sufficient in milk production. For context, Africa has five times the number of dairy cows in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can infer from Dairy Australia\u2019s account of the milk-making process that, unlike most parts of Africa, dairy production is more technology-driven in developed countries like the US and New Zealand.\n\nFor example, cows are milked using vacuum cups attached to their teats. The milk is then sent to large steel vats and stored at five degrees for two days. It is then pasteurised, increasing shelf-life.\n\nWhile the genetic nature of Nigerian cows cannot be overlooked, the predominantly manual production process poses a major obstacle to a sustainable dairy sector.\n\nMilking Nigeria\u2019s potential\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe Nigerian Dairy Development Program, NDDP, started in 2019 in partnership with Sahel Consulting Agriculture and Nutrition Limited, was designed to help address the local dairy sector\u2019s problems.\n\nAccording to Agrilinks, some local producers who benefited from the programme recorded a 198% increase in milk sales. While this proves the viability of the dairy sector, more still needs to be done.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria, per Nairametrics, released a circular in March 2020 restricting the importation of milk. However, the restriction didn\u2019t affect six companies: FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria, Chi Limited, TG Arla Dairy Products Limited, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc., and Integrated Dairies Limited.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s restriction is a way of enabling backward integration in the dairy sector. Ekiti State\u2019s Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Akin Oyebode, explains why the CBN\u2019s directive might not work and what Ekiti State is doing differently.\n\nIn a tweet on April 22, 2021, Oyebode announced the arrival of 250 Jersey cows in Nigeria to be delivered to Ikun Dairy Farm, Ekiti State. This was a sequel to a joint venture between Promasidor Group, a food and beverage company, and the state government.\n\nGot 41 of c. 250 heifers in today, due to their weight (mostly pregnant) and available cargo space. Hope to get the other 200+ in very soon. Another tiny milestone hit. pic.twitter.com/rWzequMybQ \u2014 Akin Oyebode (@AO1379) February 9, 2021\n\nOyebode tells Techpoint Africa that Promasidor was a strategic choice by the state government. Unlike some of the other companies restricted by the CBN, Promasidor is not from a milk-producing country. According to him, companies in milk-producing countries would be hesitant to develop Nigeria\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nThe strategic joint venture is leading to the gradual revitalisation of the Ikun Dairy Farm (IDF).\n\nOyebode identifies low-yield cows as one of the sector\u2019s challenges, hence the importation of Jersey cows. According to him, 40 indigenous cows in the IDF produce 60 litres of milk a day, while six Jersey cows produce 150 litres a day.\n\n\u201cThe cow variant in Nigeria has been really focused on beef, and we generally do a lot of open grazing over long distances. Over the years, the genes of our cows won\u2019t give us the kind of milk that we require,\u201d Oyebode says.\n\nHe adds that it will take a long period for Nigeria to regain the milk-generating capabilities of its cows through cross-breeding.\n\nOyebode admits that while factors like science and technology go into building a sustainable dairy farm, they will be futile if the cow yield isn\u2019t proportional to the infrastructural inputs.\n\nHowever, Alhaji Muhammadu Damakka Abubakar, Executive Director and owner of L & Z Integrated Farms Nigeria Limited, a dairy company established over 15 years ago, believes low-yield cows are not a major problem for the country\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nHe cites India, the largest producer of milk globally, as an example.\n\n\u201cAverage milk per cow in India is not up to ten litres, but they have plenty, so if you have low-yielding cows but in large numbers, it makes up for their low yield.\u201d\n\nAbubakar believes the problem isn\u2019t the low-yield cows but the technology used in the milk collection process. Also, rather than open grazing, he suggests ranching as an alternative.\n\n\u201cThe era of allowing cows to roam is gone,\u201d Abubakar says.\n\nWith 20 million cows milked optimally \u2014 using a technologically-based milking system \u2014 in the right conditions with the right tools, he maintains that Nigeria will produce enough milk to meet the demand.\n\nWhile increasing cow yield can be looked into in the long run, Abubakar says using the indigenous cows optimally should be prioritised.\n\nSpeaking on the dairy sector\u2019s viability, he says, \u201cFrom milk, you can derive over 100 components; and from oil, you have only 20 or 25. A barrel of milk is worth almost 100 times what a barrel of crude oil is worth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a barrel of crude oil is currently worth $67 while its equivalent in milk is worth $57. In terms of daily demand, more crude oil is consumed. Knoema, a data technology company, puts Nigeria\u2019s daily crude oil consumption at 522,000 barrels \u2014 82.9 million litres \u2014 in March 2021.\n\nThese numbers exceed the demand for milk greatly. Per LEADERSHIP, the yearly demand for milk is 1.6 billion litres, putting the daily demand at 4.4 million litres.\n\nWhile these numbers nullify Abubakar\u2019s claims, they do not reduce the viability of the dairy sector as a major source of revenue.",

          "text": "Shares of the South African retail giant Shoprite traded almost 4 percent higher Wednesday, the day the company announced it had received 70 percent of proceeds from the sale of its troubled Nigerian unit.\n\nAt R160.89 a share, Shoprite shares are on track for their best day in about two weeks. The group\u2019s shares have risen almost 15 percent in 2021, and 28 percent since the start of 2020.\n\nShoprite, one of the first South African companies to expand into Nigeria in the early 1990s, recently completed the sale of its supermarket business in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nShoprite had announced its exit from Nigeria in August 2020, and has not put a price on the sale of the business, with the group also closing its last stores in Kenya earlier in 2021. The sale is to a subsidiary of Nigerian property group, Persianas Investments.\n\nThe company said the Nigerian business environment had become unfavourable for its operations and it would be closing down as a result.\n\n\u201cThe Board has decided to initiate a formal process to consider the potential sale of all, or a majority stake, in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited (RSNL), a subsidiary of Shoprite International Limited. As such, RSNL may be classified as a discontinued operation when Shoprite reports its results for the year,\u201d the company had said in a statement released last year.\n\nIn a recent publication, the company announced its investment in Africa, particularly Nigeria and Kenya, had not yielded desired gain and it would like to explore new territories.\n\n\u201cWe are cognisant that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and, for that reason, we are assessing the future for each investment on an individual country basis.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, we have resolved to either find a local partner or sell our Nigerian supermarket business. Furthermore, we have decided we will not allocate any further capital in the pursuit of a Kenyan market greenfields expansion. The region has not met our required return-on-investment targets and, while this factor is in part because the investment is still subscale, we believe now is not the time for Shoprite to lean in and invest further into new territory,\u201d the company said in the report.\n\nThe company also revealed that the exchange rate crisis of the dollar and naira led to a 7.9 percent loss in 2020, when compared to 2019.\n\nThe terms of the transaction include both a franchise agreement that secures the Nigerian business\u2019s right to continue to use the Shoprite brand. It also includes an agreement that provides for administration and technical support from the Shoprite Group for an initial period of five years.\n\nShoprite has been trading in the rest of Africa since 1990 and operates in many markets outside South Africa, including Botswana, Madagascar, Mozambique and Angola. The group, under CEO Pieter Engelbrecht, has been assessing the capital needs of its non-South African operations, which generate less than a quarter of group revenue.\n\nIn 2013, it considered expansion to 44 Shoprite stores across Nigeria, but halted the expansion project after encountering various challenges in the West African country. In 2019, Engelbrecht said the group would not remain in Nigeria at any cost.\n\nIn that year, it faced lower consumer demand in Nigeria as locals boycotted South African brands to protest against xenophobic violence in South Africa.\n\nShoprite follows Tiger Brands, Woolworths and Mr Price in exiting the country, which is seen as a difficult market to operate, amid oil price and currency volatility, and difficulties in repatriating funds.\n\nShoprite said on Wednesday that the transaction took effect on May 23, with 70 percent of the transaction proceeds having been received and the balance due in four equal instalments over 30 months.\n\nShoprite, valued at R95 billion on the JSE, had treated the Nigerian business as a discontinued operation in its half year to end-December, reporting that assets held for sale amounted to R1.4 billion, while the liabilities of these assets stood at R1.56 billion.\n\nAt the end of December, its core business, Supermarkets SA, made up 78 percent of group sales, with 1,685 stores under the Shoprite, Usave, Checkers, Checkers Hyper and LiquorShop brands.\n\nIt had 417 stores outside South Africa, including its discontinued operations.\n\nThe company says it will be focused on investing in technology and its employees.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus on further investment in building our information and technology-driven business infrastructure. We are firm believers that the future will be strongly data-led and as such, we are strengthening and future-proofing our business and strategy by investing in our IT ecosystem and our people,\u201d the company said.",

          "text": "In a bid to boost confidence in its major asset, which is land, Lagos State government has reduced time for registering property and also for obtaining construction permit.\n\nThe state has consolidated all payment fees and taxes for property registration into a single demand notice with the aim of making doing business in the state a lot easier and even \u2018cheaper.\u2019\n\nThe sprawling city has also strengthened real estate transaction regulations with the setting up a 16-man technical committee piloted by the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (LASRERA).\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had, shortly after assuming office in 2019, reversed the Land Use Charge, which raised enormous dust when it was reviewed upwards, to pre-2018 levels.\n\nThe implication of these moves is not only that they enhance ease of doing business in the state, which is an otherwise difficult business environment, but also to boost investors\u2019 confidence and raise public trust in real estate and land-related business in the state.\n\nThe consolidation of the property registration fees, for instance, has led to the reduction in the number of days required to obtain Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) and Governor\u2019s Consent. This has come down from 72 to 61 days, according Hakeem Okunola, the state\u2019s Head of Service (HoS).\n\nThe state\u2019s e-planning platform has also been activated for the submission of all construction permit applications such that the fee procedures and laws are now on the website, while there is also a reduction in the average number of days for obtaining construction permit from 42 to 28 days.\n\nThese steps are of tremendous assistance to investors who, before now, have been finding it difficult getting property registration and construction permit. It was worse for those of them who were exposed to bank credit as their projects could not take off yet interest on the loans were running.\n\nRead Also:Veritasi reiterates commitment to provide affordable housing with Eystone\n\nThe HoS, who spoke at the annual ministerial briefing to mark Sanwo-Olu\u2019s second year in office, explained that the decision to take these steps was a response to continuous demand from stakeholders in the built environment through the state\u2019s online complaints and feedback\u2014the Citizengate.\n\nAt the inaugural meeting of members of the technical committee on regulation, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, special adviser to the Governor on Housing, explained that the committee\u2019s mandate was to design a policy and fiscal framework, institute and promote global best practices in the sector.\n\nShe added that the committee had the mandate of addressing challenges in the sector with particular attention to reforming homeownership model to increase housing stock and reduce the deficit.\n\nLagos, according to a report by the Pison Housing Company, has an estimated 3 million housing demand-supply gap with a very active rental market where over 50 percent of the state\u2019s 20 million population lives in a rented apartment.\n\nIt is, therefore, hoped that a well-regulated real estate market and a friendly business environment that enables more investment in the sector would lead to increased housing stock and less \u2018homelessness.\u2019\n\nBenson-Awoyinka noted that one of the lessons learnt from COVID-19 pandemic was the need to create and develop a robust housing policy with stakeholder involvement and engagement as well as curtail malpractices in the real estate sector, while also improving financial transparency and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\u201cTo achieve its objective, the committee will be required to set up a comprehensive system and framework, which will prioritise the development of a fiscal responsibility and transparency model, to promote the inflow of local and international funding required to confront the housing deficit.\n\n\u201cThe committee will also set up a governance structure that will oversee the entire real estate framework and stakeholder engagement in the state to minimise trust deficit,\u201d she said\n\nThe special adviser explained that the structure would cater to the entire system of the real estate process and incorporate participation from private developers, financial institutions and the government in a Public-Private Partnership model.",

Let us build strong institutions and not individuals. The buildings are there; people have come and gone.\n\n\u201cLet us begin to think of government that way. We must now begin to think of government differently. This is because institutions will take care of us; we also need to start to change the mentality that all arms of government go to collect allocation from Abuja. There is nothing to take. We all have to come together and create the things we need.\u201d\n\nObaseki further reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, in its efforts at making Edo great again.\n\n\u201cMy message to you is one of hope. As young people, you must have hope; the fact that our oil revenue is falling on a daily basis should not bother us. Nigeria was a better country when we didn\u2019t have crude oil.\n\n\u201cIt will continue to be a better country when crude oil is no longer a factor in our lives and it\u2019s only you that can make it happen. The only way this will happen is when we realize that the government is about you and when you participate in governance.\n\n\u201cThe structure of government that we run needs to change; it has to be more localized; it has to be more inclusive. You need to participate \u2013 not just sit down and participate on social media \u2013 in your community; speak up,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nEarlier, the State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa, while giving his opening remarks, said that the state civil and public service has been the focal point of government\u2019s attention.\n\nAlso, a participant, Alhaji Evbareke Ahmed, urged the governor to ensure the completion of the Benin River Port, adding that it would further create job opportunities for youths.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday said his government is committed to youth development.\n\nThe governor spoke at the launch of Osun Youth Policy Document to develop and empower young people in the state and put them at the centre of development.\n\nThe newly-unveiled Youth Policy Document which has four components 4Es\u2014Youth Empowerment, Youth Engagement, Youth Entrepreneurship and Youth Education, was developed to provide a crucial framework for guiding the state\u2019s approach to ensuring that large number of youth residing in the state are provided with quality of life.\n\nLaunching the Policy Document at the Aurora Event Centre, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola said his administration has enunciated a clear policy framework to ensure that an enabling environment is created for the youth to maximally realise their creative and productive potential.\n\nHe noted that the Osun Youth Policy contains commitment by government, the youth of the state and the society in pursuance of youth development and growth.\n\n\u201cAs captured in the Policy, youth development is holistic and integrated, requiring the support and active involvement of all relevant Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Youth Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and the Public Sector, Private Sector and Philanthropists,\u201d he said.\n\nOyetola who described the youth as the most productive, efficient and energetic segment of the population, said his administration has invested tremendously in them as part of efforts to build a virile and sustainable economy and ensure all-round growth and development.\n\nAccording to him, the youth have part of the reasons the administration since it came to power, hence, the careful crafting of Osun Development Agenda to bring all the sectors and the people into the development net.\n\nHe said his administration has been engaging youths productively as loans ranging from N500,000 to N2, 500,000 were facilitated for 4,650 people and that efforts were on to increase the number of the beneficiaries.\n\nOyetola added that the unveiling of the Youth Policy Document was to further demonstrate his administration\u2019s commitment to youth development, saying that government remains resolute to continuously engage in research and monitoring, while deploying an effective evaluation template to constantly enrich the initiative and ensure proper and sustainable implementation of the policy.\n\n\u201cYouth is a critical stage in the life cycle of human beings because of the admixture of high energy, enthusiasm, insecurities, idealism, confusion and challenges that characterise this unique life stage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe youth are the hope of our nation and our State. They are the face and engine of any meaningful sustainable development. Unfortunately, in our clime, social norms and practices often exclude them from participating in critical decision-making pertaining to their lives and activities with dire consequences.\n\n\u201cConscious of this misnomer and intent on correcting it to harness the bundle of energy that characterises youth, our government has in recent times focused its attention on the youth, while designing programmes and projects that impact on youth empowerment, employment and social justice.\n\n\u201cThe people, including the youth, are the reason we are in government. Our Administration came into office on the shoulders of Development Agenda, a programme carefully created to bring all the sectors and the people into the development net.\n\n\u201cWithin two years after coming into office, we have delivered adequate and quality services, projects and programmes across the State in a manner that will sustain the peace in the State, transform the economy, industrialise the State, provide jobs for the people, especially the youth, and provide security and welfare for the people.\n\n\u201cWe are also determined to use sports as a vehicle for encouraging school enrolment and retention and talent identification, just as we intend using it to create opportunities for young people in our rural communities.\n\n\u201cOnly two days ago, the State Executive Council gave approval for the commencement of Osun Sports Festival. The first edition will commence in June this year.\n\n\u201cThe unveiling of the Osun Youth Policy Document today is to further demonstrate our Administration\u2019s commitment to youth development.\n\n\u201cI therefore, recommend the document to all levels of government for accelerated implementation as the roles of all stakeholders are clearly spelt out.\n\n\u201cI want to also assure all the youth in the State that this new State Youth Policy vividly captures workable strategies for achieving the Youth Development Plan of the present Administration and we will do all that is necessary to ensure that, in collaboration with other Stakeholders, the lofty intention of the Policy is made a reality for our teeming youths,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Hon. Yemi Lawal, said the newly- launched Youth Policy Document would serve as a veritable tool towards the actualisation of the lofty programmes of the administration to guarantee a better future for the youth.\n\nLawal who described the document as the first in the history of the state, expressed confidence in its significance to redefine the socioeconomic fortune of the young ones and by extension make life more meaningful and worthwhile for them.\n\nHe said the Document came into being after various stakeholders meetings with members carefully drawn from relevant MDAs; the leadership of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Osun State Chapter; Representatives of both State and National Youth Parliaments; Political Youth Leaders; Student Bodies, as well as the officials of the Ministry of Youth and Sports to work on the production of the Document so as to have a guide that will be acceptable to all.\n\nThe Youth and Sports Commissioner further stated, \u201cThere is the need to protect the present life of these young persons in order to safeguard their future. With this in mind in mind, the Government of Osun has been striving to ensure that the youth of the State are given various opportunities through education and empowerment programmes at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe State Government had worked out this Document that would serve as policy direction for the entire youths. I commend the strong desire of the present Administration in the State under the leadership of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola who seeks to improve socioeconomic and general well being of the young people in the State.\u201d\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Akanbi and the Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Abolarinwa Odedokun, urged Nigerian youths to take their destines in their own hands.\n\nThe monarchs who commended the Governor on the lofty initiative, expressed the hope that the document would go a long way to address the challenges confronting the youth in the State in particular and the nation at large.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye, attributed the conceptualisation and unveiling of the Policy to the positive manifestation of the \u2018all inclusiveness\u2019 posture of the Governor Oyetola Administration.\n\nTimothy noted that the Policy would further create opportunity for the youths to be more productive and fully engaged in things that would bring about socioeconomic values to their lives.\n\nHe commended the Governor for developing a Document that would help the youths of the State to take their rightful positions in the world.",
          "summary": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, OsogboOsun state Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday said his government is committed to youth development.\nThe governor spoke at the launch of Osun Youth Policy Document to develop and empower young people in the state and put them at the centre of development.\nHe noted that the Osun Youth Policy contains commitment by government, the youth of the state and the society in pursuance of youth development and growth.\n\u201cAs captured in the Policy, youth development is holistic and integrated, requiring the support and active involvement of all relevant Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Youth Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and the Public Sector, Private Sector and Philanthropists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe unveiling of the Osun Youth Policy Document today is to further demonstrate our Administration\u2019s commitment to youth development.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nFounder, Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari against ordering military invasion of Nigeria\u2019s South East region, as according to him, such move would lead to chaos and an unprecedented meltdown of the country.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Uko who is also the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), warned that military invasion rather than resolve the security situation in the zone, will make things much worse, even as it could lead to anarchy.\n\nUko\u2019s warning comes amid reports that President Buhari had concluded plans to order a major military operation in all the five states of the South East in response to recent attacks on police stations and other public facilities in the zone by gunmen amid growing agitations for a separate state of Biafra.\n\nOnline newspaper, TheCable quoted multiple security sources to have confirmed that President Buhari has given the security agencies the marching order to curtail the attacks.\n\nBuhari had in a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle, @Mbuhari on Tuesday, tweeted that, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to say that the agitators would soon get the shock of their lives, an indication that he had a major military operation in mind.\n\nThe tweet which referenced the 1967-1970 Biafra war, in which an estimated three million people, mostly in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast, were killed, including over a million children starved to death by food blockade, however, sparked angry reactions from many Nigerians on the social media platform, with many reminding the president that he had not made similar moves against bandits wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s Northwest and Boko Haram in the Northeast.\n\nReacting to the speculations, Uko emphasized that dialogue remained the only viable solution, as according to him, an invasion could lead to an all out conflict and Nigeria may never be the same again.\n\n\u201cRumours of proclamation of a state of emergency and the invasion of South East Nigeria by contingents and battalions of Nigerian military any time now, should not be true,\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cIf it is, then, the largest black nation on earth, may drift into an unexpected and unprecedented meltdown, which may be difficult to contain and impossible to control, and that would be because the rulers of the land, do not have the faintest idea of the resolve and anger in the souls of majority of the citizens of that region. The rulers will certainly meet unexpected reaction from the people of the zone. 51 year old pent-up anger in their hearts will explode in an unimaginable dimension, that may make it extremely difficult to save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe stored up anger and bitterness in the hearts of Serbs as their parents retold stories about the sufferings of their people during the siege of Sarajevo in the 19th century, ensured the destruction of Yugoslavia over a century later.\n\n\u201cThose planning to invade South East and conquer the region, clearly, do not know the pain and humiliation the people of the region have had to endure and swallow for years, their strength and wealth, and especially the commitment of the diaspora population, and their readiness for a long and protracted struggle for justice and freedom from oppression. The government underestimates the mindset of over 20 million Igbo youths scattered all over the world, who have sworn not to hand over a situation of eternal servitude as permanent onlookers in the Nigerian project, to their progeny.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whatever may be wrong with the methods of the agitators, 90 percent of the masses, sympathizes with their cause, therein lies the problem.\n\n\u201cThe government will not face stiff resistance from the people, because the agitators are saints, angels and very polite folks, agitating with humility, no, that doesn\u2019t bother the people. The people are rather, very deeply offended, that the same government that has refused to rein in the deadly Fulani herdsmen who have made it extremely difficult for them to farm in their ancestral lands, paid hundreds of millions to vicious armed bandits terrorizing the North West, are suddenly bringing war to the most isolated, ostracised and persecuted region in the country.\n\n\u201cThis planned and ill-advised military campaign to the South East, will only confirm and affirm the rhetorics of the agitators, that the South East is deliberately hated and unwanted in the land. It will be difficult to convince the people otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe collateral damage in terms of human lives of innocent citizens, damage to infrastructure, rude interruption and destruction of economic life, and obstruction of trade, academic pursuits and civil and social activities, will produce enough bitterness and hatred of the central government, that the agitators will become heroes and idols of the much oppressed people of the zone.\n\n\u201cI have been closely involved with Igbo youths for close to 4 decades. I know that the last 2 years have been a remarkable period in the renaissance of ideas for self determination, never before experienced in this clime. I happen to know, not because I am a very smart person, but because I have intensely interacted with Igbo youths over the years and managed to earn their confidence.\n\n\u201cI say this confidently: Neither their parents nor teachers have any idea the degree of anger and bitterness in the hearts of Igbo youths born between 1990 and 2000, who are aged between 31 and 21 years of age. Certainly not the government. The whole world is in for a rude shock, you may wish to take my words to the bank.\n\n\u201cThe government, politicians and leaders across strata, made terrible mistakes by misjudging the agitators and applying very wrong strategy, that led to this unpleasant tension in the land. Military option will spiral into a conflagration that will be difficult to contain.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it is important, to advise the South East Governors to, urgently meet with and explain to Mr President, the true situation on ground. Dialogue should replace military action. The government has never demanded a list of grievances from the agitators, government must do so now. More bloodshed will only prepare the ground for a bitter, protracted conflict, that will certainly change Nigeria for ever.\n\n\u201cNobody supports the agitators\u2019 sudden militant posture. But the brigandage of the ruthless Fulani herdsmen and their seeming above-the-law arrogance, forced the helpless masses to embrace the agitators\u2019 defence militia.\n\n\u201cThe refusal by government to invite and hear the grievances of the agitators and the decision to only kill them extra-judicially, granted the agitators, huge sympathy. Marching in to kill more of them, will complicate matters completely.\n\n\u201cBesides, Nigeria\u2019s multiple heamorage on many fronts, and the deep silence of the international community to support and advise Nigeria on the urgency to restructure the polity and adopt a new federal constitution, that would enthrone equity, suggests a conspiracy to programme Africa\u2019s largest nation to implode.\n\n\u201cHeavily indebted, with a steady inflation figures, unrest in all the regions, weak economy and agitation for seccesion thriving in the South East and South West, military action in the East will ensure the utter destruction of the road to peace.\n\n\u201cWhy is our colonial master watching and not advocating a new constitution for Nigeria? Why is the Bohemian club silently watching. Why is the council on foreign relations, the trilateral commission, the U.S state department etc, not pushing for a new people\u2019s constitution for Nigeria. Is their a silent conspiracy by the west, to watch Nigeria implode?\n\n\u201cHow come, all the eggheads in Nigeria are pretending they do not know that military invasion of the South East, will have dire consequences, first on the economy, and then on the unity and the very survival of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe government should engage the agitators in a dialogue. Military option should be out of it.\n\n\u201cIt is very doubtful if other regions will applaud the decision by the federal government to use military operation in the east to save the 1999 constitution. Everybody knows where Nigeria\u2019s problem is rooted. Insistence on preserving the 1999 constitution with the blood of citizens is unholy.\n\n\u201cHistory will judge all our actions today.\u201d",

If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? Are we the ones guilty of double standards? I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications have emerged that Buhari, in fulfilment of his threat, has ordered a major military offensive in the region, further raising concerns of possible human rights abuses and extra-judicial killings\n\nOnline newspaper, TheCable quoted multiple security sources to have confirmed that President Buhari has given the security agencies the marching order to curtail what many Nigerians fear is a descent to anarchy.\n\n\u201cThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has recruited over 50,000 foot soldiers, as it were, into its Eastern Security Network (ESN) and stockpiled arms, most of which were stolen from police armoury during the End SARS protests,\u201d a security operative told TheCable.\n\n\u201cThey have been bringing in arms through Cameroon in partnership with the Ambazonia Governing Council, the separatist movement in Southern Cameroon. IPOB sends at least 2,000 men and women to Cameroon for training on weapon handling every week.\u201d\n\nAnother top security official said IPOB has stockpiled \u201cbottle bombs\u201d, locally made explosive devices, Pump Action rifles \u201cas well as swords\u201d.\n\nIn a recorded tape, two people described as \u201ctop commanders of ESN\u201d were heard discussing issues such as surveillance of INEC offices, militants wounded in previous attacks, operations of IPOB camps, doctors treating wounded colleagues, installation of CCTV camera at their training camps in Udi, Emene and Nsukka and how to attack police cells,\u201d TheCable reported.\n\nIPOB has, however, denied being violent in its separatist campaign, but it has also said it assembles arms and ammunition locally.",

The International Transfer System must also be fit for purpose. A transfer market fuelled by speculation and not solidarity means a growing risk of conflicts of interest, huge market inflation and an increasing competitive imbalance.\n\n\u201cIn response, we have created the FIFA Clearing House, a central counterpart in charge of performing all required checks in player transfers, and ensuring the money paid by the purchasing club is correctly distributed to the training clubs in compliance with national and international financial regulations.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe FIFA President reiterated how all FIFA activities should be carried out with transparency, supported by all appropriate checks and assurances.\n\n\u201cWe must have bidding processes that are fully transparent, have clear evaluation criteria and abide by ethical principles, as well as the allocation of FIFA World Cup and FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup hosts voted on by the FIFA Congress,\u201d President Infantino said.\n\n\u201cThis has already been the case for the FIFA World Cup in 2026 in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and will be the process followed for the first time in the selection of the hosts for the next FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201d",

I promise that the NFF will support you in coming up with feasible plans and programmes to achieve your mission,\u201d Gusau said.\n\nNFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, pledged the secretariat\u2019s full support for the committee: \u201cOur responsibility as secretariat is to work closely with your committee to achieve your aim and objectives.

          "text": "Since the Presidential Committee on Correctional Service Reform and Decongestion (PCCSRD), which is saddled with the responsibility of reforming correctional service centres across the country was inaugurated by the attorney-general of the federation and minister of justice four years ago, it has visited over 32 correctional centres in 18 states to get first hand information and see the true state of correctional service centres in the country.\n\nDuring the visit, inmates with minor offences who were unable to pay their fines were freed after the necessary fines were paid by the AGF and other non-governmental organisations that partnered with the committee.\n\nAlso, inmates who had very critical health challenges and had served a good number of their sentences were recommended for release after necessary documentations were made. Some were also recommended for state pardon by the committee.\n\nAfter the visit to correctional centres, the committee has started the second phase of the juvenile decongestion programme.\n\nThis time, the committee, headed by the immediate past Chief Judge of the federal capital territory, Justice (Dr.) Ishaq Bello, visited Girls Remand home, Idi-Araba and the Boys Remand Home, Oregun, both in Lagos .\n\nJustice Bello(Rtd), while addressing stakeholders during the visit, described the occasion as significant because it will afford the Nigeria Correctional SERVICE opportunity for good service delivery.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis occasion is of huge significance to me because I see it as an opportunity to yet again strengthen the capacity of the Nigerian Correctional Service towards good service delivery as it concerns juveniles in detention centres.\n\n\u201cOne of the major objectives of the correctional reform and the ensuing advocacy campaign of the committee, is to reposition the Nigerian Correctional Centres as well as Borstal Institutions/Remand Homes, with the mandate to rehabilitate and reintegrate inmates, most especially juveniles back into the society.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn an effort to achieve our objective, the committee after visiting over 32 correctional centres in 18 states, observed that there were only three federal borstal institutes in Nigeria; Ogun, Kwara and Kaduna states. We found that these institutes were grossly inadequate, and over-crowded which has resulted in the ugly practice of sending juveniles to adult correctional centres. This is leaving a bad taste in the society as such juveniles are exposed to hardened criminals which in-turn negatively influences their chances of reoffending if released.\n\n\u201cTo address this, the federal ministry of justice in collaboration with the committee and the support of NGOs such as the Buniyadi Foundation has commenced the juvenile decongestion programme.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe decongestion programme is focused on rehabilitating and reintegrating qualified juveniles from the three federal borstal institutes back into the society.\n\nThe committee had also proposed a range of interventions to reduce reoffending in juveniles to Mr. President and these include, therapeutic measures to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviour, as well as provision of services to prepare juveniles for reintegration into the society after release.\n\nAccording to the chairman, some of these services include enrollment in academic programmes and skills acquisition, in areas such as carpentry, plumbing, shoe and soap making amongst others.\n\nDuring the visit to the remand homes in Idi-Araba and Oregun, Justice Bello said the purpose of the visit is for members of the committee to come here and see what facilities exist for juveniles.\n\n\u201cThis will allow us make our own report and recommendations to Mr. President through the Office of the Hon. Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to understand the urgent need to build more borstal homes in the country as there are only three (3); Ogun, Kwara and Kaduna; at the Federal level.\n\n\u201cThis is to avoid and tackle the ongoing problem of remanding juveniles in correctional facilities established for adult offenders. .\n\n\u201cThis practice results in disastrous consequences as these juveniles become hardened criminals as a result of being exposed to hardened convicts. The aim and expectation of remanding juveniles is to have them be more polished and reformed as they are released back to the society and reduce their risk of reoffending.\n\n\u201cWe penciled down some states where we know such good juvenile facilities exist and Lagos is one of such states, which is why we are here today., to commence the juvenile decongestion programme and learn from the experiences of Lagos state, where a lot of good work has been done and is worthy of emulation. This will be encapsulated in our report to Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe Committee and some NGOs such as Buniyadi Foundation is willing to support the centre with after care kits for girls who have learnt a skill and are ready for release, they need to be equipped to properly be reintegrated into the society. the federal ministry of justice and the Buniyadi Foundation will take up the surgery bills of 2 boys at the Oregun centre.",

Mr. Dega is survived by his wife Kashimana and children.\n\nMeanwhile, the police have announced that some suspects in the gruesome assassination of Dega have been arrested.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the Plateau State Command, signed by its Public Relations Officer, Ubah Ogaba, a massive investigation has been launched into the incident.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State Police Command on a sad note received an ugly report of the death of AIG Christopher Dega (Rtd). On 31/05/2021 at about 2030hrs, AIG Christopher Dega (Rtd) was shot dead by three yet to be identified gunmen in an isolated restaurant at Bukuru, Jos.\n\n\u201cFrom the investigation so far, it appeared that he was trailed and shot. He arrived at Jos from Makurdi on the same date at about 1930hrs. Some suspects have been arrested. Meanwhile, the investigation is ongoing.\u201d\n\nIn Imo, Amukamara, the PDP youth leader in Oru-East Local Government Area of the state was assassinated by the gunmen on Monday night in Umuokwe village.\n\nThey also burnt down his house and car during the attack, it was gathered.\n\nThe gruesome murder was confirmed by the Imo State PDP youth Leader, Greg Nwadike.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cFinally confirming the assassination of the PDP LGA Youth Leader of Oru-East LGA, Imo State, Comrade Kenneth Amukamara.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was assassinated Monday night at his home in Awo-Omamma by assailants and his house with his brother said to have been set ablaze. Sketchy information available say about two other members of his family were also killed.\u201d\n\nReacting to the killing of his aide, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom condemned the assassination describing it as a huge blow to his administration and the entire state.\n\nThe Governor while speaking to journalists on Wednesday at Benue Peoples House, Makurdi, lamented that the retired AIG was very active even in retirement, saying it was painful that he was gunned down in such a gruesome manner.\n\n\u201cRetired AIG Dega served with me here and this is someone who has retired but is not tired and was very active. So for him to have been murdered in the manner they did, a retired AIG gunned down.

Many condemned the tone of the message which referenced the 1967 civil war, in which millions of lives were lost.\n\nThe President subtly boasted about the role he played alongside other Nigerian military officers in the Nigerian Civil War of 1966-70, during which over three million Igbo were killed, many of them rounded up and shot at close range or starved to death.\n\nA check on the president\u2019s official account reveals that the Tweet has been removed.\n\nTwitter explained the move by stating that the tweet violated its rules.\n\n\u201cWhen we determine that a Tweet violated the Twitter Rules, we require the violator to remove it before they can Tweet again.\n\nWe send an email notification to the violator identifying the Tweet(s) in violation and which policies have been violated.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will then need to go through the process of removing the violating Tweet or appealing our review if they believe we made an error.\u201d\n\nHowever, former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari following Twitter\u2019s deletion of his sensitive tweet on Nigerian Civil War.\n\nReacting to Twitter\u2019s deletion of Buhari\u2019s tweet, Fayose mocked: \u201cWhen is Mr President Buhari using his power as Commander-in-chief to \u201cshow Twitter pepper\u201d for deleting his tweets? Or Twitter will just delete our President\u2019s tweets just like that and there won\u2019t be consequences?\u201d\n\nThe former governor added: \u201cNigeria is boiling everywhere and all that the President can do is to be threatening genocide up and down.\n\n\u201cNow that Twitter has dealt with our almighty President Buhari, won\u2019t he \u201cdeal\u201d with Twitter too? Like Trump, like Buhari.\u201d\n\nHe said it was obvious that those exercising Buhari\u2019s powers for him did not know when and where to stop their power-madness.\n\n\u201cRegrettable, Twitter may not know that the President isn\u2019t the one operating the handle.\n\n\u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis.\n\n\u201cTwitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lie Mohammad and co accountable,\u201d he tweeted.",

So they\u2019re absolutely outside the realm of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just rebels, arsonists and criminals in short. So, what are we going to consider to even give them a chance to come and say their wish and let Nigeria tremble and bow before them and say \u2018okay, we\u2019ve granted you your wish.\u2019\n\nThose insurgency in the Southeast, they\u2019re all claiming that they want their own country called Biafra right? If that is the case, is it by killing people that they\u2019ll get their country?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried it before, do they want us to go back to the same route? I don\u2019t think so. But if they do, if that\u2019s what they choose, has Nigeria got any choice?\n\n\u201cWill we just allow them, bow and say, \u2018we\u2019ll grant you your own wish?\u2019 No. Nigerian government has to stand out, fight them and give them what they want.\u201d\n\nThe South-East have been clamouring to be given the opportunity to produce the next President of the country come 2023, but Senator Bulkachuwa pointed out that politics is a game of number, adding that political parties should be allowed to present the right candidates from any zone for Nigerians to pick from.\n\n\u201cI believe these banditry, kidnappings, agitations and killings are all prelude to the 2023 election,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even believe in zoning. I believe the right candidates should be fielded by all the parties and then let Nigerians choose from the best among them.\n\nAnd those who have the number, who believe in the same candidate will obviously win. Unless you don\u2019t want that which is against the norms of democracy, then, I don\u2019t know, you can devise your own means.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe zoning is democratic.

Hence, Malami discharges his constitutionally recognised mandates in compliance with principles of transparency, openness and accountability.\u201d\n\nNigeria has the history of suspension of the constitution only during the many years of military dictatorship when the country was governed by decree.\n\nMr Buhari himself led the country between 1984 and 1985 as a military dictator during which the constitution was put on suspension.\n\nThe closest to it that Nigeria has seen since the return to democratic rule in 1999 was during the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo when democratic institutions were suspended in some states where state of emergency was declared in response to security concerns.\n\nBut former President Goodluck Jonathan resisted to take such controversial decision when he declared a state of emergency in some states during his administration.\n\nRead AGF Malami\u2019s Statement in full.\n\n*I am Pro-Constitutional Democracy- Malami*\n\nThe attention of the Office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN has been drawn to a false and fictitious report alleging that there was a secret memo emanating from the Office to the Presidency.\n\nGeneral publics are hereby asked to disregard the media report as fabrications of anti-constitutional democratic stability in Nigeria.\n\nMalami remains a true democrat who believes in rules of law and tenant of democracy and Constitutional order.\n\nThe Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is a constitutionally recognised one with its role and responsibilities embedded in the constitution.\n\nIt is antithetical to common sense to think that the holder of such coveted Office as the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will stoop to what was printed by the media.\n\nThe Government does not operate in secrecy as it is not a clandestine operation.

          "title": "Insecurity: Wike\u2019s comments spark fresh PDP, APC brawl",
          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are at \u2018war\u2019 over a recent statement credited to Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nGovernor Wike had berated the APC-led government for poor handling of the escalating violence, killing and other acts of terrorism across the country.\n\nReplying both Wike and his party-the PDP-the ruling APC said the current level of insecurity in the country could be blamed on the \u201cinept manner\u201d with which the opposition party handled the Boko Haram terrorists while it held sway as the ruling party.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday in Abuja by the secretary to the APC national caretaker committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the party insisted the seeds of the insecurity which the APC administration was containing were sown by the PDP administration when it handled the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the remarks by the Rivers state governor, \u201cwhose party members call a dictator, flies against the continuous efforts of our security forces who are toiling day and night and successfully rolled back the Boko Haram insurgency it inherited to a small part on the shores of Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall that the insurgents once attacked places of worship, markets and gathering of citizens in many states of the Federation before the APC administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari galvanised and equipped the armed forces to degrade their capacity to strike all over the country.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that the dictator at the Rivers State government house has forgotten so soon that kidnapping for ransom, like the Boko Haram insurgency, did not start under this administration, but every effort is being made to stop it along with its twin evil of banditry.\n\n\u201cThe APC administration has consistently worked for the best interest of Nigeria and will not be distracted by the antics of the PDP designed to mislead Nigerians into assuming that the PDP they rejected in free and fair elections in 2015 and 2019 is worthy of their trust.\n\n\u201cA leopard cannot change its spots. The PDP is clearly in disarray. It was a failure in governance and a shocking failure as an opposition party. Nigerians cannot risk the country\u2019s future in the hands of the same political party that brought the rot the APC administration is clearing,\u201d Akpanudoedehe stated.\n\nPDP counters\n\nHowever, PDP national publicity secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan insisted \u201cGovernor Wike, in stating that the future of our nation cannot be left in the hands of the APC, directly spoke the mind of majority of Nigerians across board.\n\n\u201cAs such, any attack on Governor Wike, on this score, is a direct assault on the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNigerians are aware that the PDP administration of President Goodluck Jonathan handed over a united and stable country to the APC and President Muhammadu Buhari after pushing terrorists to the fringes and conducting elections in all parts of our country.\n\n\u201cThe APC has not denied the fact that it was on assumption of its office that terrorism resurged as APC leaders opened up our nation to terrorists, bandits and vandals, including those they brought in from neighbouring countries, as political mercenaries to assist the APC to unleash violence on Nigerians during elections.\n\n\u201cAlso, Nigerians are aware of how the APC administration shielded terrorism apologists in their cabinet; how APC leaders, on several occasions, made case for terrorists, asked Nigerians not to fight back in the face of aggression and even blamed victims of terrorism as witnessed in the case of 43 rice farmers who were beheaded by terrorists in Borno state.\n\n\u201cOur party notes that the APC has been deliberately compromising the security of our nation to allow for chaos, crisis and emergency situation in our country, for their selfish and unpatriotic gains. That also explains why the APC always attack well-meaning Nigerians who seek to unveil their plots.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed unfathomable how the APC and its government, with all the apparatchik of governance available to them, can be looking helplessly and forcing our country into a state of turmoil if the situation in which Nigeria is sunk was not their design.\n\n\u201cAs Governor Wike had said, in line with the consistent position of our party, it is clear that the future of Nigeria can never be left in the hands of an obtrusively incompetent, insensitive, vindictive and violent happy mass of failures like the APC.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the APC and its government have no propensity for peace; it has nobody in its political den to proffer approaches for a peaceful community of people and that is why they are always running to the PDP product in President Goodluck Jonathan for peacekeeping assignments across Africa and other parts of the world. Of course, one cannot give what he doesn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unfortunate that the APC will choose to live in perpetual self-denial over its inability and failure to ensure peace, unity, orderliness and cohesion in our country.\n\n\u201cOur party wants the APC to know that while they may gag their own members, they cannot stop other well-meaning Nigerians like Governor Wike from exposing the atrocities and failures of the APC,\u201d the opposition party further added.\n\nNiger Islamiyya kidnap\n\nMeanwhile, terrorists have claimed responsibility for the kidnap of about 200 pupils of the Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Niger state.\n\nIt was gathered the terrorists made contact with the school management Monday, demanding the sum of N110 million for the release of the pupils by the end of Wednesday.\n\nHeadmaster of the institution, Abubakar Alhassan, according to report, stated that the terrorists threatened to kill the kidnapped pupils if the deadline was not met.\n\nAlhassan also said the message had been passed on to officials of the state government, who maintained that ransom would not be paid to terrorists.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mary Noel-Berje, Deputy Governor Ahmed Mohammed Ketso disclosed that the government was in pursuit of the kidnappers, and measures were being taken to ensure the safe release of the Tegina Islamic School children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t pay ransom to abductors. We are trying to negotiate to see how we can bring them back safely,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt also said the government had identified some parents of the abducted pupils and assured them of the safe return of the children.(Ripples)\n\nMatawalle orders shoot-at-sight\n\nIn a related development, Zamfara state Governor Bello Matawalle has directed the state\u2019s police and other security services to carry out President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive to shoot anyone in possession of illicit weapons.\n\nThe president issued the order March when criminal activity in the state was at an all-time high.\n\nMatawalle claimed only law enforcement personnel should be armed in a series of tweets on Wednesday.\n\nAnyone detected in unlawful possession of firearms, according to the governor, \u201cshould be shot on the spot.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration would support the security agencies with the necessary logistics to discharge their duties.\n\n\u201cThe Zamfara State Police and other government security agencies are to effectively implement the Presidential order to shoot on sight at bandits, persons or group of people seen with Ak-47 or any weapons.\n\n\u201cOnly those approved by law or the security agencies are to carry guns and other sophisticated weapons, anyone found in unlawful possession of guns should be shot on the spot.\n\n\u201cOur administration will always support the police and other security agencies with all the necessary logistics so as to discharge their duties effectively,\u201d the governor said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Secondly, I will incorporate compulsory vocation study at those two levels of education. Our young boys and girls are very enterprising and so I plan to engage them in different vocational studies at the earliest stage. Right from primary to secondary school, every child would be compelled to learn a skill because we will set up technical school ventures that will be attached to formal schools where students can learn technical skills side-by-side with their formal education. \u201cBecause of the critical state of roads in Anambra presently, I will declare a state of emergency on roads on his first day in office and a comprehensive audit of the state of the roads will be carried out in the shortest possible time and credible contractors will be engaged immediately. \u201cMy security plan will be a homegrown structure comprising all the critical stakeholders in the state with direct communication to my office as governor. I will establish an expanded state security council to which all heads of security agencies including local vigilante groups must belong and hold regular meetings to assess the security situation in the state.\n\n\u201cThirdly, I will initiate a health insurance scheme that will cover all indigenes of the state. All over the world, health insurance has become a key driver of the health sector. I believe that with a strong partnership with the best insurance companies in the country, we can give a lifeline to our people without breaking the banks.\n\n\u201cOn electricity, my focus is to ensure that businesses and households are properly powered under public-private power generation schemes. A single approach cannot guarantee my electricity target to light up Anambra, so I will adopt a multidimensional system that brings all the available options into play,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has taken a swipe at the US media giant, Twitter, saying its mission in Nigeria is suspicious.\n\nMohammed\u2019s comments came after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he issued a threat to trouble makers in the country while making reference to Nigeria\u2019s civil war.\n\nWhile defending its action, the tech company said the President\u2019s tweet violated its rules.\n\nBut briefing State House reporters at the Presidential Villa on Wednesday in Abuja, the Minister accused Twitter of ignoring inciting tweets by the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and others, adding that Nigeria would not be fooled.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Twitter Deletes Buhari\u2019s \u2018In The Language They Understand\u2019 Tweet\n\nHe recalled the #EndSARS protest during which government and private property were either looted or destroyed in October last year, noting that the company also displayed the same bias during the period.\n\nThe minister also asked what rule of Twitter President Buhari violated to warrant his tweet to be deleted, wondering why previous tweets on #EndSARS protests were taken out.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centers, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari had during a meeting with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, issued a stern warning to those plotting to destroy Nigeria, saying they will soon receive the shock of their lives.\n\nHe also condemned the series of attacks on INEC facilities, stressing that the Federal Government has given the perpetrators enough time.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail,\u201d President Buhari said.",

          "title": "Nigeria Government Protests Deletion of Buhari\u2019s Tweet, Says Twitter Can\u2019t Gag President",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Wednesday accused the social media giant, Twitter, of double standards in its treatment of issues affecting Nigeria.\n\nIt warned that it would not allow the microblogging site to dictate to President Muhammadu Buhari his views on national issues.\n\nThe accusation followed the decision of Twitter to delete a controversial post by Buhari on the Nigerian civil war.\n\nThe president, in the post on Tuesday, had warned against insurrection, saying that those fomenting trouble in the South-east are in for a rude shock.\n\nBuhari, in a series of tweets on Tuesday via his verified Twitter handle @mbuhari had said: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s statement, which was also tweeted, sparked outrage on the social media with some Nigerians reporting it to Twitter.\n\nHowever, some said the president sounded firm in his warning against perpetrators of violence in the South-east.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Twitter pulled down the tweet for violating its community standards.\n\nTwitter, in a comment, said: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, however, kicked against the decision with the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, wondering why Tweeter would object to a submission by the president on national issues but would ignore provocative postings by the leader of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu on its site.\n\nThe minister told journalist at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House, Abuja that Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is suspect.\n\nHe wondered if Twitter has ever deleted offensive tweets by Kanu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests promoted tweets trying to raise funds for the ENDSARS protesters. It was the first to close the account of former President of US, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the Capitol, it became insurrection. You see, we are not going to be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police stations, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences; is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nWhile accepting the fact that Twitter may have its own rules, Mohammed said that should not stop Buhari from expressing his views against a banned organisation like IPOB inciting people to commit arson and the likes in the South-east.\n\nHe stated: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the one guilty of double standards.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation \u2013 a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m saying that you cannot compare anybody with Kanu who boldly say, go and kill policemen. I think sometimes\u2026policemen are brothers, they are our uncle, they are children. We kill them their wives become widows, their children become orphans. And what is the offence of these policemen \u2013 because they are working to keep the country one. What about soldiers that are putting down their lives so that you and I can sleep? It is not acceptable anywhere in the world for anybody, anywhere, to stay in the comfort of wherever he is and now give directives to go and kill soldiers, go and kill policemen.\u201d\n\nAsked why Sheikh Ahmed Gumi whose comments were perceived as justifying Boko Haram actions has not been arrested, Mohammed asked who appointed Gumi as the go-between between government and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWho appointed Gumi middleman between government and Boko Haram? Listen, for me, unless you come and tell me this what Gumi said that is inciting that you are comparing to Kanu\u2026 anyway what we\u2019re discussing is different. We\u2019re discussing Twitter. If you want to ask any question about Gumi or any other person, go ahead but please, be objective,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said if government had resolved to pick up all those critical of the Buhari administration, the detention centres would have been full by now.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are so many people who have been spewing hate against Mr. President, against this governments. So if you want to comment, be fair; don\u2019t take a position, which is not objective. If we were to pick up everybody today who had been abusing this administration, the detention centres will be filled up and you will be the first person also to talk about lack of tolerance, lack of rule of law.\u201d\n\nReacting to Buhari\u2019s tweet, human rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, described as \u201cinsensitive\u201d the civil war analogy by the president.\n\nYesufu, in a video statement yesterday, said: \u201cMy name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu. I am Igbo, a threat to the Igbo people is a threat to me. Any attack on the Igbo people is an attack on me. Any malignment of the Igbo people is a malignment to me. We are all Nigerians and no Nigerian is more Nigerian than the others.\n\n\u201cThe government must ensure that it deploys its resources and its apparatus equally to every section of this country.\n\n\u201cI totally condemn the tweet from the president where the president is threatening the Igbo people. He is threatening them with what happened in 1967. What happened in 1967 was a genocide; a crime against humanity and it must never ever be allowed to happen again.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cFor a president to come out today and use 1967 as a yardstick to threaten people with what happened then, with the 30 months of gruesomeness, with the 30 months of heinousness, with the 30 months of atrocities that were meted out on human beings, on fellow brothers and sisters, on children in this country, is inhumane, it is insensitive, it is callous, and it is unspeakable.\u201d\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor, Mr. Ayodele Fayose, however, called on Twitter to hold presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu and Mohammed accountable for the controversial \u2018civil war\u2019 post.\n\nReacting in a string of tweets, Fayose wrote: \u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lai Mohammed and co (others) accountable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that the Nigerian oil and gas industry will require at least $40 billion in direct investments in basic infrastructure to achieve the federal government\u2019s much talked-about about \u201cDecade of Gas.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said the cartel\u2019s latest assessment showed that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nNNPC said yesterday that it was targeting between 7.4 billion cubic feet to 10 billion cubit feet of gas in the next couple of years, compared to its current 1.6 bcf supply capacity.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual forum organised by the Association of Local Distributors of Gas (ALDG), tagged \u201cThe Decade of Gas: Unlocking Opportunities in the Domestic Gas Market,\u201d the Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, NNPC, Mr Yusuf Usman, stated that a major constraint in achieving local content through the programme is the difficult conditions placed by foreign lenders.\n\nHowever, he stated that the corporation expects to grow about 10 gas-based industries as it works towards the 10-year target.\n\nHe added that the figure on the quantum of funds needed is based on the submissions NNPC has received from potential investors.\n\nIn addition, he stated that about 39 thermal power plants were being targeted as opposed to the current 33.\n\nAccording to him, by the end of this year, the NNPC is projecting an added gas sales of about 600 mmscfd, compared to its current 1.6 bcf to hit 2.2 bcf by the end of 2021.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn terms of benefits, we will generate 45,000 megawatts of power in terms of gas use, creating massive employment and import substitution.\n\n\u201cThere are changes we need to look at to actualise the decade of gas. We see the huge amount of investment, both Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) that will come into the country upward of $40 billion or much more than that in order to achieve all the aggressive plans that that are outlined in the decade of gas.\n\n\u201cThis investment will come in the upstream, midstream and downstream, but there are challenges as well because there have been a lot of announcements around funding for fossil fuels and these are some of the things we have to look at as we go forward and we need to figure out the announcement vis-a-vis the foreign estimate that we expect.\u201d\n\nHe added that the corporation has a supply plan to deliver up to 4.5 bcf of gas into the market, while going forward, the country expects 7.4 bcf of gas.\n\nAccording to Usman, there are urgent plans to complete ongoing gas projects in the country, including the AKK project , which he described as one of the most aggressive and biggest pipeline infrastructure ever embarked upon by the country. The pipeline spans 614 km.\n\nHe said all the gas activities going on around the country were being handled by local construction companies and local providers of services due to the COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into 10 years, we expect to do another big pipeline that will take up gas from south, all the way into Ajaokuta and possibly we extend it all the way to Maiduguri,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will be passed this year, noting that the corporation is ready to adjust to the changes that the law will impose.\n\nUsman stated that by the corporation\u2019s projection, demand for gas to generate electricity in the country will consume between 60 to 70 per cent of the entire commodity produced, with the ongoing plan to generate 45,000MW.\n\n\u201cThe other challenge we have is the liquidity in the power sector, and there\u2019s a lot of work going on because it is a very huge market. If you see the demand projections that we have done, it is going to consume 60 to 70 per cent of the gas that we have.\n\n\u201cNot only that; without power, all the development programmes we are thinking of will be a mirage. It is an inevitable equation that we have to solve to move towards development and issues around it have to be resolved,\u201d he stated.\n\nUsman urged policy makers to answer the questions surrounding gas pricing, since Nigeria is interested in using gas as a source of revenue as well as balancing between investment and local content drive.\n\n\u201cAll these FDI come with conditionality before taking the money. That will put a limit to our local content drive. As you all know, the restrictions by itself affect the kind of projections that we look at,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that if Nigeria will achieve the decade of gas, it must transit to a willing-buyer willing-seller market.\n\nBesides, there must be a document with timelines as well as defined investment strategies on the announcement that is being made about the restriction for fossil fuel to achieve the decade of gas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, has said that the cartel\u2019s latest assessment shows that capital investments in the upstream of the oil and gas industry fell by 30 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said at the first meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue that despite that, crude oil will continue to be relevant, especially in Africa.\n\nDescribing the future of Africa\u2019s oil industry as bright and the opportunities vast, Barkindo stated that the continent is currently home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world.\n\nAccording to him, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28 per cent of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25 per cent and coal at roughly 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, Barkindo stated that the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around nine per cent of world\u2019s output.\n\nHe said at the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 126 billion barrels,with Nigeria holding the lion\u2019s share with 36.9 billion barrels, representing 29 per cent of Africa\u2019s reserves.\n\nBarkindo said demand in developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, would be intensified, and all forms of energy would be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy long-term energy requirements.\n\n\u201cOne major issue looming in the long-term horizon is the lack of adequate industry investment.\n\n\u201cAccording to our latest assessments, upstream capital spending is estimated to have fallen in 2020 by a staggering 30 per cent or more.\n\n\u201cOur 2020 World Oil Outlook estimates that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\n\u201cWe must continue to advocate a turnaround in this very upsetting trend. The very future of our industry is at stake,\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy needs to ensure future demand is met, adding that policies must change in that regard.\n\nHe stated that another issue of utmost concern in Africa is the scourge of energy poverty, which continues to impact millions across the continent.\n\nCiting OPEC data, Barkindo said an estimated 47 per cent of the population in Sub Saharan Africa had no electricity and approximately 85 per cent of people lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.\n\nHe stated that considering the richness of the continent\u2019s resources, both conventional and renewable, this situation is hard to accept.\n\nHe urged all stakeholders to unite on the issues to ensure an equitable distribution of energy that leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury but a human right.\n\n\u201cOPEC will continue to work closely with our member countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue,\u201d he added.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

A majority of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly feel the same way, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe cannot postpone again,\u201d athlete-turned-politician and organising committee president Seiko Hashimoto said an interview published on Thursday by the Nikkan Sports newspaper.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga is likely to call a snap election after the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Asahi newspaper reported, showing his resolve to push ahead with the event.\n\nForeign spectators have already been barred from the Games, and officials are undecided if Japanese fans will be allowed into venues. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura pointed out on Thursday that excited fans, shouting and hugging could pose a contagion risk.\n\nTowns and cities set to host Olympic training or events have increasingly expressed misgivings, amid concern visitors will spread variant strains of the virus and drain medical resources. read more\n\nThe government of Ota City has been inundated with complaints by residents over a decision to give preferential COVID-19 vaccinations to city and hotel staff tending to Australian athletes, media reported.\n\nThe city, about 80km (50 miles) northwest of Tokyo, is the site of a training camp for Australia\u2019s softball squad, which this week became the first national team to arrive in Japan.\n\nKurume City in the southern prefecture of Fukuoka pulled out of hosting Kenya\u2019s pre-Olympics training camp, the African nation\u2019s Olympics committee said on Wednesday.\n\nA player on Ghana\u2019s Under-24 team tested positive for the coronavirus after arriving in Japan for a friendly match, the Japan Football Association (JFA) said on Thursday. And in Taiwan, the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association said it was pulling out of Olympic qualifier games in Mexico amid infection concerns.\n\nJapan is battling a fourth wave of COVID-19 eight weeks out from the scheduled start of the Games, but the country\u2019s vaccine rollout has been slow and 10 regions including Tokyo are under a state of emergency until June 20.\n\nWhile Japan has avoided the large-scale infections suffered by many other nations, severe cases are rising in the latest outbreak. More than 746,000 cases have been recorded and more than 13,000 deaths.\n\nShigeru Omi, Japan\u2019s top medical adviser, has become more vocal about concerns that he and other medical experts have about staging the Games.\n\nOn Wednesday, Omi told a parliamentary committee it would be abnormal to host the Olympics amid the current state of infections, and organisers had a responsibility to scale down the event if the situation continues.\n\nAnd on Thursday, Omi told lawmakers that guidance given to the government by public health officials, including himself, was not reaching the International Olympic Committee in charge of the event.\n\n\u201cWe are now considering where we should give our advice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to hold (the Games), it\u2019s our job to tell them what the risks are.\u201d",
          "summary": "The president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee ruled out a cancellation or further postponement of the Olympics as doubts swirled among city governments and medical professionals whether the event can be held safely amid the pandemic.\nA majority of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly feel the same way, the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper reported on Thursday.\n\u201cWe cannot postpone again,\u201d athlete-turned-politician and organising committee president Seiko Hashimoto said an interview published on Thursday by the Nikkan Sports newspaper.\nTowns and cities set to host Olympic training or events have increasingly expressed misgivings, amid concern visitors will spread variant strains of the virus and drain medical resources.\nAnd in Taiwan, the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association said it was pulling out of Olympic qualifier games in Mexico amid infection concerns.",

          "text": "NASA on Wednesday announced plans to launch two new scientific missions to Venus between 2028 and 2030 \u2014 its first in decades \u2014 to study the atmosphere and geologic features of Earth\u2019s so-called sister planet.\n\nThe United States space agency said it was awarding about $500m for development of each of the two missions, dubbed DAVINCI+ (short for Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble Gases, Chemistry and Imaging) and VERITAS (an acronym for Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography and Spectroscopy).\n\nDAVINCI+ will measure the composition of the dense Venusian atmosphere, seeking to improve understanding of how it evolved, while VERITAS will map the planet\u2019s surface from orbit to help determine its geological history and why it developed so differently than Earth, NASA said.\n\nDAVINCI+, consisting of a fly-by spacecraft and an atmospheric descent probe, is also expected to return the first high-resolution images of unique geological characteristics on Venus called \u201ctesserae.\u201d Scientists believe those features may be comparable to Earth\u2019s continents and suggest that Venus has plate tectonics, according to NASA\u2019s announcement.\n\nNASA\u2019s new administrator, Bill Nelson, announced two new robotic missions to the solar system\u2019s hottest planet during his first major address to employees on Wednesday [File: Bill Ingalls/NASA]Earth\u2019s closest planetary neighbour and the second planet from the sun, Venus is similar in structure but slightly smaller than Earth, with a diameter of about 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles).\n\nAbove its foreboding landscape lies a thick, toxic atmosphere consisting primarily of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. The consequence is a runaway greenhouse effect that bakes the surface of Venus at temperatures as high as 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 Celsius), hot enough to melt lead.\n\nVenus has lately received less scientific attention than Mars, Earth\u2019s next-closest planetary next-door neighbour, and other solar system destinations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re revving up our planetary science program with intense exploration of a world that NASA hasn\u2019t visited in over 30 years,\u201d Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA\u2019s associated administrator for science, said in a statement announcing the missions.\n\nNASA\u2019s Magellan spacecraft, which reached Venus in 1990, made the first global map of the Venusian surface as well as global maps of the planet\u2019s gravity field.\n\nIn 1994, the Magellan spacecraft was sent to plunge into the surface of Venus to gather data on its atmosphere before it ceased operations.",
