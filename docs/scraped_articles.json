          "text": ".\n\n\u2026says OMPALAN didn\u2019t speak for Niger Deltans\n\n\u2026insists on the inauguration of Senate-confirmed 2019 board\n\nBy Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nThe Coalition For Restoration of Legality in the NDDC, CFRLN, Monday, attacked the leadership of the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Landlords Association of Nigeria, OMPALAN for requesting for the constitution of a new Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC whereas the board appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari and confirmed by the Senate has been awaiting inauguration.\n\nThe group in a statement by its National President, Igonibo Danagogo and National Secretary, Ofem Okang said OMPALAN did not speak for the people of the Niger Delta region but spoke for itself.\n\nCFRLN in the statement said; \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a publication purported to have been made in the media on Sunday, August 15 2021 by a body styling itself as The Oil Mineral Producing Areas Landlords Association of Nigeria, OMPALAN, and signed by one Bishop Udo Azogu requesting Mr President to constitute a new Board for the NDDC rather than inaugurating the NDDC Board which Mr President appointed in October 2019 and confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019, and has been awaiting inauguration since then.\n\n\u201cThe said Bishop Azogu went ahead to state that the \u201cBoard that was dissolved by the President on the grounds of incompetence cannot be retained and inaugurated\u201d. This is false.\n\n\u201cThe substantive NDDC board has already been screened by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and, was, in fact, on the verge of resuming at the commission before its inauguration was put on hold for the now-concluded forensic audit to take place.\n\n\u201cWe can state authoritatively that the board of the NDDC was never dissolved by President Buhari because the board had not even been inaugurated in the first place and, even at that, a board that had not been allowed to work for even a single day could not possibly be dissolved on grounds of incompetence as claimed by the said Bishop Azogu of the so-called OMPALAN.\n\n\u201cThis publication credited to the so-called OMPALAN, is particularly dreadful in its deviation from fact and truth, even as it was a most toxic cocktail of shameful lies and barefaced falsehoods.\n\n\u201cEven more lamentable is the fact that the so-called OMPALAN is clearly a non-existent organization and obviously an exercise in political hustling being fronted by one Bishop Azogu, a self-styled prophet and man of God who had most ridiculously and highly irresponsibly once prophesied on October 1, 2020, that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo would be removed from office before 2023!\n\n\u201cThis same Azogu had in that same year 2020 also predicted victory for Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu in the last Edo Governorship election, and when Ize-Iyamu lost, he continued to Prophesy that Ize-Iyamu would still become Governor by court decision! We all know how that turned out.\n\n\u201cIt is truly sad that the likes of Azogu and phantom associations like OMPALAN are the latest ruses those hellbent on continuing with illegality and mismanagement of the collective property of the Niger Delta people would be turning to in their desperation.\n\n\u201cWe find it most unfortunate that these highly vexatious stunts are being pulled for personal aggrandizement and private gain with scant concern for the sustenance of the fragile peace of the Niger Delta region or regard for the feelings and sensibilities of its people who have had to put up with an NDDC they have neither representation in nor, accountability from.\n\n\u201cThe much-touted forensic audit, the reason given for the delay in inaugurating the NDDC board has been concluded. Mr President had assured the people of the Niger Delta that the board he had earlier constituted and had already been screened by the Senate, would be inaugurated immediately after the forensic audit was concluded.\n\n\u201cAll these truly shameful shenanigans machinated to distract our President from doing the right thing must stop forthwith and the substantive board of the NDDC immediately inaugurated as promised by President Buhari\u201d.",

It is the flag of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and it was used specifically for that function. Immediately the function was over,the flag was removed,it is the normal thing, it\u2019s a normal practice anywhere.\n\n\u201cSo,that flag has nothing to do with religion,it is about the country. It has nothing to do with solidarity with any organisation,any group or sections or any other thing other than the fact that it was the flag of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and it was only for that function,\u201dhe explained.\n\nHe spoke further:\u201dSometimes,we do not think giving response to this kind of thing is necessary but sometimes,too, much of silence may be misconstrued to mean that we are accepting the allegation that is out there in the public, otherwise,we are even reluctant to speak about it.\n\n\u201cThere is really nothing about it. We must realize that the facility these people came to support us with is for the benefit of Nigeria. So as NEMA, we now have a call centre that people in distress can call and get referrals or give support to someone that is in danger.\u201d",

Major Ishaku Takwa Military Information Officer, Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) said, \u201cThe attention of Operation SAFE HAVEN (OPSH) has been drawn to a message circulating on social media calling on Muslim youths to embark on peaceful protest slated for tomorrow, Wednesday 18 August 2021.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe message purportedly stated that the demonstration is expected to commence from Massallacin Jumaa Yan Dankali to Plateau State House of Assembly Complex.\u201d\n\nHe said, OPSH is sending a strong warning to those planning this demonstration (if it is true) and the originator of the message to have a rethink, adding that, the 24 hours curfew imposed by His Excellency the Executive Governor of Plateau State Rt Hon Simon Bako Lalong on Jos North local government and 12 hour curfew on Jos South and Bassa Local government area is still in place and we are fully deployed to ensure its enforcement.\n\n\u201cWhile, OPSH will not want to join issues with the organizers of the planned protest, it is instructive to state that in view of the fragile nature of peace on the Plateau this protest is unnecessary and uncalled for.\u201d\n\nThe statement further added that, the army is aware that Muslim clerics and leaders have distanced themselves from the planned message circulated and not in support of the peaceful demonstration, adding that, OPSH will not allow any body or group to breach the fragile peace in Jos metropolis.\n\nIt warned that, any body found acting contrary to the law will be dealt with.",

Houses were also burnt down and people rendered homeless.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe human loses due to the destruction is very worrisome as it continues to fuel the endless circle of attacks and counter attacks.\n\nLalong regretted that, while these efforts were ongoing to bring those behind the unfortunate attacks to justice, another unfortunate breach of peace along Rukuba road on Saturday 14th August 2021 where a convoy of five buses with passengers returning from a religious festival in Bauchi State heading to Ondo State were attacked.\n\nThis act he said was \u201cmost despicable\u201d which brought about the imposition of 24-hour curfew on Jos North Local Government Area in addition to the dusk to dawn curfew in Bassa and Jos South LGAs to curtail total breakdown of law and order.\n\nThe Governor charged the stakeholders to brainstorm honestly and come up with valuable suggestions as to what can be done to settle once and for all, the cycle of violence that was almost being forgotten before the recent ugly developments.\n\nAmong stakeholders who attended the meeting included: elders, past and present political office holders, representatives of CAN and JNI, PIDAN, women and youth groups as well as traditional rulers.\n\nThe meeting thereafter went into a closed-door session.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nLeading leaders from the three geopolitical zones in the North, yesterday, listed key challenges bedeviling the 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe leaders who met in Abuja, said the challenges include political, economic and social, principal among which are the collapse of traditional values, uncaring leadership, mismanagement of opportunity and inequity.\n\nThey claimed the region is sitting on a keg of gunpowder, warning that it may explode sooner than later.\n\nSome of the leaders who attended the meeting included the 1993 presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC), Ibrahim Tofa, former secretary to Government of the Federation, Yayale Ahmed, former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Attahiru Jega, former governors, ministers, senators and military officers.\n\nAddressing newsmen after the meeting, Tofa announced the formation of the Roundtable, a new group comprising independent, non-partisan and non-governmental organisations founded by eminent sons and daughters of the region to address the challenges facing the region.\n\nSpeaking on behalf the group, Tofa said it was common knowledge that the North has been facing multiple challenges over time, which has escalated into a crisis over the past few years.\n\n\u201cThese challenges are many and they cut across the region. These have manifested in the collapse of institutions and services, widespread poverty and inequality, mutual suspicion, endemic insecurity, disunity, despair and dearth of hope across the region. Every community has challenges but to overcome challenges, there is need to admit their existence.\u201d\n\nTofa said all was not well with the North and urged leaders to take responsibility and proffer solutions.\n\n\u201cWe have no difficulty admitting all is not well with Northern Nigeria and taking primary or vicarious responsibility for the current state of affairs. We must all \u2013 leaders, followers and passive onlookers \u2013 accept our share of responsibility but, beyond that, we must collectively resolve to take action and remedy what went wrong going forward.\n\n\u201cWe owe this to ourselves and to succeeding generations who I would bear the consequences of our action and inaction even though they bear no responsibility for how we got here. No parent would wish to bequeath a precarious future to his child and no price is too high to pay to secure the future of succeeding generations of Northerners.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aware attaining these objectives will not be easy as the conditions and forces of division have taken root and have been left to fester unchecked over a long period. But the journey of a thousand miles, they say, begins with a single step.\n\n\u201cWe are also hopeful that, as collective victims who have paid the price of division, our people have arrived at the realisation that unity is required to resolve other challenges afflicting the region. Recent consultations with eminent political, traditional and religious leaders across the North are encouraging.\n\n\u201cThey reveal a strong desire to remove all obstacles to Northern unity and a commitment to overcome its challenges. We will widen and deepen these consultations in the coming weeks, months and, if necessary, years in order to attain our objectives.\u201d\n\nProferring solutions to the many challenges, Tofa said: \u201cThe most urgent task, therefore, facing the peoples of Northern Nigeria is to overcome fear and suspicion, jettison unhealthy division and create consensus around common goals and aspirations. These are necessary for creating the enabling environment to address our most stubborn challenges such as insecurity, widespread poverty, collapse of institutions and services, etc so that order, peace and prosperity may once again return to our region.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who occupy this region, we are the ones who suffer the consequences of its diminution and we are the ones who must remedy the situation. It is in our common and enlightened interest to do so.\n\n\u201cWe would like to seize this opportunity to call on all stakeholders, particularly our political, business, technocratic, traditional, religious, community and youth leaders to support this initiative to recreate the entire northern landscape and make it conducive to a future worthy of succeeding generations, regardless of ethnic, sectarian and sectional considerations.\n\n\u201cA new, united, secure and prosperous North is possible but we have to work for it collectively in equity, good faith, mutual respect, love and goodwill towards each other.\u201d\n\nOn the state of insecurity, he said: \u201cThe state of insecurity across Nigeria is worrisome, but the state of insecurity in Northern Nigeria has reached existential proportions, threatening to render the region hostile to civilized existence. We acknowledge the efforts of the relevant authorities at both the state and federal levels to deal with the difficult, complex and evolving security situation but it is becoming clear on a daily basis that a lot more of these efforts is required.\n\n\u201cThe pain, agony and unwarranted suffering of ordinary people across the region has become completely unbearable as agriculture, education, commerce and the normal rhythm of life have been severely disrupted.\n\n\u201cTo bring the state of insecurity in Northern Nigeria under control, more and better collaboration among the states across the region and between the states and federal authorities is required. There is also need for more and better coordination among the military and security agencies and between them and the civilian population.\n\n\u201cHowever, the ultimate remedy to the state of insecurity in Northern Nigeria is a collective resolve by all northern communities to live in peace with each other, in equity and justice, and quality investment by the three tiers of government, as well as the private sector, in human capital, agriculture, healthcare and infrastructure, particularly power, transport and telecommunication.\n\n\u201cThese investments are necessary for job creation to catch up with our rapid growth in population. No effort should be spared to bring an end to the wanton death and destruction that have been unleashed on the region.\n\n\u201cWe cannot blame anyone for this failure but ourselves. Basic education is the responsibility of local and state authorities. In this respect, our local and state authorities have consistently failed us over the years. We are not building enough classes to cater for our population, which is growing out of control.\n\n\u201cIn most communities, the classes are exposed to the weather and not conducive to learning. Our teacher training institutions are too few and poorly funded, while teachers are at the lowest rung of the ladder in our communities and among the worst paid.\n\n\u201cSo-called basic education commissions at both the federal and state levels, have become suffocating bureaucracies with little, if any impact, on the quality of basic education in our states.\u201d",

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nThe Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, on Tuesday calmed frayed nerves with assurances that the signing of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) by President Muhammadu Buhari, Monday, may not automatically translate to a hike in pump price of petrol (premium motor spirit).\n\nSpeaking at a media briefing in Abuja, Sylva said that despite the PIA provisions on deregulation, Nigerians should await presidential details and directives on today when it would be tabled at the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nDaily Sun had on Tuesday reported that the signing of the PIB would translate to higher petrol price of about N270/litre, as Sylva had repeatedly said that the new law has no provision for subsidy currently being borne by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe Minister, however, revealed that the national oil company would be unbundled in the next six months as stipulated in the new law.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell as you know, the Act has actually deregulated the sector but that doesn\u2019t mean that there will be an immediate implementation of the deregulation.\n\n\u201cWhat the Act provides is that products will be sold at market dictated prices. But we are mindful of the fact that this will bring some hardship which is why we are not going to jump into implement it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe implementation framework will take care of that, as well as how we are going to alleviate the sufferings that this might bring.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be automatic. We have been working with labour to ensure that there is a framework that will allow us to implement this deregulation provision of the Act.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing discussions with the organised labour on subsidy removal, Sylva explained that the consultations were not yet concluded.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not just about discussing with labour, because we agreed between labour and government that we need to put a framework in place for the implementation of deregulation.\n\n\u201cBecause more or less there is consensus across the table now that deregulation is desirable. But how do we achieve it? That\u2019s the question now. Labour and government have agreed and so we are now in the process of putting the infrastructure and process in place.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOnce we are able to agree on that process with labour then we are ready to deregulate. So, we will keep it within that band (N162 \u2013 N165 per litre) for the time being\u201d.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has raised the alarm that Africa\u2019s increasing population is assuming a worsening trend.\n\nSpeaking during the public presentation of the maiden edition of the Africa Progress Group (APG) report, yesterday, he confessed that his heart sinks anytime he travels across places and sees the huge population of people \u201coozing out from nowhere.\u201d\n\nObasanjo, who is chairman of the APG, said if Africa\u2019s growing population, which he said keeps him awake at night, is managed properly, it would yield huge dividends for national and regional development.\n\n\u201cThree clusters of questions pop up in my mind any time the scary thoughts of the ever-increasing population kept me awake at night. The first cluster is: how are we going to feed this exploding population?\n\n\u201cOnly a few days ago, the alarm was raised about imminent food crisis in Nigeria. Similar alarm bells have been ringing with increasing stridency all over Africa. How are we going to house them; educate them, provide them with health security and other variants of human security?\n\n\u201cThe second cluster of questions is: how do we keep this keg of gunpowder of the large army of unemployed youth from exploding? How do we keep them from enlisting in violent extremist groups and gangs of kidnappers? The third cluster of questions is: how can Africa attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2063 in a turbulent sea of exploding, not-well-managed populations?\n\n\u201cWhile these clusters of questions are frightening, they would appear to have an elegantly simple solution \u2014 political will and action to make population an asset. This is the master key of a sort! I am sure you noticed that this \u2018key\u2019 has two elements \u2014 the will and the action.\n\n\u201cYouth unemployment rate in Africa is one of the highest in the world. African countries must urgently commit to lowering this rate through a combination of efforts including functional education, entrepreneurial training, and provision of job opportunities and the enabling environment for investment and growth of small and medium-scale enterprises.\n\n\u201cThe attention paid to education by a country is, in large part, a reflection of its responsiveness to making its growing population an asset. Education is seen as the antidote to poverty and ignorance and the direct and indirect key to unlocking human and material resources of a nation. It can be likened to the hub around which other components of development revolve, like spokes on a wheel.\u201d\n\nHe noted that youth unemployment rate in Africa could be converted into human capital that would translate into a boost for the continent\u2019s economy.",

          "text": "\u2022Senate President, Speaker, OPEC, NEITI, industry stakeholders hail new legislation\n\n\u2022PDP, PANDEF, IJC kick against Act, condemn assent, say President has demonstrated he is not a listening leader\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Emmanuel Addeh,\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\nIn a historic move yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari signed into law the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), a piece of legislation that will serve as the framework for the operations in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe legislation which has suffered several setbacks since 2008, when it was first presented to the National Assembly, aims at removing legal and regulatory uncertainties that have held back the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nThis is just as the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) and some industry players have said the PIA would positively reshape Nigeria\u2019s industry.\n\nOn the contrary, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), ljaw National Congress (INC), have expressed displeasure over the development, saying the president failed to heed to the complaints on certain areas in the law.\n\nA statement issued by the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said President Buhari assented to the Bill working from home.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWorking from home in five days quarantine as required by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 after returning from London on Friday August 13, the President assented to the Bill Monday August 16, in his determination to fulfill his constitutional duty.\n\n\u201cThe ceremonial part of the new legislation will be done on Wednesday, after the days of mandatory isolation would have been fulfilled.\n\n\u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s government is banking that the reforms will attract a greater share of global capital allocated to fossil fuel projects.\n\nThe Senate and House of Representatives had last month passed the bill, thus ending a long wait since early 2000s.\n\nBut while the Senate had approved three per cent as operating expenditure to the host communities, the House of Representatives, on its part had approved five per cent.\n\nBoth chambers had equally approved 30 per cent of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) profit share for exploration of frontier basins such as Lake Chad, Benue trough, Anambra, Dahomey (Lagos) and Gombe Basins.\n\nThe disparity in the percentage approved for the Host Communities by the two chambers resulted in the setting up of a Conference committee headed by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, to harmonise the two positions.\n\nEventually, the committee recommended three per cent to the Host Communities which both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopted and sent to the President for assent.\n\nThe presidential assent has rekindled hope that although late in coming, some part of the losses, by one estimate by NEITI exceeding $200 billion, may be recouped before big oil finally goes into extinction.\n\nWith the new law, the establishment of an Upstream Regulatory Commission to oversee upstream petroleum operations, including technical, operational and commercial activities and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing upstream petroleum operations, will soon be set up.\n\nIt will also see the transformation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) into a profit-oriented company devoid of political interferences.\n\nAdded to that, is the establishment of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority which would be responsible for the technical and commercial regulation of midstream and downstream petroleum operations in the petroleum industry in Nigeria.\n\nThe new law will see the deregulation of the sector and ensure strict environmental implementation of policies, laws and regulations for midstream and downstream petroleum operations; and to develop and enforce a framework on tariff and pricing for natural gas and petroleum products.\n\nWith the signing of the bill into law, NNPC now becomes commercialised as Nigerians will have the opportunity to buy shares in the business and ensure more transparency in its operations.\n\nSenate, Gbajabiamila Say Legislation Positive for Nigeria\u2019s Economy\n\nThe Senate described the new PIA as a major victory that has the potential of bailing Nigeria out of its economic predicament.\n\nAccording to the upper legislative chamber, the Act will also enable the country to make the most of economic gains of the oil industry for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\nChairman of the Senate committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, in a statement congratulated the Executive arm of government, the leadership and members of the National Assembly and all other stakeholders in the oil industry for the realization of the new Act.\n\nHe noted that efforts at reaching this stage had been a protracted affair as the Bill, first initiated in 2003 had been subjected to a ping pong affair between the previous legislatures and the Executive.\n\nAccording to him, the Ninth National Assembly finally broke the jinx when it recently passed the Bill after working dispassionately by putting the interest of the nation first over petty squabbles and other self-interests, thereby laying finally to rest previous failed attempts.\n\nThe Senate spokesman further attributed the success of the accent to the bill to the cooperative efforts of all participating sectors in the process and also the non-confrontational policy of the current National Assembly.\n\nOn benefits of the new law, Basiru said the PIA will juice up the national economy by liberalising the petroleum sector which will pave way for investors, both local and international, to invest in the oil sector with government on a competitive basis.\n\nIn his contribution, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, also hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to the PIA, saying Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry will now receive a breath of fresh air and allow investments and transparency to flourish.\n\nGbajabiamila, in a statement, noted that the coming into being of the law was a victory for Nigerians and a landmark achievement that ended the two-decade-long journey.\n\nAccording to him, when massive investments come in as a result of the PIA, many Nigerians will gain employment.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with the law, Nigerians would also benefit from reduced fuel prices as there would be competition among the industry players.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs I said before, this is a landmark achievement. It has been 20 years in coming. This ninth Assembly will be recorded on the right side of history for this big score. I call on investors to take full advantage of the opportunities that the new law provided.\u201d\n\nOPEC: Buhari Has Ushered in New Era for Oil Sector\n\nThe Secretary General, OPEC, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, in a statement congratulated President Buhari, saying it marked significant milestone for Nigeria\u2019s oil industry and an historic achievement for the Presidency.\n\nAccording to Barkindo, with the stroke of a pen, the president has inaugurated a new era for the industry following years of legislative efforts to strengthen the legal, regulatory, fiscal and governance framework of the petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the new law will enhance the Nigerian petroleum industry\u2019s reputation, open the door to new investment, and ultimately strengthen its position to meet the world\u2019s growing demand for energy. The enactment of this legislation is especially timely as the investment outlook becomes clouded by efforts aimed at accelerating a lower-carbon future.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the new law will help harness Nigeria\u2019s potential to achieve its programme of raising oil production to four million barrels per day and oil reserves to 40 billion barrels, while also drawing on the country\u2019s vast natural gas reserves to provide clean and efficient energy.\n\n\u201cIn addition, these resources will be vital to supplying world markets with a broad portfolio of energy options, and support global efforts to alleviate energy poverty as outlined in the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal 7,\u201d the OPEC scribe added.\n\nHe noted that the signing into law of the legislation also coincided with another significant milestone in Nigeria\u2019s history \u2013 the 50th anniversary of Nigeria\u2019s Membership of OPEC.\n\nAccording to Barkindo, the golden moment provides a unique opportunity to reflect upon Nigeria\u2019s rise as a global energy supplier and partner.\n\n\u201cSince the 24th OPEC Conference on 12 July 1971, when Nigeria received a unanimous and enthusiastic welcome as the 11th Member Country of the Organisation, our country has come to symbolise Africa\u2019s within OPEC and its pivotal support for global oil market stability.\n\n\u201cExcellency, the past year has been a time of enormous challenges for our world, for our Organisation, and for each Member Country. Yet throughout this difficult period, we have demonstrated the enduring importance of OPEC and its timeless commitment to dialogue, cooperation, multilateralism and respect among all nations,\u201d he added.\n\nNEITI: Law Has Ended Uncertainty of Future of Nigeria\u2019s Oil Sector\n\nIn its assessment, NEITI also described the development as historic.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NEITI, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, in a statement, noted that the new law has ended decades of uncertainty concerning the future of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nAccording to Orji, \u201cThe new law has opened a new phase of wider opportunities in the oil and gas industry. For us in NEITI, President Buhari has broken new grounds, created new business horizon built on healthy legal frameworks that will push the boundaries of reforms in the sector with realistic optimism for inflow of investments, revenue growth and job opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe transparency boss applauded the significance of the Presidential assent to the Bill, adding that NEITI looks forward to playing active roles in designing a new future for Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry under the new Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cThe signing into Law of the PIB has demonstrated government\u2019s resolve to strengthen governance processes and systems especially in the extractive industry through an institutional and legal framework. NEITI is encouraged by the development,\u201d he added.\n\nThe NEITI Executive Secretary expressed delight that the, \u201cPetroleum Industry Law will provide the dynamic legal governance framework required to re-position Nigeria\u2019s Petroleum industry to fully embrace competition, openness, accountability, professionalism and better profit returns on investments to both companies and government.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cI want to also use this opportunity to call on companies, government agencies and civil society involved in the oil and gas sector governance to give this Law a chance to succeed. NEITI as an agency with legitimate interest in the Law will carefully study the contents of the new Law and work closely with national and global partners especially the EITI to use the Law to open the Nigeria oil and gas sector for transparency, accountability and inflow of foreign direct investments into Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIndustry Stakeholders Say Legislation Big Win for Nigeria\n\nIn his reaction to the promulgation of the new law, Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Oil and Gas Trainers Association of Nigeria (OGTAN), Dr. Mayowa Afe, told THISDAY that it was a happy day for the industry and a big win for the country.\n\nThe former President, Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE) and current President, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers (EAGE), explained that aside the argument over the three per cent or five per cent for host communities, the law is a foundation that can be built upon in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news that the president has come all the way from his holiday and on his first day of work assented to the bill. It is good news for all of us. It has been there for 20 years although it\u2019s not perfect. No law is perfect, but we can begin to work on it from here, particularly the three per cent or five per cent for the communities.\n\n\u201cNow, we have a law regulating the oil and gas industry and the ones that are not up to what we want, we begin to work on it and there will be a lot of advocacy concerning this. So, it is a good day for all of us.\n\n\u201cFor investors, those who are bringing their money into the country, they now know what they are bargaining for and the communities will know what to expect. I am happy, the industry is happy.\n\n\u201cNow every company knows what they are working against, because there is now a regulation and a framework, so I can put my money there. It\u2019s different from a situation where people didn\u2019t really know what was going on, no regulation and those we had were archaic, he stressed.\n\nIn his remarks, President of the Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Dr. Billis Gillis-Harry, stated that although the law was largely unfair to the Niger Delta, it wasn\u2019t a bad place to lay a solid foundation for the sector.\n\nHe noted that the country\u2019s scarce resources that were being used to fund the petrol subsidy regime will now be used for developmental purposes, saying that the organisation had always supported deregulation.\n\n\u201cAs for the three per cent, it is unfair to the Niger Delta that bears the burden of oil production in the country to be so unfairly treated.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare this to 30 per cent of NNPC profits even as a private company, being reserved for the frontier exploration, it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cHowever, bills are made by man. I believe that at the right time some factors should change, but I congratulate Nigerians that this bill has been passed, though it had been jinxed for a number of years. It\u2019s a landmark event,\u201d he stated.\n\nChairman, Petroleum Technology Associated of Nigeria (PETAN), Mr. Nicholas Odinuwe, in his remarks expressed joy that the bill had been signed into law, adding that the views of the organisation were taken into consideration in the process of consultations.\n\n\u201cThe president has signed the PIB and there\u2019s no comment from me that will change anything. We are happy that our views were taken into consideration. We are happy, so let the bill work for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, a Niger Delta activist and the National President, Niger Delta Nonviolence Agitators Forum (NDNAF), Wisdom Ikuli, hailed President Buhari\u2019s prompt signing into law of the legislation.\n\nIkuli, said the action of the President showed his high level of responsibility and responsiveness and a further confirmation of his proactive and compassionate disposition especially to the plights of the over exploited people of the Niger Delta and the Oil Producing Communities in particular.\n\nPDP, PANDEF, Others Kick\n\nBut despite the accolades that have been heaped on Buhari over the new oil and gas law, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has berated the president.\n\nAccording to the political party, the president ignored the outcry by Nigerians across board not to sign the law, describing it as offensive, repugnant and anti-people.\n\nThe party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the signing of the law, despite widespread public rejection, amounted to endorsement of imposition, saying it further confirmed that, \u201cPresident Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) have no iota of respect for the people as well as the tenets of democracy as a system of government.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cBy his action, President Buhari has only authenticated that he is not a listening leader and that the APC and its leaders are only out to trample on the will of Nigerians for their selfish interests.\n\n\u201cIn putting his hands to endorse the obnoxious bill, even with its distasteful, paltry and provocative three per cent revenue to oil producing communities, President Buhari and the APC have again displayed disdain and insensitivity to the sufferings of the people of the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said the President could have returned the bill to the National Assembly with a request that it was made to address the demands of the oil producing communities.\n\nIt added: \u201cOur party fears that the new law cannot guarantee the desired stability and development in the oil and gas sector as well as respite in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cIf anything, the Act as signed by President Buhari is a dangerous recipe for avoidable crisis in the sector.\u201d\n\nThe PDP called on President Buhari to salvage the situation by immediately forwarding an amendment bill to the National Assembly to reflect the true wishes and aspirations of every segment of the nation.\n\nWhile calling for calm across the country, particularly the South-South geo-political zone, the PDP also charged lawmakers elected on its platform to be at alert even as preparation must be commenced for an urgent amendment to this law.\n\nAlso, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) faulted Buhari\u2019s assent signing of the bill into law, describing it as unfortunate especially with the public outcry associated with the passage of the bill by the National Assembly.\n\nIt stated that the Niger Delta people may have no option but to take a position on the issue which include seeking political as well as legal response to the issue at stake.\n\nThe group in a statement by its spokesman, Ken Robinson, wondered why President Buhari assented to the bill to become law despite condemnation of some of its provisions including the paltry three per cent provision for the Host Communities Development Trust Fund and the appropriation of 30 per cent of NNPC Limited\u2019s profit for the Frontier Oil Exploration Fund.\n\nAccording to the group, the law fell short of the expectations of the Oil and Gas Producing Communities, which bear the brunt of unconscionable industry operations.\n\nIt further stated: \u201cThis assent, by President Buhari, simply speaks to the repugnant attitude of disregard, propelled by arrogance, disdain and contempt with which issues concerning the Niger Delta Region are treated, particularly, by the present Administration.\n\n\u201cWhat this act signifies is an unequivocal message to the Niger Delta people that how they feel and what they say, do not count, at all, in the Schemes of the Nigerian Project.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s insensitive, abominable and afar every boundary of proper Democratic practice, and, therefore, unacceptable to the good people of the Niger Delta, the critical economic nexus of the entire Nigerian territory.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people will speak, shortly, after full consultations, on this callous act, on the best legal and political response.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the ljaw National Congress (INC) said it remains resolute on its earlier stance on the minimum acceptable allocation of 10 per cent to the oil bearing communities as compensation for the various degrees of damages suffered in course of oil and gas production in the area.\n\nThe president of the umbrella body of Ijaws worldwide, Prof. Benjamin Okaba, said with President Buhari\u2019s assent, their next line of action after the passage of paltry three per cent would be announced after further consultations with critical stakeholders within and outside the region.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Terror-linked Buhari's Minister, Pantami Bribes Information Tech Agency Board Members With Foreign Trip To Support ICT\u2014Killer Bill",
          "text": "Sources in the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) have revealed how the Federal Minister of Communications and Digital Economy of Nigeria, Isa Ali Pantami, bribed officials within the agency to enforce a bill targeted at destroying ICT startups in the country.\n\nSources who spoke with SaharaReporters, stated that the minister has been putting in effort to destroy the technology sector and impose his fundamentalist ideals on the works of other agencies.\n\nIsa Pantami\n\nPantami\u2019s past call to Jihad and unalloyed support for murderous groups like the Taliban and Al-Qaeda portray him as a dyed-in-the-wool Islamic fundamentalist. Yet, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Pantami as communications minister to control the country\u2019s massive data and telephone infrastructure and other sensitive details of national intelligence.\n\nThe President also recently stood by the minister after his past support for terrorist groups became public knowledge.\n\n\"This jihad is an obligation for every single believer, especially in Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 Pantami said in one of his vicious preachings in the 2000s. \u201cOh God, give victory to the Taliban and al-Qaeda (Allahumma\u2019 n\u1e63ur \u1e6c\u0101lib\u0101n wa-tan\u1e93\u012bm al Q\u0101\u2018ida).\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters, however, learnt that Pantami recently took members of the board of NITDA to Turkey, in a bid to bribe them to get his controversial bill to scale through.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cPantami tries to destroy technology sector and systematically encroach on works of other agency.

This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement.

          "title": "Nigerian startup checks out of Afghanistan post Taliban takeover",
          "text": "Yesterday, a horrific video from Afghanistan broke the internet. Hundreds of Afghans, in a desperate bid to flee the country, were captured in the footage running after and clinging to the body of a US Air Force plane as it prepared to depart Kabul airport.\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban hijacked the government and assumed total control of the capital city\u2014 it wasn\u2019t long before they had the whole country to themselves. The central government was disbanded; Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan fled the scene unannounced, leaving what remained of his administration in the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nAfghani citizens aren\u2019t the only ones affected by the current crisis. African entrepreneurs and skilled workers who run operations in Kabul are also dealing with the consequences of the Taliban\u2019s actions. How are they coping with this heat? Are they packing their loads and fleeing or are they staying put to see where the leaf drops?\n\nLast year Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega, former senior reporter, TechCabal, interviewed Vincent, a Nigeria Cybersecurity expatriate working out of Kabul, who described Afghanistan as a city on the edge, an unstable mountainous city with two presidents.\n\nMore recently, Chekkit, a Nigerian authentication and product tracking startup, expanded to Afghanistan after landing a partnership with the Afghanistan Ministry of Health to help in combating the endemic counterfeit medicine products in the country.\n\nIn a conversation with Tosin Adelowo, Chekkit CMO, I asked: why Afghanistan? Tosin disclosed that the country was urgently looking for a solution to the counterfeit market plaguing its cities and streets and \u201cChekkit has the perfect solution to the problem\u201d and that, alongside other brokering factors, is a major determinant of the expansion.\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Chekkit\u2019s drug verification solution in collaboration with their blockchain partner, Fantom Foundation (which was the major broker of the deal), the Afghanistan Ministry of Health announced the rollout of the service nationally on the 2nd of May 2021.\n\nNow, a little over three months later, Chekkit is pulling the plug on all its operations in Afghanistan. Their exit wasn\u2019t much of a decision as all their partners have been forced to exit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have discontinued our communication/operation in the region as our partners have also exited the region due to the civil unrest,\u201d Adelowo told TechCabal in an email. \u201dOur heart is with the people of Afghanistan and we pray for strength for them to withstand and surpass the current issues.\u201d\n\nChekkit\u2019s exit is just the beginning of a series of backward movements that are expected to happen in Afghanistan as a result of this unrest. And in the absence of Chekkit\u2019s solutions, and similar solutions in the market, there\u2019s a likelihood that counterfeit products will return with unchecked and unverified vengeance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSince the takeover, different analyses have been released on the impact it will have on trade and economy of the country. According to Times Now, the Afghan economy has been reliant on international aid with a limited private sector. Nearly half (around 44%) of its workforce is in agriculture. Observers predict that with the Taliban in control, international trade will come to a standstill, leading to a surge in smuggling.\n\nThe prediction is already happening, we can see that international businesses and organisations are already closing shops and evacuating their people.

          "title": "Iyin Aboyeji, Caleb Zipperstein, on why Future Africa is opening an office in Israel",
          "text": "Last week, a former associate director with leading Isreali VC OurCrowd Caleb Zipperstein, announced his appointment as a venture partner with Future Africa, and the launch of their Israeli office. This was a bit of a surprise as most local startups or funds have historically looked to Europe or Asia, as alternative sources of capital. So we sat down with Future Africa co-founder Iyin Aboyeji and Caleb to get some insight behind the move.\n\nAdegoke: Iyin. You have a reputation of being ahead of the curve and spotting the next best startup idea or trend so I\u2019m curious. Why are you opening an office in Tel Aviv, Israel? When everyone else is looking to the West then maybe Asia, for capital?\n\nIyin: The first reason is Caleb. You can\u2019t go to Israel without a professional like Caleb to support you both in terms of his political savvy with the existing prime minister\u2019s office and experience and numbers with Israeli VC OurCrowd which is a firm that is tailored after ours. Working with Caleb was the first direction. I think we would have worked with Caleb anywhere he was in the world.\n\nThe other benefit is when we think of the kind of challenges we face here, from security to agriculture, I think there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the Israeli venture community. We are in the US you know. So it\u2019s not a question of us looking away from the West but really looking in places where others wouldn\u2019t, to find a new class of limited partners (LPs).\n\nAdegoke: What does the current state of ecosystem relationship between Africa and Israel look like and where will Future Africa take that relationship to?\n\nIyin: There\u2019s been a long history, maybe hidden, when it comes to things like cybersecurity. A lot of us know Cybersun. That\u2019s an Israeli firm in Nigeria. Even agriculture. A lot of drip irrigation technology that is used across the country is Israeli tech.\n\nCaleb: Yeah. Netafim. In fact, they announced last year a $60 million deal or something like that with Rwanda. Tala communications which is in Kenya raised from an Israeli VC. Zipline raised from an Israeli VC. There are lots of collaborations. Today, Israel has three direct flights to Addis Ababa and their schedules were barely altered during the pandemic.\n\nIyin: My mindset is there are hidden relationships between the Nigerian and Israeli tech communities. It\u2019s not at an all-time high though. So there\u2019s an opportunity for us to really build that with Caleb in Israel, get more Israeli LPs, people that are very optimistic about technology and its use for solving real problems. And we\u2019re not stopping with Tel Aviv. At the moment, we\u2019re having conversations about an office opening in Dubai and London. We\u2019re going to be scaling Future Africa very fast around the world and building this global investment firm that\u2019s focused on Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAdegoke: How did you meet Caleb?\n\nIyin: I had this bunch of really interesting calls with Caleb. He reached out to me when he was thinking about moving to Rwanda during the pandemic to learn about and explore the innovation and VC ecosystem in Africa. We met online and started talking a lot and I told him that a good way for him to get involved would be to work with us especially around investor success. This is because he comes with that understanding of how to get investors infectiously excited about Africa.\n\nCaleb Zipperstein\n\nAdegoke: I agree! Caleb is always enthusiastic every time I speak with him.\n\nIyin: Yeah. That\u2019s the kind of energy we need in our firm to bring more investment into Africa.\n\nAdegoke: How would you characterize the Israeli ecosystem in terms of the size of investments, the biggest startups, or entrepreneurs?\n\nCaleb: What\u2019s going on in the Israeli ecosystem is that the economy is maturing. We\u2019re seeing more unicorns and growth deals than ever before. There were 19 IPOs last year. We\u2019re not seeing less private capital coming into the country but we\u2019re seeing a little bit less of early-stage investing. I\u2019m a little bit curious if this then presents some market opportunity for investors who are looking for early-stage deals. Through the pandemic, Israelis have these key hidden records in fundraising. We\u2019ve had more unicorns, Lemonade, and two companies\u2019 IPO recently. The former commander of the Israeli Mossad, the most elite secret service spy agency in the world, was just hired to be Israel\u2019s representative for SoftBank. It\u2019s crazy what is happening within the tech ecosystem in terms of big solutions. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister was a cybersecurity entrepreneur and an investor. The former mayor of Jerusalem made his money as an early investor in Checkpoint Cybersecurity. Generally, through the pandemic, the Israeli tech ecosystem has grown, the values have grown, the companies have matured. Now the question really is how this affects the early stage landscape. Israel will always be entrepreneurial, innovative, looking to solve problems. I\u2019m interested in if there\u2019ll be more opportunities for collaboration with neighbouring markets, which in this case would include Africa.\n\nAdegoke: Outside of Israel, which market would you say receives most of Israeli tech investment?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019d say Silicon Valley. VCs like Ribbit Capital. I think Ribbit led the last round in ChipperCash. So there could be a really interesting Israeli-African connection. I\u2019m really hoping that Israeli innovators will look to Africa and also that Israeli startups, growth companies, and corporate venture funds in Israel will be working closely with Future Africa and its portfolio companies. There\u2019s a huge fintech following but there are not enough jobs for Israelis. There\u2019s room for more great fintech but seeing the fintech boom in Africa, we think there could be some great ways for talent exchange and collaboration.\n\nAdegoke: Is the predominant investment thesis in Israel similar to what we have here? Beyond key sectors like fintech, do you see investors putting their money in other business areas?\n\nCaleb: Israel is not a B2C market. We\u2019ve also very recently have become more of a scale-up market. There are many startups that were sold for hundreds of millions of dollars before they were even selling a single product. In Africa, the way to become a unicorn is to have a great product, management team, execution. I think the potential ways in which Israel is.\n\nIyin: Caleb\u2019s remit is going to go beyond Israel. So the presence in Israel is just a part of the full picture. We want to be visible to investors, particularly to those that can add a lot of value to our portfolio. And this is where we may be looking for partnerships and solutions. Like in Dubai, there\u2019s a whole bunch of companies coming particularly from Europe who leverage Israel as their premier headquarters. Caleb\u2019s going to be working with us across the world, with our investors. We currently have over 300 investors from across the world. And we\u2019re looking to further scale our presence for investors all over the world \u2013 from current offices in the U.S., Tel Aviv, and Lagos, with plans to set up in London, Dubai, etc, \u2013 and we\u2019re hiring quite a number of people for the expansion.\n\nAdegoke: Nice! How do you plan to sell the African story to entrepreneurs and investors?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019m going to show them articles on TechCabal which have been showing stories about big rounds in companies, startups reaching unicorn status, Paystack getting sold, Flutterwave creating the impact that they\u2019ve had, and reaching business milestones that they\u2019ve had. The numbers don\u2019t lie. The number of deals in Africa is growing year over year \u2013 literally at an out-of-control pace. And early investors in those deals have been able to benefit demonstrably from those wins which is the embodiment of VC \u2013 high risk, high reward. Honestly, I cannot think of a better person to introduce the African VC ecosystem to this country than E because of his experience as an entrepreneur and an investor.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "States may wait longer for appellate court to decide on VAT",
          "text": "Nigerian states will no doubt wait longer than expected for the Appeal Court to decide on whether it is truly the states and not the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) that should collect Value Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT).\n\nRecently, the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt and presided over by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam declared that it was the Rivers State government and not the FIRS that should collect VAT and PIT in the state.\n\nThe Rivers State government had among others urged the court to declare that, by virtue of the provisions of items 7 and 8 of the Part II (Concurrent Legislative List) of the Second Schedule of the Constitution, the power of the Federal Government to delegate the collection of taxes can only be exercised by the State Government or other authority of the state and no other person.\n\nBut not satisfied with the court decision in Rivers State, the FIRS appealed the judgment, saying it had sought an injunction pending appeal and a stay of execution of the said judgment.\n\n\u201cIf the judgment is enforced or upheld on appeal, it will apply to other states and not just Rivers State. This means each state would administer VAT within their territory. By implication, FIRS will administer VAT within the FCT and non-import foreign VAT while the Nigeria Customs Service will continue to collect import VAT on international trade,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, fiscal policy partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC.\n\nRead also: Ardova grows pre-tax profit by 129% in half year\n\nVAT was introduced via Decree No.102 of 1993. It replaced sales tax operated under Decree No.7 of 1986, which was administered by states and the FCT. By contrast, VAT is administered by the FIRS and the revenue is shared among all three levels of government. Both VAT and sales tax fall under the category of consumption tax.\n\nCurrently, Section 40 of VAT Act requires that the VAT pool be shared 15 percent to the Federal Government; 50 percent to states, and 35 percent to LGs (net of 4% cost of collection by the FIRS). 20 percent of the pool is shared based on derivation.\n\n\u201cIt will be necessary to amend the Constitution to address the current challenges while retaining the positives under the current system. For instance, states will have to rely on the Federal Government to enforce the Significant Economic Presence requirement for global tech companies. Ultimately, Nigeria can learn from other climes, but we must figure out our most suitable form of fiscal federalism,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nHe believes that the Federal High Court of Rivers State judgment may also have implications for taxes collectible by Local Governments, \u201cwhich are currently administered by States as well as the amendment via Finance Act 2020, which introduced Electronic Money Transfer levy in place of stamp duties, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, complications may arise for businesses including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who may have to deal with multiple tax authorities for VAT purposes and consequently a decline in Nigeria\u2019s ease of paying taxes and doing business ranking.\n\n\u201cIronically, the biggest losers will be the states except Lagos. A few states like Kano, Rivers, Oyo, Kaduna, Delta and Katsina may experience minimal impact, while at least 30 states which account for less than 20% of VAT collection will suffer significant revenue decline. The federal government may in fact be better off given that FCT generates the second highest VAT (after Lagos) in addition to import and non-import foreign VAT,\u201d Oyedele noted.\n\n\u201cAs the decision is being appealed and in view of the pending applications for injunction and stay of execution, which the FIRS has filed in court against the judgement, members of the public are advised to continue to comply with the VAT obligations until the matter is resolved by the appellate courts in order to avoid accruing the consequent penalties and interest for non-compliance,\u201d FIRS said in a statement by its director, communications and liaison department, Abdullahi Ahmad.\n\n\u201cFrom the foregoing decisions, it is evident that this is not the first time that the VAT Act has been declared unconstitutional. As an Institute, we were waiting for the appellate courts to take a definite position on the matter before making our comments.\n\n\u201cIn view of the length of time that it takes for an appeal to be determined in our country, we think it will be in the public interest not to wait any longer\u201d, according to Adefisayo Awogbade, registrar/chief executive, Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN).\n\n\u201cAs soon as we receive the certified true copy of the judgement, our legal advisers will study it and advise us accordingly. When that is done in the next few weeks, the Institute will take an informed position and the public will be duly communicated.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful of our statutory mandate as the only Institute that controls and regulates the tax profession and tax practice in all its ramifications, and we will not shirk our responsibility to the public in all matters relating to taxation in Nigeria,\u201d CITN said in a recent statement made available to BusinessDay on the judgment of The Federal High Court in suit between the Attorney General of Rivers State versus FIRS and The Attorney General of the Federation.",

          "title": "N1.8trn recovered loot, N450bn assets: 36 states drag FG to Supreme Court, allege diversion",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), a platform for all the 36 state governors, has dragged the federal government to the Supreme Court over alleged illegal diversion of over N1.8 trillion recovered loot.\n\nThe governors also accused the federal government of diverting another N450 billion worth of non-cash assets recovered proceeds of crime since 2015.\n\nThey claimed that rather than paying the cash into the Federation Account, the federal government illegally diverted it into the Consolidated Revenue Accounts (CRA) and other accounts not recognised by the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe governors\u2019 position was made known in an affidavit deposed to by NGF Director-General Asishana Okauru, on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n\nA \u201ccommon pool of all revenues of the federation of Nigeria\u201d, the Federation Account houses the funds that are meant to be shared among the federating units based on agreed revenue sharing formula, the plaintiffs pointed out in the affidavit filed in support of the suit.\n\nOn the other hand, the CRA, according to the plaintiffs, is the account into which the federal government\u2019s share from the Federation Account, other federal earnings, and funds belonging to specific state governments are paid.\n\nOther federal earnings payable to the CRAs include receipts from federal government licenses and land revenue, administrative fees, earnings and sales, rent of government property, interests from federal government investments, repayments from state governments, Personal Income Tax of Armed Forces, and others.\n\nThey contended that the funds in the CRAs strictly belonging to the federal government and specific states are not distributable among the federating units.\n\n\u201cWhen funds are allocated from the Federation Account to the Federal or State Governments as the case may be, they are transferred to the respective Consolidated Revenue Accounts from which appropriation for government expenditure is made by an Appropriation Act or a Supplementary Appropriation Act, whichever the case,\u201d the supporting affidavit added.\n\nCiting sections 162 (1), 162 (10) and 80 of the Nigerian constitution and section 2 of the Finance (Control and Management) Act, 1958, the plaintiffs argued that recovered funds qualify as revenue payable to the Federation Account instead of the Consolidated Revenue Account of the federal government.\n\nTherefore, it is \u201cunconstitutional to remit or divert revenue payable into the Federation Account to the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or any other account whatsoever, or to apply the said revenue to any other purpose,\u201d they further submitted.\n\nThey are therefore asking for the remittance of N1.8 trillion (cash) and N450billion (non-cash) in recovered loot since 2015 into the federation account.\n\nThey are also asking for a detailed account of the recovered assets not remitted into the Federation Account by the Muhammadu Buhari administration, as well as all the relevant officials and agencies of government.\n\nThey also asked the apex court to compel the federal government through the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) to design the modalities for distributing recovered assets among the federating units.\n\nThe state governments, whose legal team is led by widely known Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, filed the suit with far-reaching implications on the handling of forfeited assets in Nigeria at the Supreme Court on June 16, 2021.\n\nThe court document cited Monday, has the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, representing the federal government, as the sole defendant in the suit marked, SCN/CV/393/2021.\n\n\u2018How Buhari violates Nigerian constitution\u2019\n\nA legal action spearheaded by the NGF led by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state and supported by all the 36 state governors across party lines, the suit accuses President Buhari of various constitutional breaches in his handling of the forfeited assets.\n\nThe plaintiffs said, while claiming to be promoting his anti-corruption agenda, Buhari \u201chas consistently contravened the provisions of the Constitution, violated the rights of the states and abused the Federal Government\u2019s position as trustee of the Federation Account\u201d.\n\nThey accused him of committing these violations \u201cby diverting funds meant for the Federation Account into other accounts owned and operated by the federal government, including the Consolidated Revenue Accounts, and applied the said revenues for the sole benefit of the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nThey also attributed more constitutional violations to the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulation, 2019, made by the Buhari administration through the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nContrary to the constitutional provisions, the plaintiff argued, the Regulation \u201cestablishes the Federal Government of Nigeria Asset Recovery Account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria and prescribes that all proceeds from the Final Forfeited Assets should be paid into the said account\u201d.\n\nThey added that the Regulation also establishes the Interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which all funds belonging to other tiers, or forfeited to other tiers shall be paid into.\n\n\u201cBy establishing the Asset Recovery Account and interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which revenue from recovered assets is to be paid, the Asset Recovery Regulation contradicts the provisions of the Constitution. The Honorable Attorney General of the Federation has also acted beyond his constitutional powers,\u201d they said further.\n\nDiverted recovered loot\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that since 2015, \u201cnumerous recoveries of illegally acquired assets have been secured through anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies\u201d, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Police Force and the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nBetween 2015 till date, they said, the federal government has secured both international and municipal forfeiture, recovery and repatriation of stolen assets, including a total sum of N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73.\n\nOther such recovered assets, according to the plaintiffs include, about 167 properties, 450 cars, 300 trucks and cargoes, and 20, 000,000 barrels of crude oil worth over N450 billion, according to the state governments.\n\nThey, however, said the President, through his ministers and anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies \u201chave failed to remit the receipts, proceeds or income derived from the recovered assets to the Federation Account as constitutionally required\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has consistently diverted these funds to other purposes, including payment into its Consolidated Revenue Account for its sole benefit,\u201d Mr. Otauru said in the supporting affidavit.\n\n\u201cWhere revenues payable into the Federation Account have been illegally diverted into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or applied to any other contrary purpose by the Federal Government, the illegally diverted revenue must be repaid, and the repayment is charged on the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or its share of allocation from the Federation Account,\u201d the plaintiffs argued further.\n\nPrayers\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to grant them 13 specific prayers.\n\nThese include, a declaration that \u201cby the provisions of Section 162(1) and Section 162(10) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended), all income, returns, proceeds or receipts howsoever described derived from confiscated, forfeited and/or recovered assets constitute revenue of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which must be remitted to Federation Account for the collective benefit of the Federal, State and Local Governments\u201d.\n\nThe plaintiffs also urged the court to declare that the failure and/or refusal of the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office and the Accountant General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the federation to remit the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and forfeited into the Federation Account to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended)among the Federal, State and Local Governments is unconstitutional.\n\nThey sought, among others, an order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office, the Accountant General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the Federation to give an account of the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and/or forfeited to the The Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe assets the plaintiffs asked the apex court to compel the officials to account for include N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) ,which were not remitted to the Federation Account in line with Section 162 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs also sought another order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF, the Accountant General of the Federation and all other relevant officials and agencies \u201cto remit\u201d the N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) into the Federation Account immediately.\n\nThey also asked the apex court to direct Mr Buhari and the officials and aforementioned officials and agencies, including the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) \u201cto determine forthwith, the modalities for distributing the receipts from seized, forfeited and recovered assets among the Federal, State and Local Government from the Federation Account\u201d.\n\nNext stage\n\nThe Supreme Court is the court of original jurisdiction on disputes between the federal government and the federating units.\n\nAnd being a constitutional matter, it will be heard by a full panel of seven Justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut as of Tuesday, the federal government, through the office of the AGF has yet to file its defence. (Premium Times)\n\nMalami reacts\n\nBut in a reaction, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, SAN, said the recovered stolen funds were governed by \u201cconflict of laws\u201d principles and not local legislation, explaining that its workability entails multiple sovereignties.\n\nThe AGF spoke Tuesday in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu in Abuja.\n\nHe said \u201cthe international recoveries are more or less governed by international conventions, negotiations and agreement of parties. It is never a straightjacket application of local legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, questions of recovery of stolen funds from indicted public officers are appropriately dealt with by other relevant laws,\u201d the statement clarified.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, misleading to give the impression that such recoveries and usage of stolen funds and stashed abroad are provided for by the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission Act.\n\n\u201cOne cannot situate rights and entitlements on looted funds and recovered assets with myopic and narrow understating of concepts of the application of local legislations.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and the purpose of setting the record straight, the application of the looted funds can only be factored within the context of mutual understanding and negotiations of international and multifaceted jurisdictional and territorial legislative issues.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of stolen assets and the subsequent uses to which these funds may be employed are subject to international agreements between Nigeria and the affected countries, thereby bringing conflict of laws into contemplation.\n\n\u201cImportantly also, these repatriated funds are based on cooperation and mutual assistance agreements, especially the United Nation Convention against Corruption and Implementation of the Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR) Principles on the Repatriation of Stolen Assets,\u201d Malami said.\n\nIn domesticating the issue, the AGF said \u201cthe African Union and the ECOWAS Protocols on recovery of illicit funds are equally relevant when it comes to the role of the Nigeria in relation to its other partners.\n\nAs a member of the comity of nations and a respectable international partner, the minister added that Nigeria must always strive to fulfil its international commitments in the repatriation and use of stolen funds and assets.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a way of example, the Federal Government of Nigeria has entered into numerous agreements such as the one with the United States and the Island of Jersey in 2020, and including with other countries around the world.\n\n\u201cWhere the agreements assume an international character, the specifics of the agreement often dictate the trajectory of recovery, sharing, transfer and implementation. Some element misunderstood the issue of international recoveries and locally generated funds in relation to monies belonging to the Federal Government that are locally generated. It is not to be confused with stolen funds and assets domiciled in foreign jurisdictions whose recovery and subsequent repatriation are based on international legal arrangements between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the foreign custodians of these funds.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be further noted that even recoveries of local assets are in most cases regulated by the applicable legislations and judicial pronouncements associated with these legislations and not Revenue Mobilization and Fiscal Commission Act exclusively. One can cite for the purpose of clarity recoveries done by the NDLEA, EFCC, ICPC among others.\u201d\n\nCSOs laud move\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint on the legal brawl, Executive Director Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA) Ezenwa Nwangwu said it a very important litigation which would advance the principle of federalism and expands constitutional democracy.\n\nNwangwu also expressed surprise that \u201cgovernors want democracy at the top while they behave like czars and emperors in their states.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope this also triggers and compels citizen and civic groups to institute legal actions that help to promote, financial transparency and openness in the states.\n\nAlso, former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), Mr Owei Lakemfa, said Nigeria is a federation, which in practice is run as a unitary system.\n\nHe said \u201cthe states are beginning to wake up from their slumber and the country will benefit and there might be less agitations for restructuring.\n\nLakemfa said \u201cthis is why this suit by the 36 states is salutary; the same way the Rivers State Government case against the Federal Government and the FIRS on VAT and other basic taxes is commendable.\u201d\n\nThe labour leader said he looked forward to the day state governments \u201cwill assert their right to determine who will become the Inspector General of Police and other such appointments.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Governance Manager, ActionAid Nigeria, Celestine Odo, said the governors were right in suing the federal government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey represent Nigerians and Nigerians deserve to know because they have been clamouring for the assets recovery, transparency and monitoring value amongst others. Nigerians have been rooting for accountability and transparency as regards assets recovery.\n\nOdo said the federal government was yet to tell Nigerians the total amount given to the country on COVID-19 intervention funds and Nigerians deserved to know.\n\nHe said \u201cwhat the state governments\u2019 demands are in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Right and the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) are in support.\u201d",
          "summary": "The governors also accused the federal government of diverting another N450 billion worth of non-cash assets recovered proceeds of crime since 2015.\nThey are therefore asking for the remittance of N1.8 trillion (cash) and N450billion (non-cash) in recovered loot since 2015 into the federation account.\n\u201cBy establishing the Asset Recovery Account and interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which revenue from recovered assets is to be paid, the Asset Recovery Regulation contradicts the provisions of the Constitution.\nHe said: \u201cThey represent Nigerians and Nigerians deserve to know because they have been clamouring for the assets recovery, transparency and monitoring value amongst others.\nNigerians have been rooting for accountability and transparency as regards assets recovery.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has given tips on ways to save electricity consumption among Nigerians, in light of the recent increase in electricity billing and the gnashing of the teeth by consumers.\n\nHere are Nine ways you can save electricity consumption in your residence or place of business.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 Turn off lights and electrical appliances when not in use: Don\u2019t leave your electronics or light bulbs on all day long.\n\n\u00b7 Switch to energy-efficient light bulbs: Traditional light bulbs waste 95% of the energy they use giving off heat with only 5% going toward the light. Switch them out or use them sparingly.\n\nLeaving them on for long periods is highly wasteful. Halogen incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), and light-emitting diode bulbs (LEDs) use anywhere from 25-80 per cent less electricity and last 3 to 25 times longer than traditional bulbs.\n\n\u00b7 Reduce use of water heaters: Water heating is a major contributor to your total energy consumption. Other than purchasing an energy-efficient water heater, there are two methods of reducing your water heating expenses. You can simply use less hot water or turn down the thermostat on your water heater.\n\n\u00b7 Purchase energy-efficient appliances: Appliances account for a large amount of enemy consumed in households, offices, and industries. With this in mind, it is important to be intentional about purchases made to ensure that energy-efficient appliances are installed.\n\n\u00b7 Set refrigerator temperature to the manufacturer recommendation: This is important to avoid excessive cooling and wasting energy.\n\n\u00b7 Unplug battery chargers when not in use: Many devices, including battery chargers draw power continuously even when not in use.\n\n\u00b7 Plug home electronics into power strips: Use power strips such as adaptors and extension boards to reduce energy consumption. Turn the power strips off when equipment is not in use. You\u2019ll stop these devices from using energy when idle with one convenient switch.\n\n\u00b7 Bring in sunlight: During daylight hours, switch off artificial lights and use windows and skylights to brighten your home.\n\n\u00b7 Service your air conditioner: Easy maintenance, such as routinely replacing or cleaning air filters can lower your cooling systems energy consumption.",

          "text": "Worried about the occurrence of preventable deaths in Nigeria, the National Surgical, Obstetric, Anaesthesia and Nursing Plan (NSOANP), in collaboration with Smile Train, has embarked on capacity building for nurses in the country.\n\nExperts in the health sector have revealed that a good number of deaths in the nation\u2019s health facilities were a result of a limited number of healthcare professionals including nurses, lack of modern medical equipment and the inability of nurses to carry out certain critical functions.\n\nConsequently, NSOANP the duo has organised a five day training on \u2018Nursing Care Saves Lives,\u2019 with participants drawn from the nursing profession across the country in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the training, Smile Train Programme Manager, West Africa, Victoria Awazie stressed that the training was critical to ensure that nurses were abreast with global best practices in providing care to patients.\n\nShe further disclosed that 84 nurses from the six geopolitical zones were physically in attendance, while over 200 joined the training online out of over 400 that registered.\n\n\u201cIt is a way of equipping our nurses to be abreast with the right knowledge on how to deal with their patients, considering the psychological emotions that patients have.\n\n\u201cSometimes patients don\u2019t die at surgical bed, but after the surgery as a result of complications. So, we are training the nurses to be more equipped to know what to do when such issues arise, especially when the doctors are not available\u201d, Awazie noted.\n\nOn her part, immediate past president, National Association of Nigerian Pediatric Nurses, Comrade Lawal-Aiyedun Olubunmi who raised concerns over the government\u2019s poor investment in health, stressed that adequate health budgetary allocation, timely release of funds, and training of nurses to undertake critical surgical interventions and emergency care, would help save more lives from preventable deaths.\n\nOlubunmi who doubles as a member NSOANP committee maintained that there could never be successful surgical intervention care without quality nursing care, as nurses were always available even when other health care professionals, especially doctors, were not.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is critical for nurses to have this knowledge and capacity to provide safe and quality surgical services in the country more so, nurses are the largest health care team and what is left for us to do with the number is to build their competency and confidence to be able to give quality care.\n\n\u201cI want to plead with the government; the issue of inadequate healthcare professionals where one nurse will take care of 30 to 40 patients is exhaustive, and it\u2019s not giving us desired results.\n\n\u201cOur patients are dying, and we don\u2019t want that. We want our government to be committed and invest right from the national to the state and local government to prioritize surgical anesthesia nursing intervention in this country.\u201d\n\nA critical care nurse with Defence Intelligence College, Morayo Eboh, lamented that nurses were usually forced to improvise while rendering services to patients, due to inadequate equipment that would help provide quality care to patients.\n\n\u201cIf medications or equipment are not available, there is little or more the nurses can do within their capacity. Sometimes we tend to improvise.\u201d",

About 12 victims were also rescued during the successful operation.\n\nThe suspect, Emmanuel Stephen, an indigene of Akoko, Ondo State who resides in Karimajiji, airport road, Abuja, was said to have been in a love relationship with the victim, an apprentice in one of the beauty stores in Abuja since the past two years with a promise to marry her.\n\nDuring interrogation, the suspect confessed that his Senior Sister who stays in Mali called him early in the year and told him that she had graduated from her \u201cMadam\u201d and requested for a girl to be sent to her.\n\nStephen stated further that he convinced his girlfriend who agreed and they were later linked up with somebody in Benin City, Edo State who later arranged the movement from Nigeria to Mali by road in April 2021.\n\nAccording to him, the Sister promised that the girl will help her to work in a beer parlour in Mali.\n\nInvestigation revealed that as soon as the victim arrived Mali, she was sold to another woman for a sum of N1, 500, 000 (One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Naira) and was subsequently forced into exploitative prostitution.\n\nFew weeks later, due to the rigorous sexual activities with numerous partners, the victim was said to have developed a strange sickness with other associated health challenges and presently in serious condition.\n\nThe victim was said to have called her family in Nigeria and narrated her ordeal to them.\n\nEffort by the family to bring her back yielded nothing as the Madam insisted on collecting the sum of N1.5 Million before she can release her.\n\nReacting to the development, Director General of NAPTIP, Senator Basheer Garba Muhammed, expressed sadness over the fate of the victim and promised that the Agency will work with other partners including Security Agencies to rescue her.\n\n\u201cI feel sad over the plight of the victim in question.

          "title": "Taliban Vow to Respect Women\u2019s Rights \u2018Under Islamic Law\u2019",
          "text": "The Taliban vowed Tuesday to respect women\u2019s rights, forgive those who resisted them and ensure a secure Afghanistan as part of a publicity blitz aimed at convincing world powers and a fearful population that they have changed.\n\nFollowing a lightning offensive across Afghanistan that saw many cities fall to the insurgents without a fight, the Taliban have sought to portray themselves as more moderate than when they imposed a brutal rule in the late 1990s. But many Afghans remain skeptical \u2014 and thousands raced to the airport on Monday, desperate to flee the country.\n\nOlder generations remember the Taliban\u2019s ultraconservative Islamic views, which included severe restrictions on women as well as public stonings and amputations before they were ousted by the U.S-led invasion following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.\n\nAs others have in recent days, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid addressed these concerns head on in his first news conference Tuesday.\n\nMujahid, who had been a shadowy figure for years, promised the Taliban would honor women\u2019s rights, but within the norms of Islamic law, though he gave few details. He said the group wanted private media to \u201cremain independent,\u201d but stressed journalists \u201cshould not work against national values.\u201d\n\nAnd he promised the insurgents would secure Afghanistan \u2014 but seek no revenge against those who worked with the former government or with foreign governments or forces.\n\n\u201cWe assure you that nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Enamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban\u2019s cultural commission, made similar promises, saying the Taliban would extend an \u201camnesty\u201d without giving details and encouraging women to join the government.\n\nThe capital of Kabul remained quiet for another day as the Taliban patrolled its streets and many residents stayed home, fearful after the insurgents\u2019 takeover saw prisons emptied and armories looted. Many women have expressed dread that the two-decade Western experiment to expand their rights and remake Afghanistan would not survive the resurgent Taliban.\n\nGermany, meanwhile, halted development aid to Afghanistan over the Taliban takeover. Such aid is a crucial source of funding for the country \u2014 and the Taliban\u2019s efforts to project a milder version of themselves may be aimed at ensuring that money continues to flow.\n\nWhile the Taliban pledged not to go after their enemies, there are reports that fighters have lists of people who cooperated with the government and are seeking them out. A broadcaster in Afghanistan said she was hiding at a relative\u2019s house, too frightened to return home much less return to work following reports that the insurgents are also looking for journalists. She said she and other women didn\u2019t believe the Taliban had changed their ways. She spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.\n\nSamangani addressed the concerns of women, saying a Taliban were ready to \u201cprovide women with environment to work and study, and the presence of women in different (government) structures according to Islamic law and in accordance with our cultural values.\u201d\n\nThat would be a marked departure from the last time the Taliban were in power, when women were largely confined to their homes.\n\nIn another sign of the Taliban\u2019s efforts to portray a new image, a female television anchor on the private broadcaster Tolo interviewed a Taliban official on camera Tuesday in a studio \u2014 an interaction that once would have been unthinkable. Meanwhile, women in hijabs demonstrated briefly in Kabul, holding signs demanding the Taliban not \u201celiminate women\u201d from public life.\n\nRupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for human rights, noted both the Taliban\u2019s vows and the fears of everyday Afghans.\n\n\u201cSuch promises will need to be honored, and for the time being \u2014 again understandably, given past history \u2014 these declarations have been greeted with some skepticism,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThere have been many hard-won advances in human rights over the past two decades. The rights of all Afghans must be defended.\u201d\n\nGermany, meanwhile, suspended development aid to Afghanistan, estimated at 250 million euros ($294 million) for 2021. Other funding separately goes to security services and humanitarian aid. Sweden indicated it would slow aid to the country, but Britain committed to an increase.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said humanitarian aid could rise by 10%. He said the aid budget would be reconfigured for development and humanitarian purposes and that the Taliban would not get any money previously earmarked for security.\n\nMeanwhile, Kabul\u2019s international airport, the only way out for many, reopened to military evacuation flights under the watch of American troops.\n\nAll flights were suspended on Monday when thousands of people rushed the airport. In shocking scenes captured on video, some clung to a plane as it took off and then fell to their deaths. At least seven people died in chaos at the airport, U.S. officials said.\n\nBy late Tuesday, the Taliban entered the civilian half of the airport, firing into the air to drive out around 500 people there, said an Afghan official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to brief journalists.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said U.S. commanders at the airport are communicating with Taliban leaders to keep the airlift going, adding that there have been no hostile actions by the Taliban.\n\nStill, there were indications that the situation remained tenuous. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, now operating from the airport, urged Americans to register online for evacuations but not come to the airport before being contacted.\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry said a first German military transport plane landed in Kabul, but it took off with only seven people on board due to continued chaos. Another left later with 125 people.\n\nAcross Afghanistan, the International Committee of the Red Cross said thousands had been wounded in fighting as the Taliban swept across the country in recent days, ahead of the planned withdrawal of the last American troops at the end of the month.\n\nAs U.S. President Joe Biden did, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg blamed the swift collapse of the country on a failure of Afghan leadership. But he added that the alliance must also uncover flaws in its effort to train the Afghan military.\n\nTalks continued Tuesday between the Taliban and several Afghan government officials, including former President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who once headed the country\u2019s negotiating council.\n\nDiscussions focused on how a Taliban-dominated government would operate given the changes in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, rather than just dividing up who controlled what ministries, officials with knowledge of the negotiations said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details of the talks.\n\nA top Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, arrived in Kandahar on Tuesday night from Qatar. His arrival may signal a deal is close at hand.\n\nBut in a possible complication, the vice president of the ousted government claimed on Twitter Tuesday that he was the country\u2019s \u201clegitimate\u201d caretaker president. Amrullah Saleh said, under the constitution, he should be in charge because President Ashraf Ghani has fled the country.",

This is 0.13 percentage points higher than the rate recorded in June 2021 (1.06per cent).\n\nIt said the composite food index rose by 21.03 per cent in July 2021 compared to 21.83 per cent in June 2021.\n\n\u201cThis implies that prices continued to rise in July 2021 but at a slower rise than it did in June 2021,\u201d NBS said.\n\n\u201cIn July 2021, food inflation on a year on year basis was highest in Kogi (28.51%), Enugu (24.57%) and Lagos\n\n(24.04%), while Akwa Ibom (17.85%), Bauchi (17.74%) and Abuja (16.67%) recorded the slowest rise in year on year inflation,\u201d the report added.\n\n\u201cOn month on month basis, however, July 2021 food inflation was highest in Kebbi (2.98%), Yobe (2.81) and Delta (1.98%), while Sokoto, Akwa Ibom and Imo recorded price deflation or negative inflation (general decrease in the general price level of food or a negative food inflation rate).\u201d\n\nAccording to the NBS, the rise in the food index in June was caused by increases in the prices of milk, cheese and eggs, coffee, tea and cocoa, vegetables, bread and cereals, soft drinks and meat.\n\nThe agency added that month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 0.86 per cent in July 2021, down by 0.25 per cent points from 1.11 per cent recorded in June 2021.\n\n\u201cThe average annual rate of change of the Food sub-index for the twelve months ending July 2021 over the previous twelve-month average was 20.16 per cent, 0.44 per cent points from the average annual rate of change recorded in June 2021 (19.72 per cent),\u201d it said.",

          "text": "On Monday, there was palpable excitement when news broke that President Muhammadu Buhari had signed the PetroleumIndustryBill into law. In so doing, he broke the jinx that had prevented the enactment of the oil industry legislation for 13 years.\n\nHowever, Buhari, who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum Resources, cannot afford to rest on his oars, as he would now have to contend with the difficult task of implementing the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act of 2021. Some key tasks include the establishment of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, transfer of personnel to the two new industry regulators, and appointment of executive personnel to run them.\n\nA bigger task is the corporatization of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, into a limited liability company, determination of the assets and liabilities that will be assigned to the new NNPC Limited, and how to dispose of the stranded assets and liabilities that will not be absorbed by the emerging entity.\n\nGbite Adenij discusses the key highlights of the PIA and the onerous task of implementing the new legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the oil and gas sector. Mr. Adeniji is an energy lawyer and Managing Partner at the law firm, ENR Advisory.\n\nHe also served as Technical Adviser to the former Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu.",
