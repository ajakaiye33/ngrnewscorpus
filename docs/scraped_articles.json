          "text": "The Rivers State High Court, Tuesday, granted bail to Hon. Farah Dagogo, the embattled former governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.\n\nThe bail approval came after he had spent about 60 days in detention.\n\nThe lawmaker representing Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives was arrested barely 24 hours after the state Governor, Nyesom Wike declared him wanted for alleged instigation of \u201cthugs\u201d to disrupt activities at the PDP state secretariat along Aba Road in Port Harcourt.\n\nIt was on basis of the allegation that he was whisked away at the screening hall of the South-South zonal office of the PDP during the governorship screening of the party in April.\n\nPresiding Justice, Chiwendu Nwogu, in his ruling, granted the lawmaker bail with the conditions that he must produce one surety with the sum of N20 million.\n\nNwogu also ordered Dagogo to deposit his international passport and barred him from travelling outside the country without leave of the court pending his trial at the court.\n\nJustice Nwogu also ruled that the surety must be a citizen of Nigeria and an indigene of Rivers State who must have a registered document of title that resides within Rivers State and Port Harcourt metropolis.\n\nHe ruled further that the legal assistant of the court will verify the address of the surety and both the defendant and the surety would tender two passport photographs each and three years of tax clearance.\n\nSpeaking outside the court room, Cosmos Enweluzo, SAN, lead counsel to Dagogo, said he was happy that his client has been granted bail but wondered why the court took over two months to grant the defendant bail.\n\nIn his words,\u201cWhere there is rule of law, the right and liberty of a citizen must be respected and honoured. We are talking about a citizen who is a member of the National Assembly. But in all things, we give glory to God and also express profane gratitude to the Judge for extending his discretion and magnanimity\u201d.",

          "title": "France\u2019s Macron: Russia cannot, should not win Ukraine war",
          "text": "(AP)\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that Russia \u201ccannot and should not win\u201d the war in Ukraine, as its terrible toll was on full view the day after a Russian missile strike hit a shopping mall, killing 18 people.\n\nSpeaking at the end of the Group of Seven summit in Germany, Macron said the seven industrialized democracies would support Ukraine and maintain sanctions against Russia \u201cas long as necessary, and with the necessary intensity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cRussia cannot and should not win.\u201d\n\nHis comments came as rescuers searched through the charred rubble of the shopping mall, looking for more victims of what Ukraine\u2019s president called \u201cone of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history.\u201d\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 1,000 afternoon shoppers and workers were inside the mall in the city of Kremenchuk. Giant plumes of black smoke, dust and orange flames billowed from the wreckage as emergency crews combed through broken metal and concrete for victims. Drones whirred above, clouds of dark smoke still emanating from the ruins several hours after the fire was extinguished.\n\nCasualty figures rose as rescuers sifted through the smoldering rubble. The regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said at least 18 people were killed and 59 others sought medical assistance, of whom 25 were hospitalized. The region declared a day of mourning Tuesday for the victims of the attack.\n\n\u201cWe are working to dismantle the construction so that it is possible to get machinery in there since the metal elements are very heavy and big, and disassembling them by hand is impossible,\u201d said Volodymyr Hychkan, an emergency services official.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, who is leading investigations into possible war crimes, said the missile attack was one of Russia\u2019s \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d noting that the Russian military has been \u201csystematically shelling civilian infrastructure with the aim to scare people, to kill people, to bring terror to our cities and villages.\u201d\n\nVenediktova emphasized the need for Ukrainians across the entire country to remain alert, adding that they should expect a similar strike \u201cevery minute.\u201d\n\nWayne Jordash, a British barrister who is working with Venediktova\u2019s office to investigate possible war crimes, rejected claims that a factory located near the shopping mall was a military object.\n\n\u201cThe first indications are that the factory that got hit is a road construction factory, not a military target,\u201d Jordash said. \u201cWe need to investigate whether there\u2019s military targets nearby, and the first indications as I say is that there aren\u2019t any military targets nearby.\u201d\n\nAt Ukraine\u2019s request, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting in New York on Tuesday to discuss the attack.\n\nIn the first Russian government comment on the missile strike, the country\u2019s first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, alleged multiple inconsistencies that he didn\u2019t specify, claiming on Twitter that the incident was a provocation by Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilian infrastructure, even though Russian attacks have hit other shopping malls, theaters, hospitals, kindergartens and apartment buildings in the four-month war.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian forces struck the Black Sea city of Ochakiv in the Mykolaiv region, damaging apartment buildings and killing two, including a 6-year-old child. A further six people, four of them children, were wounded. One of them, a 3-month-old baby, is in a coma, according to local officials.\n\nThe missile strike on Kremenchuk occurred as Western leaders pledged continued support for Ukraine and the world\u2019s major economies prepared new sanctions against Russia, including a price cap on oil and higher tariffs on goods.\n\nG-7 leaders condemned the attack in a statement late Monday saying \u201cindiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians constitute a war crime,\u201d noting that \u201cRussian President Putin and those responsible will be held to account.\u201d\n\nThe Russian strike echoed earlier attacks that caused large numbers of civilian casualties \u2014 such as one in March on a Mariupol theater where many civilians had holed up, killing an estimated 600, and another in April on a train station in eastern Kramatorsk that killed at least 59 people.\n\nZelenskyy said the mall presented \u201cno threat to the Russian army\u201d and had \u201cno strategic value.\u201d He accused Russia of sabotaging \u201cpeople\u2019s attempts to live a normal life, which make the occupiers so angry.\u201d\n\nIn his nightly address, he said that Russian forces had intentionally targeted the shopping center in \u201cone of the most daring terrorist attacks in European history,\u201d denouncing Russia as \u201cthe largest terrorist organization in the world.\u201d\n\nRussia has increasingly used long-range bombers in the war. Ukrainian officials said Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers flying over Russia\u2019s western Kursk region fired the missiles, one of which hit the shopping center and another that struck a sports arena in Kremenchuk.\n\nThe U.S. appeared ready to respond to Zelenskyy\u2019s call for more air defense systems, and NATO planned to increase the size of its rapid-reaction forces nearly eightfold \u2014 to 300,000 troops.\n\nThe attack on Kremenchuk coincided with Russia\u2019s all-out assault on the last Ukrainian stronghold in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk province, \u201cpouring fire\u201d on the city of Lysychansk from the ground and air, according to the local governor. At least eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded in Lysychansk when Russian rockets hit an area where a crowd gathered to obtain water from a tank, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said.\n\nThe barrage was part of Russian forces\u2019 intensified offensive aimed at wresting the eastern Donbas region from Ukraine. Over the weekend, the Russian military and their local separatist allies forced Ukrainian government troops out of Lysychansk\u2019s neighboring city, Sievierodonetsk.\n\nTo the west of Lysychansk on Monday, the mayor of the city of Sloviansk \u2014 potentially the next major battleground \u2014 said Russian forces fired cluster munitions, including one that hit a residential neighborhood. Authorities said the number of victims had yet to be confirmed. The Associated Press saw one fatality: A man\u2019s body lay hunched over a car door frame, his blood pooling onto the ground from chest and head wounds. The blast blew out most windows in the surrounding apartment blocks and the cars parked below, littering the ground with broken glass.\n\n\u201cEverything is now destroyed,\u201d said resident Valentina Vitkovska, in tears as she spoke about the blast. \u201cWe are the only people left living in this part of the building. There is no power. I can\u2019t even call to tell others what had happened to us.\u201d",

He was unaware when he got to the office this morning that he would be leaving.\n\nTHROWBACK: How SaharaReporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 October 2021 Story Detailed How Buhari Presidency Cabal Wanted Ex-Chief Justice, Tanko Muhammad Out Of Office Amid Raid On Odili\u00e2\u0080\u0099s House | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/3BIcKZugBw pic.twitter.com/n1qPzgLb0X \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 27, 2022\n\n\u201cHe was expected to declare open a workshop this morning at the NJI (National Judicial Institute). He was preparing for the conference when he read it somewhere that he has resigned.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency cabal waited to boot him out after Mary Odili retired. It is part of their plans for litigation ahead 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThere is also an allegation against one of his sons used to force him to resign. The son took $10 million from former Governor of Sokoto state, Wamakko to procure judgement for him on an election matter that didn\u2019t materialise.\n\n\u201cWammako was angry and raised an alarm over the matter. This really embarrassed Tanko and he paid back some of the money, which was a large sum. He was questioned by the cabal where he got the money to pay Wamakko from,\u201d one of the sources told SaharaReporters.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is expected to swear in Olukayode Ariwoola, who is the second most senior Justice in the Supreme Court later in the day as acting CJN.\n\nAriwoola, born on August 22, 1954, is expected to retire in 2024. He was appointed to the bench of the Apex Court as Justice on November 22, 2011.\n\nHe was appointed a Judge of the Oyo State High Court in 1992 and later made a Justice of the Court of Appeal in November 2005.\n\nA source however told SaharaReporters that the Iseyin-born jurist has a terminal illness.\n\n\u201cDo you know that Ariwoola is ill as well? He may leave soon on health grounds. That\u2019s even if they send his name to the Senate for confirmation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cWe pray he grows very old but because of his ill health, he may end up acting for a few months.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters in October 2021 exposed a plot by some Aso Rock (Presidential Villa) cabal members to remove Muhammed over his style of leadership in the judiciary.\n\nHe was appointed as acting CJN on January 25, 2019, following the suspension of Justice Walter Onnoghen.\n\nOnnoghen, who was appointed in 2016, was removed after corruption allegations were levelled against him.\n\nBut in March 2021, Onnoghen, speaking at a book launch ceremony he attended with his wife, disclosed that was removed from office over a false allegation that he held a secret meeting with former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, before the 2019 general elections.\n\nMuhammed was sworn in as a substantial CJN on July 24, 2019, with loads of expectations that include doing the bidding of the cabal members and ruling All Progressives Congress.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the grouse of members of the Aso Rock cabal against him was that he had been too slow to do their biddings.\n\n\u201cThey are planning on removing the current CJN. He is expected to retire in 2023 but they are not happy with him. They said he\u2019s too slow to do their biddings,\u201d a top source had told SaharaReporters at that time.\n\n\u201cSince Onnoghen was removed for him, clearly the cabal behind his good fortune had expectations of him which they think he is not delivering as anticipated.\u201d\n\nOn the 2021 raid of Justice Mary Odili, wife of a former Governor of Rivers State, Peter Odili, another source had said, \u201cRegarding the raid on Odili's House, it was planned because they don\u2019t want her to become the next CJN. Though she\u2019s retiring in about six months, that is like six years to the cabal. They are planning to remove Tanko Muhammad before then and don\u2019t want the woman to even act as CJN for one day.\n\n\u201cThe most senior Justice after Odili is Olukayode Ariwoola but they claim he\u2019s got a terminal illness. He is expected to retire soon on health grounds. The fourth most senior of the Justices who could take over as CJN is Musa Dattijo Muhammad, another Northerner from Niger State. He is also expected to retire in 2023.\n\n\u201cThey accused Odili of being a PDP (opposition party - Peoples Democratic Party) judge and that her husband helps to fix lots of judgements at their home in Abuja. That was why the husband was also embarrassed recently.\n\n\u201cThey want to force Tanko out soon and don\u2019t want the woman to replace him. They considered her too close to the PDP, so they have to embarrass her to ensure she doesn't get to replace him at all.\u201d",

          "text": "Justice Tanko Muhammad was forced to resign as the Chief Justice of Nigeria, multiple sources on Monday told SaharaReporters.\n\nThere have been several reports that he resigned on the grounds of ill health but the sources said it wasn\u2019t a voluntary action as he was forced to leave office.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that corruption allegation against one of his sons was one of the reasons why he had to resign.\n\nThe son was said to have accepted a $10 million bribe from former Governor of Sokoto State, Senator Aliyu Wamakko after promising to procure judgement for him on an election matter that didn\u2019t later materialise.\n\nHowever, the details of the election matter were sketchy as of the time of filing this report.\n\nBREAKING: Embattled Chief Justice Of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad Tenders Resignation Letter To Buhari | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/MPMyz8lS7E pic.twitter.com/mWluV6OVD7 \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 27, 2022\n\nIn May, Wamakko emerged as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress for Sokoto North senatorial district.\n\nThe former governor is going for a third term in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe CJN was forced to resign, He didn\u2019t voluntarily resign. He was unaware when he got to the office this morning that he would be leaving.\n\nTHROWBACK: How SaharaReporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 October 2021 Story Detailed How Buhari Presidency Cabal Wanted Ex-Chief Justice, Tanko Muhammad Out Of Office Amid Raid On Odili\u00e2\u0080\u0099s House | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/3BIcKZugBw pic.twitter.com/n1qPzgLb0X \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 27, 2022\n\n\u201cHe was expected to declare open a workshop this morning at the NJI (National Judicial Institute). He was preparing for the conference when he read it somewhere that he has resigned.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency cabal waited to boot him out after Mary Odili retired. It is part of their plans for litigation ahead 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThere is also an allegation against one of his sons used to force him to resign. The son took $10 million from former Governor of Sokoto state, Wamakko to procure judgement for him on an election matter that didn\u2019t materialise.\n\n\u201cWammako was angry and raised an alarm over the matter. This really embarrassed Tanko and he paid back some of the money, which was a large sum. He was questioned by the cabal where he got the money to pay Wamakko from,\u201d one of the sources told SaharaReporters.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is expected to swear in Olukayode Ariwoola, who is the second most senior Justice in the Supreme Court later in the day as acting CJN.\n\nAriwoola, born on August 22, 1954, is expected to retire in 2024. He was appointed to the bench of the Apex Court as Justice on November 22, 2011.\n\nHe was appointed a Judge of the Oyo State High Court in 1992 and later made a Justice of the Court of Appeal in November 2005.\n\nA source however told SaharaReporters that the Iseyin-born jurist has a terminal illness.\n\n\u201cDo you know that Ariwoola is ill as well? He may leave soon on health grounds. That\u2019s even if they send his name to the Senate for confirmation,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cWe pray he grows very old but because of his ill health, he may end up acting for a few months.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters in October 2021 exposed a plot by some Aso Rock (Presidential Villa) cabal members to remove Muhammed over his style of leadership in the judiciary.\n\nHe was appointed as acting CJN on January 25, 2019, following the suspension of Justice Walter Onnoghen.\n\nOnnoghen, who was appointed in 2016, was removed after corruption allegations were levelled against him.\n\nBut in March 2021, Onnoghen, speaking at a book launch ceremony he attended with his wife, disclosed that was removed from office over a false allegation that he held a secret meeting with former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, before the 2019 general elections.\n\nMuhammed was sworn in as a substantial CJN on July 24, 2019, with loads of expectations that include doing the bidding of the cabal members and ruling All Progressives Congress.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the grouse of members of the Aso Rock cabal against him was that he had been too slow to do their biddings.\n\n\u201cThey are planning on removing the current CJN. He is expected to retire in 2023 but they are not happy with him. They said he\u2019s too slow to do their biddings,\u201d a top source had told SaharaReporters at that time.\n\n\u201cSince Onnoghen was removed for him, clearly the cabal behind his good fortune had expectations of him which they think he is not delivering as anticipated.\u201d\n\nOn the 2021 raid of Justice Mary Odili, wife of a former Governor of Rivers State, Peter Odili, another source had said, \u201cRegarding the raid on Odili's House, it was planned because they don\u2019t want her to become the next CJN. Though she\u2019s retiring in about six months, that is like six years to the cabal. They are planning to remove Tanko Muhammad before then and don\u2019t want the woman to even act as CJN for one day.\n\n\u201cThe most senior Justice after Odili is Olukayode Ariwoola but they claim he\u2019s got a terminal illness. He is expected to retire soon on health grounds. The fourth most senior of the Justices who could take over as CJN is Musa Dattijo Muhammad, another Northerner from Niger State. He is also expected to retire in 2023.\n\n\u201cThey accused Odili of being a PDP (opposition party - Peoples Democratic Party) judge and that her husband helps to fix lots of judgements at their home in Abuja. That was why the husband was also embarrassed recently.\n\n\u201cThey want to force Tanko out soon and don\u2019t want the woman to replace him. They considered her too close to the PDP, so they have to embarrass her to ensure she doesn't get to replace him at all.\u201d",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abeg\u2019s future lies in its rebrand to a social commerce platform",
          "text": "Payment app, Abeg, has rebranded and will now be called PocketApp, a move that underlines its transition from a payment app to a social commerce app. In addition, Abeg, a subsidiary of Piggytech Global Limited, secured approval-in-principle (AIP) for a mobile money operator (MMO) license application from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the scope of its social commerce operations across the country.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Dare Adekoya, Muheez Akanni, Patricia Adoga and Eniola Ajayi-Bembe as a platform that allows users, mostly Gen Z, to send and request money through a wallet-based system, it enjoyed some virality on Twitter due to its catchy name\u2014derived from a Nigerian slag used to ask for favours. It got downloaded 5,000 times in its first 2 weeks. However, it didn\u2019t gain massive prominence until it became headline sponsor of Big Brother Nigeria (BBN), the most-watched reality TV show in Africa, in 2021. Abeg was acquired by Piggytech Global just before the show began airing, and while it entered the show with 20,000 users on its newly launched app, it claimed to have amassed almost 2 million users by the time the show ended. But after blitzscaling to millions of users in a couple of months, its success was trailed by questions about whether it could retain those users.\n\nPiggytech Global co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Joshua Chibueze told TechCabal that PocketApp is the answer to that question. \u201cSo, what we did last year was to get everyone to get the app first. It was very successful, we got over a million users. But this time around, we are going for retention, we\u2019re trying to create a brand or an app that everyone can use. But for now, we\u2019re targeting small micro-businesses and people who sell on Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nPocketApp will support seamless payments and online commerce throughout the country by adding new functionalities for users to buy and sell items via virtual Pocket shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much focused on people being able to open a pocket shop and sell online for free. Over 65% of Piggvest\u2019s current users sell something, it made sense for us because we\u2019re trying to create extra value for our current customers,\u201d Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp has expressed interest in tapping into Nigeria\u2019s social commerce market which is estimated to reach US$23.8 billion by 2028.\n\nThe MMO license will allow the PocketApp to issue e-money, create and manage wallet creation, enable USSD, recruit, manage and pay money to its agent, and manage pool accounts\u2014all of which are central to expanding social commerce.\n\nPocketApp, like MTN and Airtel, who have received similar approvals-in-principle in the past year, also voiced its support to the Nigerian government\u2019s goals for financial inclusion. \u201cPocketApp affirms its commitment to the financial inclusion agenda of the CBN and the Federal Republic of Nigeria and will continue to make it easier for our teeming young population to seamlessly carry out their transactions while saving them costs and giving them more access to get paid,\u201d it said in a statement sent to TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp COO, Patricia Adoga, said that the PocketApp infrastructure has been in the works for over 18 months to enable secure social commerce because social commerce thrives better in a more trusted environment. \u201cSo we added escrow to our payment infrastructure, protecting buyers and sellers and many other features, ensuring a smooth shopping experience on the app,\u201d Adoga said in a statement.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as a full social commerce app, it will connect buyers and sellers across Nigeria, and soon, other African countries. \u201cPeople can discover you from anywhere, as long as you do honest work and you have a smartphone,\u201c Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nChibueze explains that PocketApp hopes to break through geographical limitations and connect sellers and buyers in different parts of the country. \u201cA strawberry trader in Lagos can buy strawberries from a vendor in Jos who has a pocket shop. That way, the price will be way cheaper because you\u2019re dealing with the vendor directly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Nigeria where e-commerce is nascent and people are more comfortable with buying goods physically, e-commerce companies have to build trust with their users. He explains that trust is one of PocketApp\u2019s major offerings. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve solved for commerce is trust. Anybody can sell anything online in the safest way possible. And anybody can sign in now with confidence. Because if you pay for an item, and you\u2019ve not gotten what you want, you\u2019ve got to deliver whatever it is, and always ask for your money back.\u201d\n\nCommenting on PocketApp\u2019s approval-in-principle, co-founder and COO of Piggytech Global, Odunayo Eweniyi, said in the aforementioned statement, \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly pleased that PocketApp has been granted an approval-in-principle as a Mobile Money Operator in Nigeria. We will now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the full operating license, enabling us to continue growing and expanding the scope of our social payments, social commerce and other digital financial products to reach millions of Nigerian micro-entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "June 19, 2022\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, I\u2019ve attended 2 major conferences: VivaTech in Paris and the European Development Days (EDD) in Brussels. During my time at these conferences, I realised that funding and support for African startups and the tech ecosystem don\u2019t just come from investment firms, angel investors, corporates, and tech hubs. There are other players.\n\nIt\u2019s popular to define progress in the African tech ecosystem by the amount of venture funding raised, but the conversations I had made me wonder whether it was also worth measuring this progress in relation to the activities of development agencies and governmental organisations.\n\nPartner Message\n\nYou are invited to an upcoming virtual pitch & conference organized by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Nigeria Office in partnership with Nikkei Inc. Kindly register your interests here.\n\nDevelopment agencies\u2014international and local non-governmental organisations\u2014are tasked with fostering the socio-economic development of different countries, but now more than ever they are realising that leveraging technology is a no-brainer.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC), the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the development of the private sector, might be more popular for financing roads, ports and other infrastructure across Africa but over the past 60 years has been it has invested about $10 billion in the private sector, working with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to create jobs and improve livelihoods. In 2020, it led the World Bank Group #GlobalTechChallenge initiative to match early-stage health tech innovators with healthcare providers in East Africa. Some of these health tech companies were also provided with funding.\n\nSource: Fikayo Idowu, TechCabal Insights.\n\nTo reduce the financing gap women entrepreneurs still face, in January the IFC launched the ScaleX program that incentivises accelerators to help women-led companies in emerging markets raise equity financing by awarding deserving accelerators up to $25,000. Three years after leading a $8.6 million Series A Investment in Africa\u2019s Talking, the IFC recently backed ride-hailing startup Gozem with $10 million to finance 6,000 vehicles in Togo and Benin.\n\nClosely related to this is the work the International Trade Centre does toward making global prosperity a reality by connecting small businesses in developing countries to international markets. This entails that it has projects in Benin, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Mali, Uganda, Zambia, and other African countries that focus on the creation of sustainable jobs in the digital technologies sector, and the modernisation of agribusiness through digital technologies.\n\nAdvisory services can play an important role in shaping the allocation of vast amounts of resources. In this vein, the AU-EU D4D Hub primarily aids African governments with strategy formulation and frameworks for digital transformation.\n\nIn the 2 years since it launched, the AU-EU D4D Hub has conducted feasibility studies in Uganda and Rwanda, as well as learning sessions with the Tanzanian government. Germany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) make-IT project develops and implements accelerator and funding programmes across 18 countries on the continent, according to a 2017-2019 impact report\n\nSource: Fikayo Idowu, TechCabal Insights.\n\nWith an estimated number of over 300 million French speakers across 5 continents, the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF), which was created in 1970, is increasing its efforts to give francophone African startups more visibility and attract funding.\n\nSenegal\u2019s D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) since 2018 has been investing in the country\u2019s tech environment, granting about 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out and helping transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem.\n\nMany other African country governments like Mauritius, Congo, Tunisia, Ghana, and Rwanda have initiatives to spur the tech ecosystem in their country.\n\nIt can be challenging to quantify the impact of some of these projects and programmes\u2014training sessions or sponsorship of startups to conferences, for example\u2014but they sure lead to business leads and investment opportunities.\n\nThe attention that African startups are receiving from developmental and international agencies is a testament to the capability of these startups to spread innovation and produce tailor-made solutions for some of Africa\u2019s biggest problems.\n\nPartner Message\n\nApplications are now open for the Decentralized Umoja Algorand Bounty Hack III, by Algorand and Reach. The Africa-focused hackathon is an excellent opportunity for developers to learn & build blockchain projects\u2014prizes of up to $6,000 to be won, including a $1,000 participation prize. Applications are open here until 15th July 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nBetter awareness of the different players and activities in the African tech ecosystem creates room for collaboration. For instance, during the European Development Days, I witnessed an intro conversation between representatives of the ITC and African European Digital Innovation Bridge (AEDIB) Initiative concerning their projects. The ITC is working on mapping the tech hubs in Africa, while the AEDIB is building digital innovation hubs\u2014a virtual cluster of innovation centres such as tech hubs, research institutes, universities and others in a community. Since they were working on solving a similar problem, at different levels, it created a perfect opportunity for a partnership.\n\nOne way to scale the impact of the investment activities of development agencies in the Africa tech ecosystem is to increase similar partnerships between them and other players such as tech hubs, universities, and research institutes.\n\nFrom the Cabal\n\nHave a great week.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Next Wave. Please share today\u2019s edition with your network on WhatsApp, Telegram and other platforms, and reply to this email to let us know what we can be better at.\n\nSubscribe to our TC Daily Newsletter to receive all the technology and business stories you need each weekday at 7 AM (WAT).\n\nFollow TechCabal on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn to stay engaged in our real-time conversations on tech and innovation in Africa.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi, Senior Writer, TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Comrade Philip Shaibu, has condemned the killing of a Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia, in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area of the State.\n\nShaibu, who led other government functionaries and heads of security agencies in the state, on Monday, to Ikabigbo, called for calm among residents in the community.\n\nThe acting governor also commiserated with the Head of Ikabigbo Community, Aleghe Braimah; family of a member of the Edo Vigilante Network who lost his life in an attempt to rescue the priest, Yusuf Nurudeen, and the Ogieneni of Uzairue, Kadiri Omogbai.\n\nShaibu said he was in the area to commiserate with the Uzairue people and get first-hand knowledge of the incident, noting, \u201cThe unfortunate attack resulted in the killing of Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia at St. Michael Catholic Church, Ikabigbo in Etsako West Local Government Area. I received briefs from eyewitnesses in the community and assured the troubled community that the assailants will be brought to book and made to pay for their crimes.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are pained by the loss of both the reverend father and the member of the vigilante group, who was killed but I am particularly happy with our youth and the vigilante group and the hunters. We also commend the police and the military for their prompt action. We\u2019re very saddened that we lost our loved ones.\n\n\u201cI insisted that we must come to see what has happened for ourselves. We have gotten some information already. Last night, I insisted that the military should remain in the bush to comb the forest. As we speak, they\u2019re still there because we want to make sure that none of the culprits escapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will also look at what has happened here critically because Edo State has been relatively peaceful. We will not allow these miscreants to come into our state and disrupt the peace that we\u2019re already enjoying. Edo will be too hot for them. We will assess what has happened to know how to correct them,\u201d Shaibu noted.\n\nThe Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, assured the community members and relatives of the casualties that the security outfits will not rest until the criminals are brought to book.\n\nHe implored the community to partner with the Police and charged anyone taking actions to work within the ambits of the law to ensure that they do not run afoul of the law.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday ended abruptly the ongoing Continuous Voters Card (CVR) registration in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja over crowd disturbance.\n\nThe commission\u2019s Resident Electoral Commissioner in the FCT, Yahaya Bello, while speaking on the development, lamented that people who had no business with the CVR process stormed the office to cause a commotion, forcing the commission to stop the process for the time being.\n\n\u201cPeople came that they wanted their PVCs, but you cannot get your PVC in a rowdy situation, a hundred people cannot go and stand in a room that cannot contain 10 people.\n\n\u201cYou have to stay on the line that is how it is done. Somebody who has never come to INEC before will just walk into the office that he wants to collect his PVC.\n\n\u201cWhat is that? he has to go through CVR, we have to know why he is here, whether he wants to transfer, or he has lost his PVC whether he has never voted before, and so on.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just come and start shouting that you want PVC, it is not done like that.\n\n\u201cWe attend to more than 750 people in a day and up to 200 people are banging on our door that they want PVC, but they are not ready for PVC. I don\u2019t know what they are looking for.\n\n\u201cCertainly, these people are not here for PVC, they are here to cause commotion unnecessarily in order to steal from people,\u2019\u2019 Bello said.\n\nHowever, many Abuja residents alleged that INEC was making it difficult for them to be registered for the Continuous Voters Card.\n\nThey argued that they left their homes as early as 4am to be registered only for \u201cINEC to announce they were not working today\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe residents were seen hitting the INEC office gate shouting \u201cwe want our PVCs\u2019\u2019, while some of them lay on the road threatening not to leave the road until they get their PVCs, thereby, obstructing the movement of cars.\n\nMany of the residents said they had registered and wanted to collect their PVCs, while many others want to do fresh registration.\n\nOne of the youths, Emmanuel Ogbon, said that he got to the INEC office at about 5am and was given a book to write his name.\n\n\u201cWe wrote our names and they asked us to join the queue which we did, they later said that their machines were not on ground, that they would have to go and get them.\n\n\u201cWe have been here and they have not been addressing us, what we need is our PVCs because we want to vote this time.\n\n\u201cThey said that youths are lazy, but this time we don\u2019t want to be lazy, we want to vote. Until they give us our PVCs, we are not going to leave here,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nAnother resident, Mr. Emmanuel Ibrahim alleged that INEC was intentionally making it difficult for them to be registered to get their PVCs.\n\n\u201cThey are intentionally frustrating us, they have the machines, we saw them, the crowd was there, and the machines were there.\n\n\u201cNow see the crowd since morning, yet nobody is attending to them.\n\n\u201cEven if they say that they are not extending the deadline, today is not June 30, we still have many days to go, at least allow that 30th to come then you can tell us otherwise.\n\n\u201cSee the crowd yet no single person has been attended to and then you want credible elections.\n\nA businesswoman, Ms. Juliet Uche said that they closed their shops to come and register and get their PVCs, adding that they would no longer sell their votes for items and other things, they must vote and secure their future.\n\n\u201cIf I had opened my shop today, I will get one naira or two naira, to be honest with you, it is not easy. Imagine one cup of groundnut being sold for N200.\n\n\u201cThe prices of foodstuff and other items have increased and the salary is too poor, how much are workers being paid, so it is important for youths to vote.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother resident, Mr Chukwu Godswill said that he came to make corrections on his PVC but he was not allowed access into INEC office.\n\n\u201cWe have had very bad experiences here, since Saturday, people have been coming for this and nothing has been done.\n\n\u201cWe got here this morning and they said that their machines are not working, my question is must we suffer like this.\n\n\u201cWe are budgeting a lot of money for the commission to get this done, must we go through all these before we can vote? This is our right,\u2019\u2019 Godswill said.\n\nAnother resident, Mr Olawale Rufia, said that the PVC process was taking too much time and the INEC staff had been telling them to go and come every day.\n\n\u201cIt has been come back today, come back tomorrow, at the end of this month, the CVR process will come to an end.\n\n\u201cWe all know what today\u2019s date is, so in another two days, it means we cannot collect the PVC again and they are telling us to come back on Wednesday. How long is this process going to take? That\u2019s one.\n\n\u201cSecondly, if we are not given this PVC today or by Wednesday as promised, it won\u2019t be good, now the most painful thing is that they are inside and not responding to anyone.\u2019\u2019",

He began his primary education less than a year later in 1959 at the Local Authority Demonstration School, Oluwole, in his hometown. He would spend eight years in school before graduating in 1967.\n\nHe then moved to Muslim Modern School in the same town from 1968 to 1969 before graduating to Ansar-Ud-Deen high school, Saki area of Oyo, for secondary education.\n\nHe earned his law degree from the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1980, and a year later he was called to the Nigerian bar and got enrolled as a solicitor and advocate of the supreme court.\n\nMany have thus, wondered how possible it is for the new CJN to have started school just a year after he was born.\n\nMeanwhile, before Ariwoola was sworn into his new role, insiders within the apex revealed to TheCable that some northern justices were against his appointment on the grounds that the 63-year-old is allegedly battling health issues.\n\nThey, according to the medium, alleged that the illness might affect Ariwoola\u2019s performance as the leader of the supreme court just as it did the immediate past CJN.",

          "text": "A Federal High Court sitting federal in Abuja has dismissed a fresh application for bail by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe application was filed pending the determination of the treasonable felony charge against him by the Federal Government.\n\nKanu, who is currently facing a seven-count charge, had in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), also challenged the revocation of the bail the court earlier granted to him.\n\nHe asked the court to set aside the order it made on March 28, 2019, which not only issued a bench warrant for his arrest, but also gave FG the nod to try him in absentia.\n\nThe IPOB leader told the court that contrary to FG\u2019s allegation that he jumped bail, he fled for his life after his home town at Afaraukwu Ibeku in Umuahia, Abia State, was invaded by soldiers, which he said led to the death of 28 persons.\n\nWhile contending that he was denied a fair hearing before his bail was revoked, Kanu attached eight exhibits that included photographs, as well as an affidavit he deposed from Isreal, after he fled from the country.\n\nDismissing the bail request on Tuesday, Justice Binta Nyako said she was not satisfied with the reason the IPOB leader gave for his failure to appear in court for the continuation of his trial.\n\nThe trial judge noted that from records of the court, Kanu was represented by his lawyer on the day his bail was revoked, likewise his sureties.\n\n\u201cIn fact, he sureties told the court that they did not know the whereabouts of the Defendant and even applied to be discharged from the matter.\n\nJustices Nyako also held that though a court could vacate a previous order when confronted with a cogent and verifiable reason, \u201cin the instant case, I have not been given any, neither have I been given any reason to set aside the order.\n\n\u201cThe present application amounts to an abuse of court process for attempting to relitigate an issue already decided by the court.\n\n\u201cIf the Defendant is dissatisfied, he has the Appeal Court to go to. This application is accordingly dismissed\u201d, Justice Nyako said.\n\nThe Judge had also on March 18, declined to release the embattled IPOB leader on bail.\n\nThe court maintained that Kanu must explain the reason why he breached the previous bail that was given to him, before he could enjoy another favourable discretion from it.\n\n\u201cUntil the issue of the absence of the defendant for his trial, with all the bail conditions breached, is determined, the instant application of the defendant for bail will at best be premature and it is refused.\n\n\u201cHowever, the defendant is at liberty to re-file the application\u201d, Justice Nyako said.\n\nMeanwhile, the case has been adjourned till November 14 for mention, to await the outcome of Kanu\u2019s appeal.",

She retired on May 12.\n\nIt was learnt that Muhammad, who was appointed in 2019, had been battling with memory disorder, making him unable to fully discharge his responsibilities.\n\nIt was also learnt that the ex-CJN could no longer cope with the rigours of the bench, especially legal research.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t want some forces to take advantage of his challenge to hijack or influence Supreme Court decisions, which they reckoned could cause crisis in the country.\n\nThe protest by his colleague-justices against his management of the apex court exposed his deteriorating condition.\n\nFourteen justices on the apex court bench wrote to the ex-CJN on the poor condition of service they were faced with.\n\nSources said Justice Muhammad got a medical advisory to \u201cslow down drastically\u201d.\n\nA top source, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cRight from the time he took over from former CJN Walter Onnoghen, CJN Tanko Mohammed had been managing his health challenges.\n\n\u201cThe weight of office as the CJN made him to slip into suspected dementia. Each time he had meeting with his colleagues, he would forget resolutions and might not follow up with any action.\n\n\u201cApart from the rigours of legal research, the health situation of the CJN could not allow him to attend to some administrative duties, including non-signing of amended Rules of Court for almost three years.\n\n\u201cHe has no disdain for his colleagues, but his health challenge accounted for the lapses which led to a letter of protest by Supreme Court Justices.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the fact that on March 23, the CJN constituted a Welfare Committee, all was not well in the Supreme Court till yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe committee on March 24 submitted a list of demands by the Supreme Court Justices to the CJN, which could not be met.\n\n\u201cThe issues raised by the justices are non-replacement of poor vehicles; accommodation problem; lack of drugs at the Supreme Court clinic; epileptic electricity supply to the Supreme Court; increase in electricity tariff; no increase in the of diesel; lack of internet services to residences and chambers.\n\n\u201cOthers are internal problems including non-signing of amended Rules of Court for almost three years; sudden stoppage of two to three foreign workshops and trainings per annum for justices; no provision of qualified legal assistants\n\n\u201cIn the midst of the protest by Justices of the Supreme Court, there was a medical advisory that he should slow down drastically.\n\n\u201cThe situation was becoming complex and to avoid some forces taking advantage of the ill- health of the CJN to tamper with crucial judgments, he had to quit.\u201d\n\nJustice Tanko Muhammad had resigned on Monday, necessitating the swearing in of the second most senior justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola as acting CJN by PresidentMuhammadu Buhari.",

Besides that, the Apex Court has to a larger extent, been living to its constitutional responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe accusation so far, in summary, is that more or all ought to have been done and not that nothing has been done; which is utopian in the contemporary condition of our country.\u201d\n\nMuhammad had stepped into office after Walter Onnoghen, his predecessor, was removed on a controversial note in 2019.\n\nOnnoghen was suspended in 2019 after a civil rights group filed a petition against him at the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB).\n\nAmong the allegations leveled against him was owning some secret foreign accounts, which were run in a manner inconsistent with financial transparency and the code of conduct for public officials.\n\nAlthough he denied the allegations, Onnoghen was convicted by the Code of Conduct Tribunal on April 18, 2019, for false assets declaration, and banned from holding public office for 10 years.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Tuesday, dismissed a fresh application the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, filed to be released on bail, pending the determination of the treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him.\n\nAccording to a report by Vanguard, trial Justice Binta Nyako who dismissed the request said she was not satisfied with the reason the IPOB leader gave for his failure to appear in court for the continuation of his trial.\n\nThe trial judge noted that from records of the court, Kanu was represented by his lawyer on the day his bail was revoked, likewise his sureties.\n\n\u201cIn fact, he sureties told the court that they did not know the whereabouts of the Defendant and even applied to be discharged from the matter.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Defendant was not denied fair hearing\u201d.\n\nBesides, Justices Nyako held that though a court could vacate a previous order when confronted with a cogent and verifiable reason, \u201cin the instant case, I have not been given any, neither have I been given any reason to set aside the order.\n\n\u201cThe present application amounts to an abuse of court process for attempting to relitigate an issue already decided by the court.\n\n\u201cIf the Defendant is dissatisfied, he has the Appeal Court to go to.\n\n\u201cThis application is accordingly dismissed\u201d, Justice Nyako held.\n\nThe court maintained that Kanu must explain the reason why he breached the previous bail that was given to him before he could enjoy another favourable discretion from it.\n\n\u201cUntil the issue of the absence of the defendant for his trial, with all the bail conditions breached, is determined, the instant application of the defendant for bail will at best be premature and it is refused.\n\n\u201cHowever, the defendant is at liberty to re-file the application\u201d, Justice Nyako added.\n\nKanu, who is currently facing a seven-count charge, had in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, equally challenged the revocation of the bail the court earlier granted to him.\n\nHe specifically urged the court to set aside the order it made on March 28, 2019, which not only issued a bench warrant for his arrest but also gave FG the nod to try him in absentia.",

          "text": "The trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu will resume on Tuesday, June 28, at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, warned that security agents must stop harassing those who would come to show solidarity with the IPOB leader at the court.\n\nEjiofor argued that there had been several high-profile trials involving prominent Nigerians, with supporters thronging the court premises in solidarity, who were not intimidated by the security agencies.\n\nThis is even as he advised the supporters to be civil in their approach while at the court premises.\n\nHis statement reads, \u201cWe conducted our routine court-Ordered visit to our indefatigable Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu at the DSS Headquarters.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s visit was unique because it was basically to harmonise the final legal strategy for tomorrow\u2019s outing. Onyendu is fully prepared for his Court appearance tomorrow, and he is in good spirit. We are confident that justice will be done tomorrow too.\n\n\u201cOnyendu thanked millions of his supporters and UmuChineke for standing shoulder to shoulder with him thus far. However, Onyendu is particularly worried over the continued incarceration of Mrs. Ukamaka Ejezie (Mama Biafra), whose only offence was daring to be in Abuja in solidarity with him.\n\n\u201cThe legal team is aggressively exploring all permissible legal frameworks to ensure Mama Biafra\u2019s release. As you may be aware, the Court has fixed the 20th day of July 2022, for definite hearing of the application we filed for her release.\n\n\u201cMay we respectfully, use this medium to appeal to Onyendu\u2019s followers, supporters and well-wishers, who intend coming to Court tomorrow in solidarity with Onyendu, to please maintain absolute civility in their conduct, as have always demonstrated.\n\n\u201cIt is possible you all may not be accommodated within the precinct of the Court, but you could organise yourselves outside the Court premises and remain peaceful, as always.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the Law Enforcement Agencies are reminded once again, that the Court environment is not a police barrack nor an environment reserved for only security operatives. The Court is a public place meant for everyone.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are appealing to the respective law enforcement agencies that will provide security in and around the Court premises tomorrow not to harass, intimidate, and/or arrest innocent civilians for coming to court in solidarity with Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cMay we remind you that we have witnessed several high profile trials involving prominent Nigerians from other divides, where their loved ones thronged the Court premises in solidarity, but nobody was either intimidated, arrested or molested.\n\n\u201cA case in hand is the trial of the suspended DCP Abba Kyari, which has continued to witness outrageous number of sympathisers who have never been molested, arrested or intimidated. Therefore, we expect utmost decorum in and around the Court tomorrow.\n\n\u201cDear UmuChineke, please be reminded that your prayers and supplications are impacting positively, and they are needed now, as always. Do not relent until the final victory.\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic for a very fruitful outing tomorrow. With God on our side, Victory is assured. The hour has come!\n\n\u201cMay you all remain richly blessed. Forward ever, in victory and backward never.\u201d",

Whether or not he was misquoted or meant what was credited to him.\n\n\u201cAlthough he has not debunked what was reported, one can assume that what was quoted to have been said by him is correct, but if he fails to openly come out and say which is correct in 48 hours, you will hear the bombardment and I will have no option but to break the egg and tell the whole world and Nigerians who is Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt Obasanjo may still be angry with Atiku even after helping him to succeed but perhaps for truncating his third term agenda, in any case, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku is our presidential candidate and I can tell you for sure that he will be the President in 2023 In shaa Allah.\n\n\u201cA high-powered reconciliatory committee would be constituted to meet Governor Nyesom Wike and appeal to him.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike is a great party man who fought for the party, when the committee is constituted, in which we will also bring other contestants together, we will go and meet with Governor Wike and appeal to him even if it means kneeling down to beg him.\n\n\u201cIt is our belief that in any contest, there will always be a winner and a loser and we must take whatever comes our way as the will of God who gives power to whatever he wishes at the time he wishes.\n\n\u201cAtiku is a great man, a man of honor and integrity who will lead Nigeria to greatness, we will bring our head down infact very low, and respect every Nigeria as a party and that is why we are calling on party members to be united to. enaure that we win the next election. We must unite among ourselves and avoid speaking against ourselves in a manner that portrays the party in a bad light.\n\n\u201cWe lost Ekiti election because there was no unity among party members but we have learnt our lessons, that is why prominent persons have been appointed to handle the Osun election and I can tell you that Senator Ademola Adeleke will be the next governor of Osun State.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is kicking very well and we will rule Nigeria again and do better. We will do all within our powers to ensure victory for Atiku and Okowa come 2023 Presidential elections.\u201d",

In any case, Alhaji Abubakar Atuku is our presidential candidate and I can tell you for sure that he will be the President in 2023 insha Allah.\u201d\n\nOn the the outcome of the Presidential primaries and subsequent picking of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate of Atiku which may have angered Governor Nyesom Wike, the BoT Chairman disclosed that a high powered reconciliatory committee is soon to be constituted to meet Governor Wike and appeal to him.\n\n\u201dGovernor Wike is a great party man who fought for the party, when the committee is constituted, in which we will also bring other contestants together, we will go and meet with Governor Wike and appeal to him even if it means kneeling down to beg him,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Serena Williams returns to singles tennis at Wimbledon after a year away on Tuesday as Rafael Nadal begins his quest to win the third leg of a potential calendar Grand Slam.\n\nWomen\u2019s top seed Iga Swiatek, who has won her past six tournaments, will kick off proceedings on Centre Court at 1330 local time (1230 GMT) against Croatian qualifier Jana Fett.\n\nBut the main focus will be on seven-time champion Williams, who faces unseeded Harmony Tan of France in her first singles match since an injury forced her to pull out of her first-round match last year.\n\nWilliams, 40, won the last of her Wimbledon singles titles six years ago but reached the final in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe American, who was given a wildcard for this year\u2019s tournament, is stuck on 23 Grand Slam singles wins \u2014 agonisingly one short of Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record.\n\nDoubts had been growing about whether Williams \u2014 who has slumped to 1,204th in the world after her period of inaction, would return to the sport.\n\nBut she warmed up by teaming up with Ons Jabeur in the doubles at Eastbourne last week and Wimbledon is widely considered her best chance of winning an elusive 24th Grand Slam.\n\n\u2013 Nadal eyes calendar slam-\n\nNadal is halfway to winning all four majors this year after following up his Australian Open triumph by winning his 14th French Open title.\n\nNo man has achieved the feat since Ron Laver in 1969, with Novak Djokovic falling just short last year when he lost in the final of the US Open.\n\nThe Spaniard\u2019s win at Roland Garros earlier this month took him to 22 Grand Slam singles titles \u2014 two clear of Djokovic and Roger Federer.\n\nNadal won the most recent of his two Wimbledon titles in 2010, having captured his first with an epic triumph over Federer two years earlier.\n\nThere was a question mark over his durability for the two weeks at Wimbledon having played the entire French Open with his troublesome left foot anaesthetised.\n\nThe 36-year-old second seed has since undergone a course of radiofrequency stimulation, a treatment aimed at reducing nerve pain in his foot.\n\n\u201cI can walk normal most of the days, almost every single day,\u201d said Nadal, who faces Argentina\u2019s Francisco Cerundolo in his opening match.\n\n\u201cWhen I wake up, I don\u2019t have this pain that I was having for the last year and a half.\u201d\n\nSwiatek\u2019s last match was a comprehensive victory against Coco Gauff in the French Open final \u2014 her 35th consecutive win.\n\nWimbledon will test the Polish top seed\u2019s ability to keep the run going. Reaching the fourth round last year was her best performance, even though she was junior champion in 2018.\n\n\u201cGrass is always tricky,\u201d said the 21-year-old. \u201cI actually like the part that I have no expectations there. It\u2019s something kind of refreshing.\u201d\n\nOther players in action in the women\u2019s draw on Tuesday include 2019 champion Simona Halep, who is the 16th seed this year, and last year\u2019s beaten finalist, Karolina Pliskova.\n\nOn the men\u2019s side, fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas takes on Switzerland\u2019s Alexander Ritschard while 2021 runner-up Matteo Berrettini, the eighth seed, plays Chile\u2019s Cristian Garin.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Tuesday, dismissed a fresh application by the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra to be released on bail, pending the determination of the treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him.\n\nNnamdi Kanu, who is currently facing a seven-count charge, had in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, equally challenge the revocation of the bail the court earlier granted to him.\n\nHe specifically urged the court to set aside the order it made on March 28, 2019, which not only issued a bench warrant for his arrest, but also gave FG the nod to try him in absentia.\n\nThe IPOB leader told the court that contrary to FG\u2019s allegation that he jumped bail, he said that he fled for his life after his home town at Afaraukwu Ibeku in Umuahia, Abia State, was invaded by soldiers, which he said led to the death of 28 persons.\n\nContending that he was denied fair hearing before his bail was revoked, Kanu, attached eight exhibits that included photographs, as well as an affidavit he deposed to from Isreal after he fled from the country.\n\nMeanwhile, dismissing the bail request on Tuesday, trial Justice Binta Nyako, said she was not satisfied with the reason the IPOB leader gave for his failure to appear in court for continuation of his trial.\n\nThe trial judge noted that from records of the court, Kanu, was represented by his lawyer on the day his bail was revoked, likewise his sureties.\n\n\u201cIn fact, his sureties told the court that they did not know the whereabout of the Defendant and even applied to be discharged from the matter.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Defendant was not denied fair hearing\u201d.\n\nBesides, Justices Nyako held that though a court could vacate a previous order when confronted with a cogent and verifiable reason, \u201cin the instant case, I have not been given any, neither have I been given any reason to set-aside the order.\n\n\u201cThe present application amounts to an abuse of court process for attempting to relitigate an issue already decided by the court.\n\n\u201cIf the Defendant is dissatisfaction, he has the Appeal Court to go to.\n\n\u201cThis application is accordingly dismissed\u201d, Justice Nyako held.\n\nIt will be recalled that the court had also on March 18, declined to release the embattled IPOB leader on bail.\n\nThe court maintained that Kanu must explain the reason why he breached the previous bail that was given to him, before he could enjoy another favourable discretion from it.\n\n\u201cUntil the issue of the absence of the defendant for his trial, with all the bail conditions breached, is determined, the instant application of the defendant for bail will at best be premature and it is refused.\n\n\u201cHowever, the defendant is at liberty to re-file the application\u201d, Justice Nyako added.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has assessed the current war being waged against illicit drugs in the country and declared that the days of drug abuse were numbered in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking on Monday in Abuja, on the occasion of the 2022 United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking which had as its theme: \u201cAddressing Drug Challenges in Health and Humanitarian Crises,\u201d Osinbajo flayed the prevailing menace of drug abuse in Nigeria, which he said portends grave consequences for young people and undermines the security of the country.\n\nHe, however said the nation was winning the drug war, adding that the days of the scourge of drug abuse and dependency in the country were numbered.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s optimism was premised on the renewed vigour of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the commitment of the Federal Government and the support of development partners.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe are winning this war. The days of the scourge of drug abuse and dependency are clearly numbered, but it will involve even greater investment in focus and determination for the long haul,\u201d according to the Vice President.\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA especially in the last two years under the dynamic leadership of General Buba Marwa, the NDLEA Chairman, has been fiercer and sharper in its determination to stamp out drug abuse and trafficking in the country. His vision and strong resolve have given the war against drug trafficking and abuse new energy, purpose and clearer direction.\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear that in 2021, about 8,000 drug users were counselled and rehabilitated by the NDLEA, and in the first half of this year alone, over 11,000 drug users have been counselled and treated. We must maintain a multi-dimensional and holistic approach to tackling drug abuse.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the approach that ensures the realisation of the objective, Osinbajo said, \u201cthe new normal offers us opportunities for increased innovation in tackling this menace, through technology-based monitoring systems for promptly detecting and addressing drug market changes; and also accelerating mobile outreach programmes, remote consultation, and treatment for those who suffer from drug use disorders and are without the appropriate care.\u201d\n\nHe noted that in as much as the federal government through its agencies and the state governments would lead the charge with decisive policy initiatives, the strides must be complemented by changes at the family and community level.\n\n\u201cThe kind of change we seek regarding drug abuse cannot happen without the collaboration of families, faith-based organisations and community leadership at the local levels.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, therefore, noted that a society free of drug criminals was achievable by, \u201crelentlessly breaking illicit drug supply chains and distribution networks; discouraging drug use through intensive outreach and sensitisation; and also promptly prosecuting traffickers.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cWe must intensify rehabilitation of drug addicts, because what we are faced with is indeed a public health crisis \u2014 a crisis that is taking lives, destroying families and shattering communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the vice president, drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking has become a global public health and socio economic challenge, which places a huge burden on the Nigeria\u2019s health care system, with, \u201cgrave consequences for young people and the productivity of our labor force,\u201d undermining the security of communities.\n\nOsinbajo made specific reference to a United Nations Office for Drug and Crime (UNODC) report which said, \u201cdrug use was responsible for the death of almost half a million people in 2019. And drug use disorders resulted in the loss of 18 million years of healthy life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 2018 National Drug use survey also revealed that Nigeria at the time that there were about 14.3 million drug users, of which close to 3 million suffer from drug use disorder.\n\n\u201cThis figure represents a 14.4 per cent prevalence rates in Nigeria, which is about three times the global average prevalence rate of five per cent. The UNODC also in its 2021 World Drug Report projects that by 2030 the number of people using drugs around the world will rise by 11 per cent and by 40 per cent in Africa alone causes a disturbing projection because as the country with the largest population in Africa, this implies that Nigeria\u2019s use of drug abuse prevalence will rise substantially especially considering the proportions that we are leaders in terms of population.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the past 17 months, the elderly we are told has recorded over 17,647 arrests of offenders including 10 drug barons and I\u2019m sure that that number increases everyday if you\u2019re following the news, with over 2369, convicted persons and over 150,000 kilograms of drugs that have been seized within the same period. So the statistics show that 5.5 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 64 years used drugs at least once since 2018. This is precisely the age bracket that we cannot afford to lose to drugs.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, while lamenting the increasing trends of drug abuse in areas of conflict and in post conflict settings, such as in IDP and refugee camps, said the development was a special concern to Nigeria, especially as the country is in the throes of civil conflict and terrorism, resulting in the displacement of large numbers of our population.\n\nHe said young people who are usually the most vulnerable to drug, also form the majority of armed combatants and the resultant widespread use of drugs by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cIndeed, some studies have shown that after controlling for armed groups and individual level variables, drug intake and alcohol consumption, sharply increase the violent actions perpetrated during conflicts.\n\n\u201cFor women and girls in particular, the situation is more harrowing. They\u2019re exposed to severe traumatic situations. Due to violence, and sometimes sexual exploitation, especially in camps, which together with other stressful factors of displacement can lead to drug use. These problems are all worsened by the expected lack of access to treatment and therapies for drug abuse in refugee or IDP camps.\u201d\n\nAgainst this background, the vice president said the federal government had also taken both specific and general actions over the past seven years, all directed at trying to control or deal with the menace of illicit drug trafficking in Nigeria in particular.\n\nThese actions, Osinbajo said, include adopting a synergized and multi-agency approach, adding, \u201cthe government has deployed counterterrorism and Counter Narcotics initiatives led by the NDLEA which have successfully disrupted several high profile drug networks. And as part of these efforts with the funding from the European Union, and technical support from the UNODC relevant MDAS and civil society organisations, were rolled out by the National Drug Control master plan for 2021 to 2025.\n\n\u201cThis plan itself leverages an extensive evidence base, including the very first National Drug Use Survey which was conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe master plan adopts a comprehensive and inclusive approach to addressing issues of drug supply reduction, issues of drug abuse and it has it is based on four thematic pillars, drug supply reduction, demand reduction, access to drug on medical purposes, and governance and coordination.\n\n\u201cThe plan is not just an approach majorly targeted at drug supply reduction, is a much more balanced plan and it is much more health centered and looks at drug control not just from the point of view of abuse but also from a health perspective.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the NDLEA has commenced measures aimed at improving access to treatment, care and rehabilitation in order to stave off the public health problems that are drug abuse-related as part of radical reforms in the fight against abuse in the country,\n\nChairman/Chief Executive Officer, Brig Gen Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd), earlier in his welcome address, revealed the arrest of 10 major drug barons which he said have already been \u201ctaken out of circulation\u201d with many more on the NDLEA\u2019s watchlist along with their foot soldiers.\n\nMarwa said the agency had been involved in a series of training, including on Drug Prevention, Treatment and Care (DPTC) for the officers, \u201cto refocus from the criminalisation of drug users to provide the full gamut of health services for them.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the agency has this year alone, counselled and rehabilitated 3, 523 drug users mostly through brief interventions in its facilities.\n\n\u201cWe also extended the DPTC training to several NGOs to empower them with the requisite skills and knowledge to cascade the effect to communities and the grassroots.\n\n\u201cGiven the dearth of treatment facilities in the country, it will be impossible to make the kind of gains we are targeting. To this end, we proposed the establishment of model rehabilitation centres to further make treatment accessible and affordable to more people. The good news is that President Muhammadu Buhari graciously, with the support of the National Assembly, approved the establishment of six rehabilitation centres across the country, three of which have been approved in this year\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t stop there. We\u2019re also lobbying the private sector, by encouraging the leading lights in the business community to build or contribute to the development of rehabilitation centres as part of their corporate social responsibility. In this respect, we have gotten some positive, concrete responses as well as strong commitments from other quarters.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman of MTN Foundation and former Minister of Health, Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi, said the Foundation would continue to support the NDLEA in its effort to rid the country of illicit drugs.\n\nOndo NDLEA Seizes 30,000kgs of Drugs, Arrests 294 Suspects in One Year\n\nIn a related development, the NDLEA, Ondo Command yesterday disclosed that it had seized about 30,000kgs of drugs from June 2021 to date.\n\nThe State Commander of NDLEA, Mr. Kayode Raji, stated this in Akure, during a sensitisation and road walk, organised to commemorate the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drugs Trafficking.\n\nRaji said marijuana, puff Shisha, alcoholic drinks and other deadly mixtures, such as \u201cscoochies or skushis\u201d topped the list of the most consumed substances among the youths in the state.\n\nHe noted that other deadly drugs and substances the teenagers also abuse included Rohypnol, \u201cRef\u201d as they call it, \u201cgegemu\u201d, Arizona and Loud, believed to be enhanced Marijuana that produce stronger effect than the regular one.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have made over 30,000 kgs of various hard drugs. We have arrested 294 suspects and out of these, about 65 have been sentenced to various jail terms.\n\n\u201cWe have arrested some people who felt hitherto, they were untouchable and we are still doing more. As a matter of fact, it is gratifying to say that our greatest achievement are the people we\u2019ve taken off drugs.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that the command had counselled over 60 drug addicts and rehabilitated them back to the society as normal human beings.\n\n\u201cSome have been reintegrated back to the society and some of them have even gotten jobs. About three weeks ago, one of the people we rehabilitated in our facility came to give a testimony that he just secured a job in Dubai. It shows that we can do it.\n\n\u201cWe have synergy with higher institutions across the state and we\u2019ve gone to various schools for sensitisation through persuasion and as well, instituted War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) clubs\u201d, Raji stressed.\n\n\u201cSo, drug is evil, it portends evil, it has no good. We are urging everybody to stay from drugs. There is no small or big drug. Starting from cannabis Colorado, monkey tail, Scoochies amongst others.\n\n\u201cWe want people to stay away from it, especially in this part of the country, Scoochies and monkey tail, people see it as giving them energy and boost. It is not good for their health because it spoils their liver, kidney and all parts of their body, ultimately leading to untimely death\u201d, Raji added.",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has assessed the current war being waged against illicit drugs in the country and declared that the days of drug abuse were numbered in Nigeria.\nHe, however said the nation was winning the drug war, adding that the days of the scourge of drug abuse and dependency in the country were numbered.\nThe days of the scourge of drug abuse and dependency are clearly numbered, but it will involve even greater investment in focus and determination for the long haul,\u201d according to the Vice President.\nHis vision and strong resolve have given the war against drug trafficking and abuse new energy, purpose and clearer direction.\n\u201cThe master plan adopts a comprehensive and inclusive approach to addressing issues of drug supply reduction, issues of drug abuse and it has it is based on four thematic pillars, drug supply reduction, demand reduction, access to drug on medical purposes, and governance and coordination.",

          "text": "Nigeria again lost a whopping $650.7 million to crude oil losses resulting from declaration of force majeure, equipment failures and host communities\u2019 disturbances between the April and May production cycle.\n\nWhen converted to naira, the country\u2019s local currency, using the official exchange rate of N420/$, the amount Nigeria lost for the period was an estimated N273,296,023,560.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nOn the average the price per barrel of oil, according to a THISDAY review, sold for approximately $114 last month.\n\nTo put it in proper context, the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue from sales for the entire month of May was N426.14 billion, the highest in months.\n\nThe amount of oil lost during the period extracted from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) excluded the massive volume stolen in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe document detailing the national oil firm\u2019s activities for May, showed that over 5.707 million barrels of oil were lost to the breakdown of production equipment, protest from community workforce arising to shutdowns as well as a fire outbreak at one of the terminals.\n\nStill struggling with meeting its oil production quota, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last week revealed that Nigeria reported a paltry 1.024 million barrels per day production in May, a multi-year low. With the latest figure released by the OPEC, it meant that Nigeria\u2019s underperformance was as high as 700,000 barrels per day for the month, although the cartel\u2019s total allocation to Nigeria exceeded 1.75 million bpd for the month.\n\nThe 1.024 million bpd production (through primary communication) was about 195,000 bpd less production when compared with the April\u2019s total of 1.219 million bpd, OPEC said.\n\nDespite assurances by the various government agencies, what the OPEC figures implied was that rather than improve, the country\u2019s oil production has actually deteriorated in the past months.\n\nAlthough the authorities have always fingered massive theft as one of the reasons for its inability to meet its quota, the areas rarely discussed include incessant equipment failure and prolonged maintenance of broken down facilities.\n\nOn the issue of theft, the federal government had also months ago, deployed heavy military presence in the Niger Delta to curb the menace.\n\nBut the OPEC data confirmed that the action has not made any difference, as nothing appears to have changed since the rejigging of the security arrangement in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the biggest loss for the period, according to the latest NNPC document, came from the force majeure declared at the Bonny terminal since March 2022. For the entire month, Nigeria lost 3.450 million barrels of oil from the facility.\n\nForce majeure refers to a clause in contracts that allows both parties to walk out of the contract when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties happens.\n\nThe report stated that crude oil production at the terminal has now dropped significantly to as low as three million for the period while the terminal operator has temporarily halted operations.\n\nThe next biggest curtailment of production came from Odudu terminal with a total of 937,663 barrels of crude oil shed by the country due to maintenance work on the facility.\n\nIn Yoho and Excravos terminals respectively, the country\u2019s production was curtailed to the tune of 56,000 barrels and 53,000 barrels to low production due to flare management as well as community crisis at the south swamp. Bonga lost 174 barrels to repair work.\n\nFurthermore, Brass lost 180,000 barrels due to a failed equipment, Jones creek terminal lost 809,600 barrels due to shut-in resulting from a combination of broken down equipment and community workers\u2019 protest while Ukpokiti and Aje were curtailed to the tune of 210,000 and 11,000 barrels respectively.\n\nNigeria has some of the most preferred crude in the world since most of it is free of sulphur and remains the largest producer of sweet oil in OPEC. The country\u2019s sweet crude oil is known as Bonny Light.\n\nThe country has a number of petroleum terminals run mostly by International Oil Companies (IOCs) like Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, and Agip.\n\nTHISDAY had reported how with over 3.65 million barrels of crude oil shut-in at the Bonny Terminal during the March/April productions circle, Nigeria\u2019s total losses, month-on-month rose by over 300 per cent.\n\nOverall, between March 3 and April 1, the production curtailment pushed the country\u2019s total loss to 5.545 million barrels of crude for that month as opposed to 1.69 million barrels previously.",

          "title": "Nigeria: FIRS to the Rescue as Subsidy Gulps NNPC\u2019s Revenue",
          "text": "With a major chunk of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited\u2019s (NNPC) monthly revenue now being channeled to the payment of fuel subsidy, the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) now relies heavily on the revenue from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for its monthly sharing to the three tiers of government.\n\nThe 2021 financial records of the FIRS\u2019 contributions to FAAC showed that in the year under review, the federal revenue collecting agency\u2019s contribution was a total of 59.45 per cent, as out of the total of N8.912 trillion to the three tiers of government last year, N5.298 trillion was contributed by the federal revenue collecting agency.\n\nThe trend has continued in the first five months of 2022 as the NNPC\u2019s contribution is still weighed down by the fuel subsidy burden.\n\nThis emerged just as Nigeria again lost a whopping $650.7 million to crude oil losses resulting from declaration of force majeure, equipment failures and host communities\u2019 disturbances between the April and May production cycle.\n\nThe World Bank had estimated that fuel subsidy payment in the country may rise to N5 trillion this year. Last week, President Muhammadu Buhari shut down calls for the removal of petrol subsidy, querying why the West should be demanding that Nigeria ends subsidy payments, while they continue to support their citizens with same to ameliorate the current economic hardship. In May, the NNPC was unable to carry out its statutory obligations to the federation, recording a N704 billion deficit for the year thus far. In its monthly presentation to FAAC for May, the national oil company had disclosed that it deducted another N327.07 billion as shortfall in the month under review. With a projected N1.473 trillion payments to the federation for the entire year and a monthly remittance of N122.767 billion, the implication was that the federal, state and local governments may continue to have cash shortages for a while since the payments constitute a major revenue source. In January, February and March 2022, petrol subsidy gulped 210.38 billion, N219.78 billion, and N245.77 billion, respectively while in April, the country spent N271 billion. These deductions were expected to continue throughout the year.\n\nHowever, a breakdown of the FIRS monthly contribution to FAAC for 2021 showed that in January, it contributed 65.71 per cent (N388.54billion) to FAAC; in February (60.57%) \u2013 N361.26 billion; March (60.01%) \u2013 N501.32 billion; April (59.74%) \u2013 N403.70 billion; May (59.66%) \u2013 N359.77 billion; June (65%) \u2013 N664.30 billion and July (52.03%) \u2013 N397.95 billion.\n\nOther months included August (55.46%) \u2013 N403.85 billion; September (58.8%) \u2013 N516.57 billion; October (57.13%) \u2013 N333.82 billion; November (58.17%) \u2013 N496.19 billion and December (60.43%) \u2013 N470.90 billion.\n\nThe report also showed that in the past three years, the FIRS had been making steady progress in terms of revenue collections as it garnered N5.262 trillion in 2019; N4.952 trillion in 2020 (obviously due to COVID-19) and N6.405 trillion in 2021. It was glaring that the FIRS has been gradually making progress despite the impact of Covid-19, the instability in the oil and gas sector, insecurity in the country and economic downturn.\n\nFindings also revealed that out of the total expenditure incurred by the FIRS during the year 2021, the payment of staff salaries, allowances and other staff-related costs accounted for over 63.6 per cent.\n\nOther key recurrent activities of the Service took 19.2 per cent of the funds, while capital expenditure accounted for only 4.8 per cent of the total fund utilisation for the period under review.\n\nInterestingly, out of the meagre amount received by the apex revenue agency, 12.47 per cent of the total amount received as cost of collection (CoC) was transferred for servicing the capital project account and for the funding of its 13th-month salary to staff.\n\nThe 19.2 per cent which represented other key recurrent activities was spent on fueling and servicing over 272 generators, rent and the rent paid in respect of over 71 rented properties/office accommodation (particularly in Lagos).\n\nThe remaining amount was used for capacity building of over 11,000 workers, fueling and maintaining over 1584 operational vehicles, and payment of Service Level Agreements for security, cleaning, and maintenance of properties and critical equipment in its over 367 operational offices nationwide.\n\nSadly, the agency could only spend 4.8 per cent of its revenue on capital projects. This could be largely attributed to the lack of adequate funding for the critical agency which accounts for well over 60 per cent of the monies distributed to the three tiers of government in the year 2021.\n\nAnalysts believed that in view of the above positive contributions, the agency needs more support from the government than it is currently getting. This, according to them was necessary because of the current peculiar revenue challenge the country was facing as well as in view of some of the global and local challenges being faced by the revenue authorities. These included capital projects started some years ago by FIRS are yet to be completed; some of the agency\u2019s construction sites have been abandoned due to delays in honouring payments certificates; inadequate funding has also made it difficult for the FIRS to adequately build capacity and retrain its officers for modern tax administrative practices; as well as lack of ICT infrastructure necessary to identify and track digital transactions.\n\nSpecifically, FIRS has lots of capital projects it had started (including its Corporate Headquarters which is rated one of the 10 top capital projects in Africa) and could not complete the project for lack of funds.\n\nThe provision of adequate funding would also be necessary because the FIRS would be able to deploy technology and block leakages; generate more revenue to fund the budgetary needs of both local and state governments as well as the federal government at the centre; complete its capital projects (particularly its HQ, prototype offices, training schools etc.) to save it from the current huge rents it pays to landlords for its office accommodations in some major cities; and above all provide more funds for the country as against the current resort to constant borrowing by the government at all levels is unsustainable.\n\nFurthermore, analysts also advised governments at all levels to invest wisely the little that the apex revenue agency currently generates in critical infrastructure, social amenities, safety and security of the citizens.",
