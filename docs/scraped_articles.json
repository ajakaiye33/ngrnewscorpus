          "text": "Words By \u2013 Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nBukola Ayinde is the CEO of Developing People & Ideas -D. P. I Services as well as the Founder, Diary of a Special Needs Mum Initiative under P4:13 Foundation.\n\nThe author of six books including Naked and Not Ashamed, a forty day journal of her experience as a special needs mum, she holds a Bachelor of Laws degree and a Master\u2019s in Managerial Psychology.\n\nBukola, who started out as a litigation lawyer, went on to become a learning and development Consultant, and worked respectively in Human Resources, Marketing and Legal departments of the Intercontinental Bank and Access Bank, in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nThe alumnus of the Fate Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme is today, a Life Coach, Storyteller, disability disability-inclusion and mental health advocate.\n\nAs individuals struggle to gain clarity on their goals and how to achieve them, I sought out Bukola to share with us how her services can be put to use for a harmonious life.\n\nA lot of Nigerians are being exposed to coaching training in recent times. Why do you think we need coaches in our lives?\n\nCoaching in itself is an old profession in human history. When you think of a sports coach, whether for football or track and field, we are used to that. However, when you talk about life coaching, which is, helping people move from where they are to where they need to be, this is relatively new and it originated from the USA over ten years ago.\n\nAccording to Bill Gates, \u201cEverybody needs a coach.\u201d If you need to learn something new, instead of going to gather all the knowledge by yourself, employ a coach who has vast knowledge in that field to guide you. If you are good at something and you need to exceed your potential, you need a coach. A coach can also be like an accountability partner, holding your hand and ensuring you meet your set targets.\n\nIn what aspect of living does a man need a coach the most?\n\nI would say in the area that a person has the most challenges. E.g., for A, it could be that in his career he is a highflier but his marriage is on the verge of collapse. That man should set priority in getting a marriage coach.\n\nHowever, like I have said earlier, he can still get a coach even for his career so that he keeps meeting his career goals.\n\nA look at your profile shows that you have your hands in many pies; what aspect of coaching are you into and which one do you enjoy most?\n\nI will say I wear my hats\u2026\n\nI have written six books, I have produced two documentaries and a short film. I am a mother with a special needs child so I advocate for disability inclusion. Due to my experience as a mother of a special needs child, I have experienced mental health issues such as depression. As a result of that, I also advocate for mental health. My journey to rediscover myself was what led me to become a life coach.\n\nA life coach can work with a client as regards the critical areas of his or her life. What I enjoy most about being a life coach is goal setting. Taking my client from where he or she is, to where they want to be. The joy of seeing my clients achieve their goals is phenomenon.\n\nWe are beginning to understand that all children don\u2019t have the same learning capacity. Should children with learning challenges be lumped in the same class with children who do not have such challenges?\n\nI advocate for inclusive education. My daughter has greatly benefited from inclusive education.\n\n\u201cInclusive education means all children in the same classrooms, in the same schools. It means real learning opportunities for groups who have traditionally been excluded \u2013 not only children with disabilities, but speakers of minority languages too.\u201d \u2013 UNICEF.\n\nAs an advocate for Inclusive education, how should this be done effectively?\n\nThis can be done through differentiated learning. For example, if the students are asked to solve seven sums, a person with a learning disorder can be asked to solve three. The teacher will go at his level and his questions will also take that format. In other cases, the child may also have a shadow teacher seated with him in class, to assist with learning. Another plus for the other students is that, as the teacher is making creative ways to teach the child with a learning disorder, they would also learn better.\n\nHow is coaching different from counselling?\n\nIn counselling, the counselor will need to understand his client to be able to formulate a specific solution to a particular problem; but in coaching, it is primarily present oriented. The coach may know about the client\u2019s past, but the focus is where the client is at now, and where he wants to go. Therefore, for coaching to take place, the client must be able to move on forward from a reasonable stable base. Coaching is not appropriate for the mentally ill, drug addicts, or a person with a history of abuse.\n\nA look at many young people in this country, one can tell all is not well with our youths. Why is it hard for many of them to clarify their goals and how can a life coach help?\n\nIf you go by the youths on social media, you will realise that many youths in Nigeria have one major goal, that is, to leave the country. Another predominant goal is to make a lot of money.\n\nThere is the issue of our belief system and our values: as a person, a family, a community and a nation. If a nation says we value hard work and integrity, they will promote and reward hard work and integrity. This trickles down to all facets of the nation, education, civil service, the family, individuals etc. A lot of youths are disillusioned about their future in Nigeria and this also affects the way they set their goals.\n\nThe best approach to this, is for each individual, each family, to decide what their belief system is, what their values are which must also be in line with the laws and regulations in Nigeria, and other developed countries. Then, set goals that are in alignment with their values and beliefs. Finally, they should put in measures to achieve these goals.\n\nWith the obvious economic hardship being faced in the country and the youth population greatly affected by the lack of job opportunities, how can their stress level be lowered so they can have peace?\n\nThe number one major stressor for many youths is social media! It\u2019s no longer keeping up with the Joneses, it\u2019s now keeping up with social media trends.\n\nWhen I finished Law School, my first legal job as a litigation lawyer paid twenty five thousand naira (N25, 000). I wasn\u2019t thinking about the latest clothes and the weaves. I lived at my level. I wasn\u2019t under any pressure to compete with anybody. What I sought after was how to improve myself and my skills, and before long, I was able to earn much more than where I started from. It will shock you that there are a lot of opportunities out there but we do not have many skilled youths qualified for the positions.\n\nI will say to that youth out there, learn an immediate skill that can earn you money like, digital skills, photography, editing etc while also working on the skills you need to qualify you for your dream job.\n\nHow can parents play their roles better in the home?\n\nUp until the \u201880s and \u201890s, traditionally in Nigeria, the father goes to work and the mother gets a job that allows her close early or she may even be a stay-at-home mum. Things have radically changed from there to having both parents busy making money so that the family can have a good life.\n\nWhen parents know their roles in the family and see themselves working as a team, then they will do all in their power to ensure that everyone on that team succeeds. When a man and a woman realise that they need to support each other and work together to nurture their children, then they have succeeded in their parenting roles.\n\nWhere there is a child with special needs in the family, women often bear the burden of nurturing and parenting. What should be the role of each parent in the life of that child?\n\nI believe strongly that the parents should work together as a team and when one is emotionally low, the other can encourage the partner. Just like how you nurture your neurotypical children, parents should also learn to do the same for children living with special needs.\n\nAs a parent with a special need child, share with us your coping mechanism.\n\nI often tell people that I am not a super woman, what I have is a great support system. My husband supports me greatly and together, we ensure that we have the right caregivers and therapist to work with our child per time. This enables both of us to have time for ourselves and do other things.\n\nAs a neuro-linguistics therapist, what kinds of people come for your services?\n\nNLP- Neuro Linguistics Programming is about how to use the language of the mind to consistently achieve our specific and desired outcomes. It is a set of models, skills, and techniques for thinking and acting effectively in the world.\n\nWhen a client comes to me as an integrative coach, where necessary, I deploy NLP techniques.\n\nFor example, a person who wants to set a health and vitality goal but has sugar cravings, until the sugar cravings are dealt with, the health and vitality goal will not be accomplished. I will deploy some NLP techniques to help the client overcome the sugar carvings then we can go ahead to set goals.\n\nWhat can the government do to support children with special needs?\n\nThe government can do a lot but let\u2019s start with the basics. Therapy and rehabilitation centres can be decentralised to the health centres in local communities. Financial support for indigent families who have children with disabilities will go a long way. Education of the public about people with disabilities so that people living with disabilities are accepted and not demonised in the community.",

          "title": "Anenih, others call for Nigerian Female President",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nIn a bid to attain the nation\u2019s first female president, a former Minister of Women Affairs, Iyom Josephine Anenih called on more Nigerian women to come out and be actively involved in partisan politics, noting that more female state governors should also emerge.\n\nAnenih made this call while delivering the lead paper on the theme, \u201cWomen in Leadership and Governance: Promoting Sustainable Economic Prosperity\u201d, at the 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony held in Lagos recently.\n\nShe asserted that Nigeria wouldn\u2019t attain the transformational changes desired by patriots until a female president emerges.\n\nWhile encouraging women to be more involved in politics, Anineh debunked claims that women lack funds to attain the presidency in the nation.\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-2\n\n\u201cThe truth is that women can\u2019t be in the homes or the other room and expect to become president. No, it\u2019s not by appointment. We are making money in the private sector, so it\u2019s time to invest it in politics. We have very rich women and the assertion that there is no money isn\u2019t true,\u201d Anineh said.\n\nShe noted that women are already actively involved in politics because there is no way women could be on corporate boards as directors without some element of politicking, adding that it is time for them to play politics at the big stage in political parties.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can have the leadership of this country without belonging to a political party. That is what our constitution says. There is no way Nigeria will appoint you President of Nigeria and no one will not appoint you Governor of your state. You have to come out and contest and you cannot contest unless you belong to a political party.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-3\n\n\u201cSo, women, come out, join any political party of your choice, use the power, your energy that you are using to excel in the private sector, in your businesses to excel and come on top in the political party, then you can have a say, then, you can have a ticket to contest, then, you can become a Governor, then, you can become a President.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, efforts to use legislative means to get more quotas for women would be less effective when compared to active participation by women.\n\nOn her part, the BoT Chairperson of MMS Women of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF)Initiative, Mrs. Margaret Orakwusi stated that attaining a female president in the country is the dream of the Initiative even as she lauded the Founder of the Initiative, Kingsley Anaroke for celebrating women for more than ten years.\n\nHer words: \u201cWell, the elections are around the corner and it\u2019s time for women. Somebody said in Nigeria, money plays a huge part, but my position is that we have money because we have husbands and we have sons. Money should not be a problem. We should come together, we should identify those women who will take this country to the higher level and we need to.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-4\n\n\u201cLook at what we are going through in this country, look at our children; drugs are taking over, wickedness, evil taking over. It is our responsibility because a bad child has a mother and as a mother, we are all mothers. So, please, we need to change the narrative, we need to key into Kingsley\u2019s dream and make it possible. Whatever it takes that women take over not just in politics, in commerce, and in everything, that we require to make this nation a great country.\u201d\n\nOrakwusi, however, noted that MMS WoFHoF has been promoting women in commerce, transport, and politics. \u201cIt is Kingsley\u2019s dream and I am sure I am right, to have a female President. He has always given us this beautiful platform to excel by identifying women who have done so much, who have excelled in their chosen profession not just in the maritime sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the occasion, Princess Dr. Vicky Haastrup observed that Nigerian women had the capacity to provide solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, stressing that male presidents have failed the country since its independence.\n\n\u201cWe have got to that point where Nigeria recognizes that men have failed us. Women should take over by becoming President, Governors, and everything possible. We are getting there by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nHaastrup who is also the Chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) commended Mrs. Josephine Anenih for supporting Mrs. Patience Jonathan amid calls for 30 percent women inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe moment women in Nigeria become Governors, become Senators, how many women senators do we have in Nigeria? How many of them are in the House of Reps.? Things must change, women in Nigeria, you must rise up to the occasion. You must empower yourselves, you must be ready. We are not going to fight but we will slug it out with men.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021\n\nA former Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, ACG Charles Edike stressed that the recent trend which has seen more Nigerian women as Managing Directors of commercial banks and other multinationals could easily spill into politics with the emergence of the first Nigerian female president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day Nigeria will have a female president. There are many of them around the world and most of them have been very successful. It\u2019s time to give women the space. If we create an enabling environment for a Nigerian female president, we would be amazed at the wonders God will do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are being celebrated today because they are achievers and we expect that this celebration will spur them to do better. This will also motivate others to be successful in their respective fields. Women have proven to be better managers of human and financial resources. Purpose-driven women always make judicious use of their resources and they multiply it. God created them like that.\u201d Edike said.\n\nThe Founder of the MMS WoFHoF Initiative, Mr. Kingsley Anaroke reiterated that men have failed Nigeria for several generations.\n\nHis words: \u201cCan we try women? There may have been cases of one or two disappointments within the female folk. However, when you place them side-by-side with men, we have had more men failures than women. I believe in a woman for the presidency. A woman can lead and let the men guide. What we have done here today is to mainstream women in leadership and governance. A woman who finds herself in a corrupting environment wouldn\u2019t be as corrupt as the men.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with MMS Plus on the sidelines, three of the 2021 inductees; the President of Women\u2019s International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA) Nigeria, Mrs. Eunice Ezeoke, President of Jami\u2019yyan Matan Arewa (JMA), Hajia Rabi Musa Saulama, and a Governing Board Member of the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM), Dr. Mrs. Yetunde Akinluyi affirmed that the time is ripe to achieve a first female Nigerian president.\n\nThe 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony, which was held at the Golden Gate Hotel Ikoyi, was graced by top women in the nation\u2019s transport and finance sectors, as well as eminent female politicians, amongst other dignitaries.",

          "title": "Anenih, others call for Nigerian Female President",
          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nIn a bid to attain the nation\u2019s first female president, a former Minister of Women Affairs, Iyom Josephine Anenih called on more Nigerian women to come out and be actively involved in partisan politics, noting that more female state governors should also emerge.\n\nAnenih made this call while delivering the lead paper on the theme, \u201cWomen in Leadership and Governance: Promoting Sustainable Economic Prosperity\u201d, at the 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony held in Lagos recently.\n\nShe asserted that Nigeria wouldn\u2019t attain the transformational changes desired by patriots until a female president emerges.\n\nWhile encouraging women to be more involved in politics, Anineh debunked claims that women lack funds to attain the presidency in the nation.\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-2\n\n\u201cThe truth is that women can\u2019t be in the homes or the other room and expect to become president. No, it\u2019s not by appointment. We are making money in the private sector, so it\u2019s time to invest it in politics. We have very rich women and the assertion that there is no money isn\u2019t true,\u201d Anineh said.\n\nShe noted that women are already actively involved in politics because there is no way women could be on corporate boards as directors without some element of politicking, adding that it is time for them to play politics at the big stage in political parties.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can have the leadership of this country without belonging to a political party. That is what our constitution says. There is no way Nigeria will appoint you President of Nigeria and no one will not appoint you Governor of your state. You have to come out and contest and you cannot contest unless you belong to a political party.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-3\n\n\u201cSo, women, come out, join any political party of your choice, use the power, your energy that you are using to excel in the private sector, in your businesses to excel and come on top in the political party, then you can have a say, then, you can have a ticket to contest, then, you can become a Governor, then, you can become a President.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, efforts to use legislative means to get more quotas for women would be less effective when compared to active participation by women.\n\nOn her part, the BoT Chairperson of MMS Women of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF)Initiative, Mrs. Margaret Orakwusi stated that attaining a female president in the country is the dream of the Initiative even as she lauded the Founder of the Initiative, Kingsley Anaroke for celebrating women for more than ten years.\n\nHer words: \u201cWell, the elections are around the corner and it\u2019s time for women. Somebody said in Nigeria, money plays a huge part, but my position is that we have money because we have husbands and we have sons. Money should not be a problem. We should come together, we should identify those women who will take this country to the higher level and we need to.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021-4\n\n\u201cLook at what we are going through in this country, look at our children; drugs are taking over, wickedness, evil taking over. It is our responsibility because a bad child has a mother and as a mother, we are all mothers. So, please, we need to change the narrative, we need to key into Kingsley\u2019s dream and make it possible. Whatever it takes that women take over not just in politics, in commerce, and in everything, that we require to make this nation a great country.\u201d\n\nOrakwusi, however, noted that MMS WoFHoF has been promoting women in commerce, transport, and politics. \u201cIt is Kingsley\u2019s dream and I am sure I am right, to have a female President. He has always given us this beautiful platform to excel by identifying women who have done so much, who have excelled in their chosen profession not just in the maritime sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the occasion, Princess Dr. Vicky Haastrup observed that Nigerian women had the capacity to provide solutions to the nation\u2019s problems, stressing that male presidents have failed the country since its independence.\n\n\u201cWe have got to that point where Nigeria recognizes that men have failed us. Women should take over by becoming President, Governors, and everything possible. We are getting there by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nHaastrup who is also the Chairman, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) commended Mrs. Josephine Anenih for supporting Mrs. Patience Jonathan amid calls for 30 percent women inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cThe moment women in Nigeria become Governors, become Senators, how many women senators do we have in Nigeria? How many of them are in the House of Reps.? Things must change, women in Nigeria, you must rise up to the occasion. You must empower yourselves, you must be ready. We are not going to fight but we will slug it out with men.\u201d\n\nMMS Hall of Fame Induction 2021\n\nA former Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, ACG Charles Edike stressed that the recent trend which has seen more Nigerian women as Managing Directors of commercial banks and other multinationals could easily spill into politics with the emergence of the first Nigerian female president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day Nigeria will have a female president. There are many of them around the world and most of them have been very successful. It\u2019s time to give women the space. If we create an enabling environment for a Nigerian female president, we would be amazed at the wonders God will do with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are being celebrated today because they are achievers and we expect that this celebration will spur them to do better. This will also motivate others to be successful in their respective fields. Women have proven to be better managers of human and financial resources. Purpose-driven women always make judicious use of their resources and they multiply it. God created them like that.\u201d Edike said.\n\nThe Founder of the MMS WoFHoF Initiative, Mr. Kingsley Anaroke reiterated that men have failed Nigeria for several generations.\n\nHis words: \u201cCan we try women? There may have been cases of one or two disappointments within the female folk. However, when you place them side-by-side with men, we have had more men failures than women. I believe in a woman for the presidency. A woman can lead and let the men guide. What we have done here today is to mainstream women in leadership and governance. A woman who finds herself in a corrupting environment wouldn\u2019t be as corrupt as the men.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with MMS Plus on the sidelines, three of the 2021 inductees; the President of Women\u2019s International Shipping and Trading Association (WISTA) Nigeria, Mrs. Eunice Ezeoke, President of Jami\u2019yyan Matan Arewa (JMA), Hajia Rabi Musa Saulama, and a Governing Board Member of the Nigerian Institute of Management (NIM), Dr. Mrs. Yetunde Akinluyi affirmed that the time is ripe to achieve a first female Nigerian president.\n\nThe 2021 MMS Woman of Fortune Hall of Fame (WoFHoF) Induction Ceremony, which was held at the Golden Gate Hotel Ikoyi, was graced by top women in the nation\u2019s transport and finance sectors, as well as eminent female politicians, amongst other dignitaries.",

          "title": "The Rave On Fire",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nAdedamola Adefolahun, professionally known as Fireboy DML, is no doubt having one of the best times of his most loved career.\n\nAfter a major breakthrough with his debut album Laughter, Tears and Goosebumps\u2019, in 2019, Fireboy kept up his prolific pace this year, with the launch of his latest hit single \u2018Peru\u2019, a song currently on the lips of the young and young at heart.\n\nThe singer and songwriter, who has a song for every feeling from love, breakup, happiness to travel, says the song \u2018Peru\u2019 basically recounts his journey and holiday fun in San Francisco.\n\nAs he takes on Lagos today, January 2nd for his first major headline concert tagged \u201cThe Fire Concert\u201d at the Balmoral, Federal Palace hotel Lagos, the English Language graduate of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, says he is optimistic about the future of the new year, with regards to satisfying fans.\n\nFireboy, who carted home the highest number of awards at the 2021 Headies, shares his excitement on the \u2018Fireboy Concert, his latest collaboration with British high-profile singer Ed Sheeran and influences while growing up, among others.\n\nYou are headlining your first concert ever in Lagos \u201cThe Fire Concert\u201d How does that make you feel?\n\nEcstatic and anxious! I can\u2019t wait for that night on the 2nd of January, 2022. I\u2019ll be performing many songs I\u2019ve never performed before so it\u2019s going to be super special.\n\nTell us about your latest album? What is the inspiration behind it?\n\nI made my sophomore album during the lockdown in 2020, with the sole purpose of giving my listeners a little peek into my life and personality. My debut was simply an introduction to my sound so I decided to make the next one a bit more personal and introspective.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind your latest hit \u2018Peru\u2019, how did it come about?\n\nThere is no particular depth to it, to be honest. It was a drunken freestyle\u2014just a young man who had found himself in a foreign land and had decided to enjoy every single minute of his experience there. I was simply telling my truth in melody. I had just landed in San Francisco to pay a courtesy visit to my empire team in the studio. I met Shizzi there, told him to play me a beat and that was it. In 40 minutes, \u2018Peru\u2019 was born.\n\nAnd how would you describe the reception so far?\n\nAmazing! The song has gone on to become a global smash hit! Right now, it\u2019s my biggest song yet. I am super grateful to God, my team and to the fans, media houses, and every stakeholder of the afrobeat genre who made this possible.\n\nTell us about the remix with English singer Ed Sheeran, why Ed?\n\nWhen the team told me it was time to push Peru even further globally, I told them I wouldn\u2019t do a remix with just anybody, no matter how big they were. I\u2019m big on mutual respect and organic energy when it comes to collaborations, so I waited patiently till it came. When the opportunity presented itself, I knew Ed was the one for this song, because he genuinely loves the song and also because I have been a fan of his, for as long as I remember, so I connect with his sound. He made me fall in love with acoustic guitars, and then when we met and shot the video, the energy was amazing. I am super grateful to have him on this project.\n\nHow would you say your style has evolved since the beginning of your career?\n\nFor me, every album is a different era. LTG was the boyish lover boy who just wanted everyone to listen to his sound; APOLLO was the deep, reclusive guy in his introspective bag. This era is different. This is the guy who is more comfortable sonically, the guy who is out of his comfort zone, and more open to different possibilities. My next album will be my most commercial album yet.\n\nWho helped you most in your journey?\n\nOlamide, without a doubt, is a mentor and guide I can never replace. I am forever grateful to him.\n\nWhere and how do you get inspiration for your songs?\n\nFor me, there are no particular perimeters with music-making. As long as I can hear the sound and it\u2019s pleasing to me, inspiration and every other thing comes naturally, it just flows. I can\u2019t explain it.\n\nIs there a particular place where you feel most creative?\n\nAnywhere music plays. I like to constantly surround myself with music and anything that has to do with it keeps me in a constantly creative zone and headspace.\n\nDo you have any hobbies or interests outside of music?\n\nI love football a lot. I love playing and watching. Once a week, I play football with my friends, we even set up a sort of \u201cfootball club\u201d and yes, your guess is right, I am the captain of the team. I also love video games; it\u2019s one of those things I do to unwind. I don\u2019t like going out so it\u2019s mainly indoor activities I do to keep me relaxed. I love to read a lot, and occasionally I write poetry.\n\nWhat strengths do you have that you believe make you a great musician?\n\nSongwriting for sure, I think it\u2019s what sets me apart. I strongly believe that the ability to make music is more important than pure singing ability. Nothing beats being intentional with music-making, and no better way to make music than being an amazing songwriter.\n\nWhich famous musicians do you admire?\n\nI admire a lot of musicians for different reasons but three people stand out for me, and I consider them the foundation of my sound; Passenger, Jon Bellion, and Wande Coal. I admire them for the soul and honesty they bring into songwriting.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem you have encountered in the journey of music?\n\nThe complexity of human beings makes it so difficult to navigate this journey, but the passion and love I have for the craft makes it easy for me to overlook these things. We move, regardless.\n\nIf you could change one thing in the music industry in Nigeria, what would it be and Why?\n\nOur industry is beautiful at the moment, but I think we could do with a better structure. We are definitely getting there, we just need more time.\n\nDo you feel that you chose your \u201cpassion,\u201d or did it choose you?\n\nIt definitely chose me, because I thought my passion would be something else. In the middle of the chaos that was my life, music found me and I found purpose.\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t chosen your field, what would your alternate field have been?\n\nProbably a professional footballer or a professional writer, it\u2019s a weird combo but it is what it is.\n\nWhat accomplishments do you see yourself achieving in the next five to 10 years?\n\nFor myself and for afrobeat, I see myself becoming a bigger and better proponent of the genre, performing on the biggest stages, and becoming a legend.\n\nIt\u2019s Christmas, what does Christmas mean to you and what\u2019s your wish this Xmas?\n\nEven as a kid I was always indoors, probably reading a book or something. But I always loved the atmosphere Christmas brings. There is some sort of peace and joy in the air that I can\u2019t explain and it\u2019s beautiful to see. Right now, I\u2019m all about spreading positive energy and bringing genuine smiles to the faces of my fans and family, with music and genuine affection. My Xmas wish is for this pandemic to completely go away.\n\nTell us your New Year resolutions for 2022 and your plans for the year?\n\nI have no resolutions. As for my plans, I have a lot! I\u2019m having my first headline concert in January, and doing my first USA tour in February. In the 2nd quarter, I will be in Europe touring. After that, I\u2019ll start working on releasing my third album. I\u2019m almost done with it at this moment.\n\nWhat is your motto or good advice you live by?\n\nGood things take time, great things take everything.\n\nTell us a bit about where you were born, your growing up, and how that impacted your career today?\n\nI was born and raised in Ogun state. I grew up in Abeokuta, with my parents and two brothers. As the firstborn, I was always the quiet and responsible one. I never went out or had too many friends and it has shaped me into this reclusive creative. I like it that way, it helps me focus and it keeps me away from a lot of energy I do not need.\n\nWhat is one message you would give to your fans?\n\nThank you for staying with me through this journey. I love you and I can\u2019t wait for you all to experience my next album. Stay masked up this period, and stay close to your loved ones.\n\nHave a happy New Year.",

Our state commission will collaborate with the Federal Commission so that we do not occupy that false place in this area.\n\n\u201cWe would like to occupy the first in many areas, but not in fraud and Yahoo Yahoo.\n\nSpeaking on kidnapping along the Ogun-Oyo corridors, Abiodun revealed that he had spoken with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to \u201cjointly collaborate in the area of providing security at the border posts\u201d between the two states.\n\nHe added that Makinde had concluded plans to be in Ogun with his team of law enforcement architecture, for a plan on how to fish out the hoodlums.",

          "title": "Decision on petrol subsidy removal to come in June \u2013NEC",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nDecision on removal of subsidy on petroleum would be made in June when the provision for its payment in the 2022 budget expires, the National Economic Council (NEC), has said.\n\nResponding to questions while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of the meeting, Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdulahi Sule, said it was understandable that the provision for the payment of the subsidy is made in the 2022 budget only until June.\n\nSule, who briefed alongside his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, said any decision on removal of subsidy would be taken after the budget provision runs its course in June.\n\nHe said though NEC, through a committee it has set up on the issue, has been having a conversation on the matter, it was yet to take a stand on it.\n\nNassarawa governor said: \u201cWhat you have to understand is that we didn\u2019t make any presentation on this because there has not been a decision. But in reality, all of us Nigerians know that there is now the Petroleum Industry Act. And NNPC has now become a limited liability company. So, NNPC will run differently. So, if the minister of finance provides for six months, you probably can understand part of the reason for provision of six months before NNPC fully takes off and at that moment, that\u2019s when decisions will be made.\n\n\u201cBut I want to make the correction that it is not governors who are making recommendations. It is actually a NEC committee, you know, which comprises of all the other people that are looking at this and no decision has been made and probably by the time a decision will be made, you know, the Petroleum Industry Act would have fully taken charge, and it will not require any recommendation from anybody.\u201d\n\nAlso responding to questions, Obaseki pointed out that Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), which sells for N162-165 per litre in Nigeria, sells for over 100 percent higher in neighbouring countries.\n\nHe said the Federal Government was spending about N2 trillion on petroleum subsidy, an amount he said could have been channelled to the nation\u2019s infrastructure, education, healthcare among others.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAccording to Obaseki, the NEC, therefore, wondered whether that should be allowed to continue in a situation where he observed only two thirds of the states of the federation consume the subsidy.\n\n\u201cAs you all know and aware, the issue of subsidy has been one matter that NEC has deliberated on, for more than a year now. There was an ad hoc committee, which was set up by NEC headed by Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State that included members of the executive who worked on recommendations as to what we should do about the costs of PMS locally because as you realise, as has been told us, the cost of PMS in Nigeria today is about N162 per litre. Whereas every other country surrounding Nigeria is selling the same product at more than 100 percent of the cost in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to have the exact figures, but we must have spent almost N2 trillion subsidising petroleum products. That is money that could have gone into building roads, money that could have gone into healthcare and education. And so for NEC, the arguments have been put out, should we continue this regime of spending money we do not have to subsidise the living standards of only mostly those who have vehicles? \u201cAnd when NEC looked at some of the analysis last year, we then realised less than one third of the states of this country consume two thirds of the subsidy. So, the issue of equity also came up. All of these findings were presented to NEC and NEC has had several deliberations. And the deliberations are still ongoing. So, NEC has not come up with any decision yet. I think recommendations have also been made to the president. That is what I am aware has transpired so far.\u201d\n\nAsked if complaints of governors on illegal deductions to pay subsidy was addressed, Obaseki said: \u201cNo, no, no no. What was presented to NEC today was a document for us to note the decision that was reached by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\n\u201cThey had met, they had brought up the constitutional issue about deductions of 13 percent derivation, which should have occurred before any expenditure. So, this was a constitutional issue, which had been dealt with. And it was realised refunds had to be made as a result of those unconstitutional deductions and it was agreed how those refunds should be paid whether it was to be paid in three years or in four years or in five years. That was what was brought to NEC for noting.\u201d\n\nAsked how subsidy deductions was affecting states, the Edo governor said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll put it very succinctly\u2026as at last year, NNPC was supposed to contribute N200 billion a month to FAAC for distribution to the states. But because of the payment of subsidy, NNPC was unable to put that money into FAAC for distribution, which means less money going to the states and less money going to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nOn if states can survive, Nasarawa Governor responded, \u201cwe are surviving now.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari: El-Rufai is Writing His History in Letters of Gold",
          "text": "*Vows never to let anyone impose himself on Nigerians\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, while inaugurating some projects in different parts of Kaduna State, gave a generous pass mark to the Northwestern state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, saying he was writing history in letters of gold.\n\nBuhari, who confessed to having taken El-Rufai\u2019s loyalty for granted, and went on to profusely thank him, however, vowed never to let anyone raise an army of thugs with a view to forcing himself on Nigerians, as the nation journeys through the next national elections.\n\nThe president was in Kaduna for a two-day working visit, and arrived Wednesday night from Banjul, Gambia, where he attended the inauguration of President Adama Barrow, for a second term of office.\n\nBuhari, who flew in a helicopter, landed at the Murtala Square and commissioned the remodelled Square.\n\nReceived by El-Rufai and top government functionaries, the president commenced his activities in Kafanchan, where he commissioned some road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme, before returning to Kaduna at about 11:45am.\n\nAt the Murtala Square, the new city centre of Kaduna State, the president, while admiring the remodelled edifice, recalled that he was constrained by family challenges to relocate from Daura to Kaduna, after he was released from detention as a former military Head of State.\n\n\u201dI can hardly find my way in Kaduna due to the development taking place here and the governor, has committed himself to change Kaduna for good and has been very successful at that, and Nigerians are appreciative that you are writing your history in letters of gold,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet, another instance, an overly impressed Buhari added: \u201cThank you very much, Your Excellency, and remarkably, you became my governor. I don\u2019t think I have any input. Zainab became my minister of finance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you are from the gentleman I respect and go to his house (apparently referring to El-Rufai). This is fabulous coincidence and I thank God for it. Therefore, I have taken your loyalty for granted,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nStill in Kafanchan, Buhari underlined his resolve to consolidate the country\u2019s political system to improve the quality of the people\u2019s lives, because \u201cthe people matter.\u201d\n\nAddressing the palace of Alhaji Muhammadu Isa II, the Emir of Jama\u2019a, Buhari said, \u201cWe are doing our efforts to consolidate the system for the good of the people because they matter.\u201d\n\nHe used the opportunity to speak about the use of the police and the military, in dealing with security situations but urged Nigerians to develop confidence in civil authority to build a system \u201cfree of chaos.\u201d\n\nBuhari, therefore, reiterated that, \u201cNobody should be allowed to raise an army of thugs to force himself on the people. This must be very clear.\u201d\n\nThe president further gave assurances of the determination of his administration \u201cto hand over a better Nigeria than the one we inherited,\u201d and urged Nigerians to be fair in their assessment of what his government has achieved especially, on the campaign promises he made ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nThe president, who inaugurated the newly remodelled Murtala Mohammed Square, also unveiled the 136-bed Infectious Disease Hospital, LEA Lokoja Road Primary School, Rigasa, Aliyu Makama road and the Leventis underpass, executed by the State government.\n\nHe praised Governor El-Rufai for completing people-oriented projects in the Kaduna metropolis as well as other senatorial districts in the state.\n\nAlso, while inaugurating the 800-metre long flyover in Kawo, Kaduna, amid tight security, the president recounted how he narrowly escaped a targeted bomb attack in the vicinity in 2014.\n\nReminiscing on the unfortunate incident, which claimed the lives of many innocent Nigerians, Buhari thanked God for sparing his life on that fateful day along Ali Akilu road, Kawo-Kaduna.\n\nHis words: \u201dFor many years, I always plied this route and I cannot recount how many times I crossed it. There was an attempt on my life on this road. Nothing happened to me just like the 30 months I spent during the civil war.\n\n\u201dThey wanted to blow up the vehicle I was in around the secretariat but my escort somehow stopped them. But before we came to this bridge (Kawo), they became more desperate and there was a small market in the area, where the device exploded. But God protected us and here I am again,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter commissioning the newly constructed Dan Haya Road, Katsina Road and the Emir\u2019s Palace Road in Kafanchan, Buhari, Buhari stated again, \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the rehabilitation of the town (Kafanchan) I have seen.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents of the area to show appreciation for the projects, and commended the Emir, for his consolidation of peace among the diverse ethnic and religious communities of the Emirate.\n\nIn his remarks, El-Rufa\u2019i acknowledged the President\u2019s investments in security in the area, noting in particular that the establishment of security outfits, had paved the way for reduced attacks on people, stating categorically that Kafanchan was much safer today than it used to be.\n\nThe Emir, in acknowledging the improvements in security in the area, requested permanent bases for the Air Force and the Mobile Police, as well as the restoration of the rail services for which Kafanchan was known.\n\nBuhari was welcomed to the community by the Senator and Members of the House of Representatives from the zone, as well as a large crowd of enthusiastic citizens, who thronged the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, a combined team of heavily armed soldiers and the police were deployed to strategic places in the state while helicopters were seen hovering around the city.\n\nKaduna is one of the northwest states under constant attacks by bandits with people being killed or abducted almost on a daily basis.\n\nBuhari is expected to be in Zaria today to commission more road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme.\n\nCuriously, however, the visit was without the usual fanfare and celebrations as not many people came out on the street to welcome him.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert heavy strain on the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is proposing a $50 billion trust fund which could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to build resilience and sustainability.\n\nThe trust fund is part of IMF\u2019s options for channeling some of the $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued in August 2021 to countries with strong external financial positions as well as vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).\n\nThe IMF in a new blog post yesterday, stated that the proposed $50 billion trust fund could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries build resilience to balance of payments shocks and ensure a sustainable recovery\n\nIt stated that about three quarters of IMF\u2019s membership could qualify for the RST financing, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and all middle-income countries with per capita gross national income (GNI) below 10 times the 2020\n\nInternational Development Association (IDA) operational cut-off , or about $12,000.\n\nNigeria falls within the category of potential beneficiaries as\n\nGNI per capita in the country was reported at $2,157 in 2019, based on the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognised sources.\n\nTo qualify for RST support, an eligible IMF member would need a package of high-quality policy measures consistent with the RST\u2019s purpose; a concurrent financing or non-financing IMF-supported programme with appropriate macroeconomic policies to mitigate risks for borrowers and creditors; and sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the Fund.\n\nThe IMF noted that access to RST financing would be determined case-by-case, based on the strength of reforms and debt sustainability considerations, and was expected to be capped at 150 per cent of IMF quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is smaller.\n\nIt added that RST lending would be part of a broader financing strategy members would pursue to address longer-term balance of payments risks, involving a mix of multilateral, bilateral official, and private financing.\n\nLike the IMF\u2019s highly concessional and currently zero interest rate Trust for low-income countries, the RST\u2019s resources would be mobilised on a voluntary basis from members who wish to channel their SDRs or currencies for the benefit of poorer or vulnerable countries.\n\nThe IMF stated: \u201cEven as countries continue to battle COVID-19, it is crucial not to overlook the longer-term challenge of transforming economies to become more resilient to shocks and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has taught us that not addressing these long-term challenges in a timely manner can have significant economic consequences, with the potential for future balance of payments problems.\n\n\u201cClimate change is another long-term challenge that threatens macroeconomic stability and growth in many countries through natural disasters and disruptions to industries, job markets, and trade flows, among others.\n\n\u201cThese are global public policy challenges, and it is the shared responsibility of individual countries and the international community to take timely actions.\u201d\n\nThe Fund noted that in a previous blog, it had explained how it was considering options for channeling some of the $650 billion SDRs issued in August 2021 from countries with strong external financial positions to vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust.\n\nIt added that the RST\u2019s central objective was to provide affordable long-term financing to support countries as they tackle structural challenges.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve continued to work toward developing the RST, our current thinking on the key design features\u2014which we outline further below\u2014aim to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowing countries.\n\n\u201cWith broad support from the membership and international partners, we hope that the Trust can be approved by the IMF Executive Board before the upcoming Spring Meetings and for it to become fully operational before the year\u2019s end,\u201d the IMF stated in the blog post.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NEC: Fuel Subsidy Stays for Now, But May Be Removed Before Year End",
          "text": "*Says petrol costs 100% more in neighbouring countries\n\n*Reveals that N2trn spent on subsidy in 2021\n\n*Accuses NNPC of failing to fund FAAC to the tune of N200bn monthly in 2021\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe National Economic Council (NEC) yesterday allayed fears of Nigerians about the possible removal of fuel subsidy early in 2022, saying the policy would remain for now.\n\nIt, however, did not rule out the possibility of the subsidy being removed before the end of this year.\n\nThese formed part of the resolutions of NEC at its maiden meeting in 2022 held at the Conference Hall of the State House, Abuja, with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo presiding.\n\nNEC which meets monthly is constitutionally empowered to advise the president on nation\u2019s economic matters.\n\nThe federal government had disclosed plan to phase out the fuel subsidy regime by the second half of this year.\n\nThe World Bank had also last November sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see the federal and state governments unable to pay salaries this year.\n\nBut a member of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Economic Advisory Council, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, recently warned that some of the economic reforms outlined by the federal government in 2022, especially the fuel subsidy removal, may be hampered by political considerations and labour union activities.\n\nHowever, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa state and his Edo state counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, were on hand to brief newsmen at the end of the meeting that lasted for four hours.\n\nWhen asked if fuel subsidy removal was discussed at the meeting, Obaseki said though Council discussed the issue, no decision was taken on the matter.\n\nHe added that statistics had shown that over N2 trillion was spent on fuel subsidy in 2021, while reports had also shown that prices of petroleum products were 100 percent higher in neighboring countries than what is obtainable in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe issue of subsidy has been one matter that NEC has deliberated on, for more than a year now. There was an Adhoc Committee which was set up by NEC headed by Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna state that included members of the executive arm of government that worked on recommendations as to what we should do about the costs of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) locally because as you realise, as has been told us, the cost of PMS in Nigeria today is about N162 per liter. Whereas every other country surrounding Nigeria is selling the same product at more than 100 per cent of the cost in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd the country as at last year, spent in excess of almost, I mean, we need to have the exact figures, but we must have spent almost N2 trillion subsidising petroleum products. That is money that could have gone into building roads, money that could have gone into healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cSo, for NEC, the arguments have been put out, should we continue this regime of spending money we do not have to subsidise the living standards of only mostly those who have vehicles? And when NEC looked at some of the analysis last year, we then realised that less than one-third of the states of this country consume two thirds of the subsidy. So, the issue of equity also came up.\n\n\u201cAll of these findings were presented to NEC and NEC has had several deliberations. And the deliberations are still ongoing.\n\n\u201cSo, NEC hasn\u2019t come up with any decision yet. I think recommendations have also been made to the President. That is what I am aware of that transpired so far.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Nasarawa state governor emphasised that no decision had been taken on the issue of fuel subsidy.\n\nHe added that with the NNPC now becoming a limited liability company, it would now have to run differently in the area of fuel pricing regime.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that we didn\u2019t make any presentations on the fuel subsidy because there has not been a decision. But in reality, all of us Nigerians know that there is now the Petroleum Industry Act. And NNPC has now become, you know, a limited liability company. So NNPC will run differently.\n\n\u201cSo, if the Minister of Finance, you know, provides for six months, you probably can understand part of the reason for provision of six months before NNPC fully takes off and at that moment, that\u2019s when decisions will be made.\n\n\u201cBut I want to make the correction that it is not governors who are making recommendations. It is actually a NEC committee, you know, which comprises of all the other people that are looking at this and no decision has been made.\n\n\u201cProbably at the appropriate time, a decision will be made. You know, the Petroleum Industry Act has fully taken charge, and it will not require any recommendation from anybody\u201d.\n\nAsked if NEC took any decision on the complaints of governors about unconstitutional deductions, Sule stated that what was presented to NEC was a document on the decision that was reached by the Federal Revenue Allocation Committee (FAAC)\n\nHe explained that FAAC brought up the constitutional issue about deductions of 13 per cent derivation, which should have occurred before any expenditures.\n\nThe governor stressed that this was a constitutional issue, which had been dealt with.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd it was realised that refunds had to be made as a result of those unconstitutional deductions and it was agreed how those refunds should be paid back whether it was to be paid in three years or in four years or in five years.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Edo state governor put it succinctly that the deductions had really affected the states financially.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cAs at last year, NNPC was supposed to contribute N200 billion a month to FAAC for distribution to the States. Because of payment of subsidy, NNPC was unable to put that money into FAAC for distribution, which means less money going to the states and less money going to the federal government.\u201d\n\nFG Cannot Push Consequences of its Inefficiency to Nigerians, Says NLC President\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday insisted that the planned removal of petrol subsidy by the federal government was tantamount to leaving Nigerians to bear the consequence of in-built inefficiency in the product supply value chain.\n\nSpeaking on a national television yesterday, the National President of the NLC, Mr Ayuba Waba, reiterated the body\u2019s earlier decision to embark on a warning protest on January 27, over the matter.\n\nWabba maintained that the removal of subsidy would cause more pains to Nigerians and push millions into poverty, arguing that as it is, inflation has also already rendered wages and salaries valueless.\n\nThe NLC helmsman noted that the federal government cannot be talking about subsidy removal when it imports all its products, explaining that the first point to start is to begin local refining.\n\nHe posited that the refineries have not worked for years because there are certain highly placed individuals who benefit from the importation of products.\n\nHe pointed out that labour had engaged government for the past 20 years over the matter and proffered solutions, including building the country\u2019s refining capacity.\n\n\u201cWe must be able to refine product for domestic use, and that is what most OPEC countries are doing. We should not rely 100 per cent on importation of petrol and other petroleum products.\n\n\u201cOne, we\u2019re exporting our jobs, not only exporting jobs, we are also imposing a burden on many Nigerians. In fact, we can take over the entire West Africa markets if we\u2019re able to refine products for domestic use,\u201d he noted.\n\nWabba explained that while the government may have started work on the Port Harcourt refinery, all the refineries are still moribund, adding that government has broken its promises several times in the past to revamp the facilities.\n\nAccording to him, modular refineries can actually address the perennial issue of shortage of gas and diesel and also bring down the price which has continued to rise as well as pushing the prices of foodstuff beyond ordinary Nigerians.\n\n\u201cDiesel is almost going for between N340 per litre and N360, depending on where you\u2019re buying. And then it will make transportation so expensive, and therefore costs of goods and services that will also depend on transportation. Those costs will be built into it. So, those are the issues.\n\n\u201cThere is confusion. How much of petrol do we consume? Do we know? And that is why we have said that the inefficiency that is in the system should not actually be transferred to consumers to continue to carry,\u201d he explained.\n\nWabba opined that government\u2019s position that the high volume of consumption is due to products that are being smuggled across the borders does not hold water, stating that it will take hundreds of tankers to take that volume out of the country.\n\n\u201cIf you are to look at the gap between 38 million litres and 102 million litres, it means that on a daily basis, 200 trucks will be smuggling products across the country. And this is an issue we have interrogated in the past.\n\n\u201cWe have given recommendation, the first is that they must build refineries around those borders, so that we can also take a comparative advantage of all the neighbouring countries, but today, nothing has happened.\n\n\u201cSo basically, clearly there is no transparency and therefore the issue of how much we consume per day is still a mystery. And this is not rocket science,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to him, the use of an alternative fuel like compressed natural gas to reduce the number of vehicles that use petrol has also been left hanging.\n\n\u201cTo use natural gas, I remember that about N260 billion was actually committed to the issue of conversion of vehicles. But there\u2019s nothing on the table. So that\u2019s why everybody\u2019s concerned that promises have been made and we have documentation, we have reports, but none of those promises are being kept. So it\u2019s a vicious cycle,\u201d he posited.\n\nAlso, ahead of the January 27 nationwide protest against the purported plan to remove fuel subsidy, the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) said that its branches all over the country had adequately mobilised in line with the directive of the NLC for the protest.\n\nSpeaking at its 41st Regular National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State yesterday, SSANU President, Mr. Mohammed Haruna Ibrahim, accused the federal government of not being sensitive to the pains the citizens were going through while taking its decisions.\n\nIbrahim said as an affiliate of the NLC, SSANU would participate actively in the proposed protest.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the next few days, the Nigeria Labour Congress is mobilising all Nigerian workers both formal and informal to protest this evil and very unpatriotic thought of removing fuel subsidy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have it in good authority that about N200 will be added to the N162 or N170 depending on where you are buying as fuel price in Nigeria. This, the NLC in which SSANU is an affiliate, totally rejects and will participate fully in this protest across Nigeria on the 27th of this month.\n\n\u201cThe present federal government of Nigeria is not doing any better in its relationship with our labour unions. SSANU in particular is facing the most difficult period of its existence because our members are going through a lot in terms of hardship, in terms of denial.\n\n\u201cWe have had a 2009 agreement which is about 12 years down the line, just less than 40 per cent of that agreement has seen the light of the day. Even those that have seen the light of the day, they are coming in different forms and sizes that are not encouraging and not also friendly to our membership.\n\n\u201cToday what our members go through is mutilation of salaries, none payment of promises made such as that of the new minimum wage arrears, none implementation or partial or lopsided payment of the hazard and responsibility allowance, issues of staff schools that have become an issue of concern to all our membership.\n\n\u201cFunding of state universities has become so terrible, some universities in Nigeria of state extraction suffer 12 months or two, three years of none payment of salaries and allowances.

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nThis lengthy time frame jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about a year and a half, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. The same year he exited his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\n\n\nChari warehouses\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\n\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy me out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for me,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Oxfordbuildbay wants you to easily own land, no matter how much you earn",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was with great joy in her heart that she put pen to paper and signed the document, officially making her a landowner in Lagos State, Nigeria. It\u2019s been a lifelong dream of hers, and she couldn\u2019t believe it was actually unfolding before her eyes. She looked at her son, Stephen, who smiled back, beaming with pride.\n\nUnfortunately, this joy would be short-lived. Sadly, Mrs Nwachukwu fell victim to the product of years of anarchy and regulatory laxity and lost the land she bought with her hard-earned money. This experience left a bad taste with Stephen, and he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he needed to find a solution and immediately contacted his friend, Olamilekan.\n\nThis experience was not unique to Olamilekan Adeniji and Stephen Nwachuckwu, Co-founders of Oxfordbuildbay, a real estate tech startup working to solve problems they\u2019ve experienced first hand.\n\n\u201cWe found that there\u2019s a constant issue around omo onile (traditional landowners), there\u2019s the issue around finding out who actually owns the land. God help you, you might not even get it, or they take you to somewhere farther than you had bargained for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter this experience, we began thinking of ways to use technology to make land ownership more seamless, and affordable for the average Nigerian,\u201d says Nwachukwu\n\nThe entry barrier to real estate in Nigeria is significantly high for speculative investors and those who simply want their own homes. A 2019 survey of 5,000 Nigerians showed that 62 \u2013 63% of owned land comes by family inheritance, and just 18% bought theirs outrightly.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing deficit is more pronounced in urban areas than rural areas. Due to the high living costs, lands in places like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt are prohibitively expensive.\n\nHomeownership stands at 73% in rural areas, compared to 35% in urban areas. Increasing urban migration and continued pressure on infrastructure is worsening Nigeria\u2019s property ownership situation.\n\nIf you check these listings on Jiji, for example, you\u2019ll find a plot of land in Lekki, Lagos, going for \u20a612 billion ($29 million). More than enough money to bankroll the Series A rounds for Paystack and Flutterwave. But you\u2019ll also see a listing as low as \u20a6140,000 in a less developed part of Lagos.\n\nRegardless of what you opt for, you\u2019d still have to deal with uncertainties and the disturbances of omo oniles, who people have come to regard as louts.\n\nSo far, regulatory attention has not featured as effectively as it should in Nigeria\u2019s property space, but Adeniji and Nwachukwu were not about to wait for the government to set things right.\n\nToday, the company they built offers people the chance to pay for lands with as little as \u20a6250 daily for two years, after which it becomes fully theirs. But the journey was a tough one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBraving stormy waters\n\nComing from a background in finance, Nwachukwu sought out Adeniji, who had entrepreneurial experience, to seek a solution for people with similar stories to his mum\u2019s. Nwachukwu recounts that he attended Techpoint Inspired 2019, and he and his partner were inspired to build a product that would solve Nigeria\u2019s housing problems. They called it Buildbay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounders of Oxfordbuildbay: Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth (left), Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 MD (right). Source: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the failure of regulations, but we felt there was something we could do to solve the problem. First, we thought we could excuse the omo oniles, so you could trust that the land you buy from the comfort of your home is actually genuine and is verifiable,\u201d Nwachukwu says.\n\nAdeniji points out that it would be very difficult to verify if the omo onile selling a property to you is the actual owner of that land.\n\n\u201cMaybe someone leads you to another person, who then takes you to another family who owns the land. There are always long chains like these,\u201d he reveals.\u201cWhen a company approaches the government to get land, or they approach these same omo oniles, it\u2019s usually a different ball game than when an individual approaches them.\n\nAdeniji opines that the idea was to create a safety net for individuals who do not have the financial might or connection to fend off bullies and poachers from their properties.\n\nFor this to happen, the two founders had to acquire large amounts of land and sort out issues with the omo oniles themselves. If you\u2019ve followed my analysis this far, you can surmise that this would cost a ton of money.\n\nWith no venture capital funding, Buildbay got in talks with Oxford International Group, a multisectoral business empire, that bought into the founders\u2019 vision and absorbed Buildbay to birth the company, Oxfordbuildbay.\n\nWith the platform fully launched, the company had to find ways to onboard users who would appreciate the solution it came up with.\n\n\u201cWe had to leverage the real estate agent network who penetrated deep into the market and pretty much helped onboard people on the platform we built. These guys would go into markets, schools, and several other places. We also had to employ cooperatives because they had a large number of people who would need the products we were offering,\u201d Adeniji explains.\n\nWith the resounding success of this aggressive offline marketing, the company could automate the whole process and limit human interaction as much as possible. Customers could now take their pick of land across Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo and pay with their cards or connect their accounts, so they are automatically debited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nAnother major issue the startup had to tackle was the reputation of hidden charges among real estate developers. To do this, it took up the task of educating people.\n\nLike most founders, getting the right talent became paramount, and they actively sought people who would buy into the company\u2019s vision.\n\nIt looked for talent in industries similar to theirs but also took bets on teachable people who displayed a willingness to learn.\n\n\u201cSometimes we found that the people we hired had bought the product before, so selling our vision to them was a no-brainer,\u201d Adeniji states excitedly.\n\nThis strategy, Adeniji opines, has helped Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s mission so far.\n\nHow Oxfordbuildbay works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxfordbuildbay has optimised its entire process to work for the different kinds of visitors to its website.\n\n\u201cWhen less tech-savvy users head to the website, www.oxfordbuildbay.com, there\u2019s a WhatsApp popup that is so in your face. When you click it, it links you to a support agent who then walks you through the whole process from start to finish,\u201d Nwachukwu explains.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, you could simply create an account, log in to your dashboard, click on the land locations, which will bring out the different land locations we have as of today, and then click on buy. It takes you to the cart, and you also get to choose your payment frequency before you pay.\n\nTypically, getting lands from real estate developers usually comes with other hidden or inexplicable charges, but Nwachukwu insists that there\u2019s nothing of the sort with Oxfordbuildbay.\n\n\u201cAll of these with zero allocation fee, zero agency fee, zero documentation fee and allocation can be between the 6th and 12th months while the payment is ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put that in perspective, we\u2019ve helped Nigerians save over N2.3 billion on agency, legal and \u2018omo onile\u2019 fees when acquiring a land,\u201d claims Nwachukwu.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve made the payment, you get an offer letter which gives the purchase details \u2014 the size of land you bought, the location you picked, what you have paid, and what is left to pay.\u201d\n\nOxfrordbuildbay measures its lands in small units called \u201cSlots\u201d, which is half a plot. Its plots are usually 300 square metres on Lagos Mainland and everywhere else, and 250 square metres on the Island.\n\nThere are regularly scheduled site inspection visits at different intervals, and any customer can request an inspection for a small fee.\n\nThe startup recently launched its Android app, and its IoS app, creating a fresh avenue for users to access the platform, and begin their land ownership.\n\nBusiness model and expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Akinyinka Akinpelu \u2013 Head of Business, Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth, Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 Managing Director and CEO, Oxfordbuildbay. Source: Supplied.\n\nWithout sharing any specific figures, Nwachukwu insists that Oxfordbuilbay\u2019s entire process ensures that the company is profitable.\n\nHe argues that the company\u2019s business model allows it to capture people from different rungs of the social ladder, and it\u2019s helping to create constant cash flow and make the business sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are upstream financially who are interested in the trust and certainty we offer, as well as people who are looking for affordable and flexible options to own a property.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu likens this strategy to the sachet milk strategy. He states that the company has already acquired huge expanses of land over time, these lands have appreciated, and it made perfect business sense to sell them in little affordable bits.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, it all adds up,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cour mission to democratise homeownership is quite different from any other player out there.\u201d\n\nIt has also put systems in place to deter people from defaulting on payments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say life happens, we wait for 1, 2, and 3 months and there\u2019s still no payment, we adjust the pricing for the land, so you start paying for the land at a reviewed price that factors in land appreciation. Customers who do not default continue to pay for the land at the price it was when they started paying.\u201d\n\nSeveral other factors could lead people to default on payments in a country like Nigeria, and Oxfordbuildbay has a little fail-safe.\n\n\u201cKnowing that health can be a major deterrent when making long term payments like this, we have partnered with an HMO to offer free health insurance to customers who consistently pay for three months.\u201d\n\nWhile this might seem quite generous, the company has an end goal in mind. As Nwachukwu pointed out earlier, the margins actually make sense at the end.\n\n\u201cLike any business, we obviously want to make a profit. But our primary goal is to democratise homeownership and become the brand that Africans come to for their homeownership needs.\u201d\n\nSo far, Nwachukwu reveals that the company has been bootstrapping, but it is looking for funding to expand its offerings which are fast gaining traction across West Africa.\n\nOxfordbuildbay has 20,000 consistent customers, and it has visions of expanding across Nigeria and to other African countries.\n\nNigeria\u2019s property sector has been filled with exciting innovations in recent years, but Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s value proposition is quite compelling, and it creates room for excitement and possibly other similar down-to-earth solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

However, in 2021, it was ranked 163rd out of 191.\n\nWhile this indicates a slow improvement in the country\u2019s health system, only over 10 million out of a growing population of 200 million Nigerians are currently covered by health insurance. This is done through various programmes by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), state health insurance agencies, and private plans run by Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Despite the fact that some Nigerians are more health conscious \u2014 particularly as a result of technological advancement \u2014 over 170 million people do not have a health insurance plan.\n\nDespite the various insurance companies available, due to poverty and ignorance, few Nigerians have insurance coverage for their homes, cars, lives, and other aspects of their lives.\n\nInsurpass, an API solution insurtech startup, wants to assist Nigerians in getting insurance.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole spoke with the co-founders, who explained how the company plans to increase insurance adoption in the country.\n\nPlease, read it here: With its API infrastructure and agent network, Insurpass wants to increase insurance adoption in Nigeria\n\nInstagram\u2019s Remix for public content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram announced yesterday, Thursday, January 20, 2022, that users will be able to remix any public video content on the app, not just short-form reel videos.\n\nWhat exactly does this indicate? Any public video on Instagram is fair game for a remix. Also, it only applies to videos that were made public as of yesterday and not to content created prior to the day it was announced.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this launch? The company stated that the expansion made sense after seeing how well Remix has been received by Reels users. It wanted to provide more opportunities for creators to \u201creinvent their content\u201d and collaborate with others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen remixing a non-Reels video, creators will still have access to Reels\u2019 set of creative tools, such as Collabs, Voiceover, Effects, and Audio Tools.\n\nHow can you use this feature? Users can access the new feature by tapping the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of any public Instagram video published after the update goes live. Then, select \u201cRemix this video\u201d and record your response or upload a video from your phone\u2019s camera roll.\n\nCreator\u2019s can remix all or a portion of another person\u2019s video and download it as part of the remix. The final remixed video will be visible wherever you share your reels.\n\nIs this something you\u2019ve seen before? Yes, it\u2019s similar to YouTube Shorts which allows creators to sample audio from other people\u2019s videos for use on their own.\n\nChari\u2019s bridge round at $100 million valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nChari, a Moroccan B2B e-commerce and retail startup, has raised a bridge round at a $100 million valuation.\n\nThe round saw participation from Khwarizmi Ventures, Air Angels, Y Combinator, Rocket Internet, Global Founders Capital, Plug n Play, Orange Ventures, Harvard University Management Company, Village Capital and P1 Ventures, and Afri Mobility \u2014 the venture capital arm of the AKWA Group.\n\nFounded by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (co-founder) in 2020, Chari is a mobile app that enables small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from FMCG multinationals and local manufacturers, receiving them in less than 24 hours.\n\nInterestingly, a Moroccan ledger book, Karny.ma, was acquired by the company in 2021. The platform offers credit and bookkeeping services to approximately 50,000 merchants. It enables these merchants to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nThe acquisition of Karny and the bridge round are part of Chari\u2019s strategy to provide payment facilities. The company claims the strategy puts them in a good position to offer financial services to their retailers, particularly buy now, pay later (BNPL)\n\nAccording to the CEO, the company plans to test the BNPL services with its existing customers using the funds from the bridge round.\n\nMore so, if the results are positive, Chari will acquire a local credit company to allow shop owners to lend money to their end-users and grow their business. It also plans to expand this BNPL service to Tunisia and other French-speaking countries in Africa.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat it really means to live your best life.

          "text": "Nigeria is missing on the list of African countries that have been selected in a landmark deal to produce low-cost versions of molnupiravir, an oral COVID-19 antiviral medicine produced by Merck & Co.\n\nMedicines Patent Pool (MPP) had negotiated a deal with Merck last year to give sublicense to generic drug manufacturers to produce raw ingredients for molnupiravir and the finished drug itself.\n\nOn Thursday MPP announced that it has signed agreements with 27 generic manufacturing companies from India, China and other countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East after they successfully met MPP\u2019s requirements\n\nKenya, South Africa and Egypt are the lists of countries in Africa that will start producing these COVID-19 pills after demonstrating their capability in terms of production capacity, regulatory compliance, and the ability to meet international standards for quality-assured medicines.\n\nBut, Nigeria\u2019s failure to revamp or scale up the country\u2019s capacity for drug manufacturing at par with global standards is excluding it. Operations of existing drug manufacturing plants hardly conform to global standards for general manufacturing practice (GMP), a deficit analyst say inhibits the potential to attract top manufacturing deals.\n\nHealth experts have repeatedly knocked the government for consistently choosing to rely on developed nations rather than build local capacity, even despite the lessons learnt from the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRead also: COVID-19 and the global problem of Chinese-style actionism\n\nThis deal backed by the United Nations (UN) five companies will focus on producing the raw ingredients. While 13 companies will produce both raw ingredients, nine will produce the finished drug. The companies span 11 countries, including Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, and Vietnam.\n\nThe deal stipulated the pill would be distributed to 105 low and middle-income countries. An MPP spokesperson said deliveries from some firms covered by the deal could start as early as February.\n\nMerck\u2019s green light to production of its anti-viral pill molnupiravir by other companies during the pandemic has been described as a rare example in the pharmaceutical sector, which usually protects its patented treatments for longer periods.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the large number of new and existing partners that have moved quickly to secure a sublicense for molnupiravir through MPP,\u201d Charles Gore, MPP executive director said.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical step toward ensuring global access to an urgently needed COVID-19 treatment and we are confident that, as manufacturers are working closely with regulatory authorities, the anticipated treatments will be rapidly available in Low and Middle-Income Countries.\u201d\n\nPaul Schaper, executive director, Global Public Policy, MSD (a trading name of Merck & Co), said, \u201cAccelerating broad, affordable access to molnupiravir has been a priority for MSD from the start, which led us to partner with MPP on a licensing agreement to expand access to quality-assured generic versions of molnupiravir, subject to local regulatory authorisation. We are pleased to see this vision come to life, with strong geographic diversity in MPP\u2019s selected generic manufacturing sublicensees.\u201d\n\nStudies show that molnupiravir reduces the risk of hospitalisation or death from COVID-19. In December 2021, MSD received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization for molnupiravir to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults with positive results of direct COVID-19 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19.\n\nMolnupiravir was invented at Emory University and licensed to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics by Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to advance the development of early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern.\n\nEmory received research funding from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s over 100 million internet subscribers may not fit into the about 70 cinemas across the country or even be able to afford the average N1,243 movie ticket the cinema operators demand, but they do not have to miss the fun with the many streaming services now in existence.\n\nThere is, however, a bigger incentive pushing producers and investors in Nollywood toward streaming services \u2013 the promise of a global audience. Recent movies such as King of Boys: Return of the King, produced by Kemi Adetiba have ridden that wave to success. In 2021, the seven-episode series ranked seventh in the world on Netflix\u2019s global viewership board (a streaming platform).\n\nNevertheless, experts say there is a difference between popularity for a movie and becoming the most-grossing movie like Omo Ghetto: The Saga in 2021. The debate is that should the Funke Akindele comedy movie had ended up only on Netflix without making the rounds in cinema halls, it may never have raked in N640 million it recorded at the Box Office.\n\nSadly, Netflix does not release data on movie earnings; hence, one may never know just how much was realised from streaming the movie on that platform.\n\nAs alluring as the revenues from cinemas may be, they have a serious limitation in supply and capacity.\n\nAccording to a UNESCO report in late 2021, the number of cinema screens in Africa is at 1,653, which is one screen per 781,402 in population coverage, compared to the United States which has a total of 44,111 cinemas, which is 7,503 per screen.\n\nNigeria, the largest country in Africa, and Lagos being the home of the second biggest movie industry in the world, can only boast 237 screens as of November 2021. This amounts to population coverage of one screen per 843,881 people.\n\nWhile revenues from cinemas may be bigger than streaming at the moment they are only just recovering from a pandemic hit, going by data released by the Cinema Exhibitors Association of Nigeria (CEAN). The data found that the total weekend movie ticket sales rose by 100 percent to N2.4 billion ($5.4m) in 2021 from N1.2 billion in 2020. The figure however is a decline from the record in 2019 at N4.1 billion ($9.9m).\n\nOn the other hand, South Africa, the second-largest economy after Nigeria, has about 120 cinemas and was able to generate $18.8 million (N7.7bn) in weekly sales in 2021.\n\nFactors that affect cinema revenues and ticket sales are not far-fetched, according to experts. They include multiple taxations, low-income levels, inflationary forces, foreign exchange in terms of equipment import, quality content, among others.\n\nThese limitations have played a role in the popularity of streaming services. The emergence of streaming platforms such as Iroko TV, YouTube, Netflix, Showmax, Amazon Prime, Ndani TV, etc, is considered as the new era of movie production.\n\n\u201cNetflix is like one of the major investments that have actually put the industry out there. People from outside the continent of Africa can now watch content, view our stories, relate to how we tell our stories. It has also paved the way because filmmakers can now go directly to the audience in terms of telling stories,\u201d said Damilola Aleje, a creative producer in Nollywood.\n\nNetflix and Amazon Prime did not just thrust the industry into the global stage, they also have helped set the gold standard for movie making in Nigeria. Prior to their coming, hurriedly made movies proliferated the market and were marketed and distributed by traders in Alaba Market, Aba, and Upper Iweka in Anambra. But the streaming services have made quality production a must-have and now control how the distribution of the movies is run. Importantly, they brought competition to the market.\n\nRead also: Nigerian cinemas shed pandemic blues earn N2.4bn in 2021 ticket sales\n\n\u201cI think each platform is going to play their game and it\u2019s also going to get as much revenue as they are going to get. Streaming platforms are coming in hard. The competition is becoming stiffer. 2022 is streaming wars. It\u2019s not just one major player anymore. The players are now going to be distributed into different angles,\u201d Aleje said.\n\nNotwithstanding, old hands like Kunle Afolayan, the producer of hit movies like Citation, October 1, A Naija Christmas, and many others, believe the best revenue model for Nollywood is one in which streaming and cinema exist side-by-side irrespective of their differences.\n\nStreaming services face significant limitations in Nigeria, especially in the availability of internet infrastructure, the rising cost of living, and uncertainty in regulatory policies. Broadband penetration currently stands at 39.9 percent and streaming relies heavily on mobile broadband.\n\nThis means that the speed for videos is very low and quality may vary depending on the network service a user is using. For example, in areas where 4G is scarce, users may not be able to enjoy the streaming services. It would require huge investments in fiber-optic cable deployment to get the services across the entire country. It is estimated that Nigeria requires about 120,000km of fiber cables to achieve full internet service, as the country has a deficit of 80,000km.\n\nIn the absence of streaming services in major parts of the country, cinemas can fill the gap for movie lovers through community cinemas.",

Vincent Aizebeoje Balogun have called on the Federal Government to create a favourable environment for the green manufacturing technology sector to thrive.\n\nAnd to develop the green manufacturing technology through the use of its local content technology for the production of goods in the manufacturing sector.\n\nEngr. Prof. Balogun, made the call while delivering his paper titiled Green Manufacturing: A Novel Approach to Economic Recovery in Nigeria, at the 3rd Inaugural lecture series of the Edo State University Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government, Edo State.\n\nThe Don said Nigeria should capitalized on her population of over 200 million people in order to explore, penetrate and create strong market for its manufacturing sector.\n\nBalogun a Professor in the Deparment of Mechanical Engeering, Edo State University Uzairue said the solution to economic poverty in the country is technological revolution and self sufficiently in the production of green consumer goods which can only be avhieved through green manufacturing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe way forward is for Nigeria to take advantage of the green manufacturing strategy and evolve her manufacturing sector in that direction as we move toward s the 4th industrial revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of manufacturing machining in our nation to be specific needs a step change to enhance sustainability and transformation towards green,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe, as a nation, cannot continue to depend on imported technology and food, and expect to be classified as a developed nation.\n\n\u201cRather, we need to employ and develop our green manufacturing sector so that we can create more jobs and take our citizens out of the streets\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Balogun noted that the manufacturing sector provides the greatest opportunity for the transformation of the Nigerian economy, saying that it is an antidote for unemployment, a creator of wealth and threshold for sustainable development.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough manufacturing in Nigeria has a few challenges; among them are inadequate and epileptic power supply, regulatory issues, multiplicities of taxes, trade facilitation issues and infrastructural deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThere are some area of strengths that Nigeria could build on if she considers the new trend of green manufacturing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further described green manufacturing as a products through economically-sound processes that minimise negative environmental impact while conserving energy and natural resources.\n\n\u201cGreen manufacturing is a gateway and key to competitive economy. The competitiveness of manufacturing and support for sustainable development demand new aporoaches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an urgret call at all levels of manufacturing to curtail the emission rate as proposed by United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to meet the sustsinable agenda in order to help cushion the impact of electrical energy consumption on the environment during manufacturing processes\u201d he said.\n\nThe Don said that green manufacturing technology are increasingly becoming more attractive globally for the production of consumer products, adding that it minimises and eliminates processing and production waste using eco-efficient practices and new environmental technology at all levels of manufacturing activities.\n\nHe said Nigerian manufacturing sector contributes 4.19 per cent to the national GDP, saying that for Nigeria to be one of the 20 biggest economies in the world in 2020, the sector must be contributing a minimum of 15 per cent yearly to its GDP and grow it steadily to a minimum of 30 per cent by 2021.\n\nHe urged manufacturers operating in the country to key into the green manufacturing technology for the manufacturing of their products.\n\n\u201cGreen manufacturing is a national call to the development of environmentally friendly manufacturing factor, concepts, methods and tools that are important in design and manufacturing of discrete products in order to minimise the life cycle cost due to environmental demage.\n\n\u201cFor green manufacturing to thrive, there has to be an understanding and advocacy on the modus operandi towards green mechanical machining processes.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore compelling on all manufacturers including Nigerian manufacturers to engage in discussion that boils around the reduction of CO2 levels through the minimum consumption of fossil fuels and other parameters to encourage green manufsctures of products,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

Our state commission will collaborate with the Federal Commission so that we do not occupy that false place in this area.\n\n\u201cWe would like to occupy the first in many areas, but not in fraud and Yahoo Yahoo.\n\nSpeaking on kidnapping along the Ogun-Oyo corridors, Abiodun revealed that he had spoken with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to \u201cjointly collaborate in the area of providing security at the border posts\u201d between the two states.\n\nHe added that Makinde had concluded plans to be in Ogun with his team of law enforcement architecture, for a plan on how to fish out the hoodlums.",

          "title": "2023: How Tinubu\u2019s declaration, Osinbajo\u2019s ambition unsettle South-west, APC",
          "text": "\u2026Why the zone unsettled \u2013 Odua Youth Forum \u2026Osinbajo better prepared for Presidency \u2013 Support groups \u2026VP shouldn\u2019t run against his benefactor \u2013 TSG \u2018\u2026They\u2019ll work together, no ambition can separate them\u2019\n\nAs the race for the 2023 presidential election gathers momentum, many politicians of note within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have declared their intentions to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE in this report examines how former Lagos state governor Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s declaration and Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s ambition have unsettled the South-west and the ruling party.\n\nSince Nigeria got her independence in 1960 till date, the South-west geopolitical zone has spent 11 years and three months in the Presidential Villa calling the shots, either as president or Head of State.\n\nThe first among them was Olusegun Obasanjo, who served as Head of State between February 1976 and October 1979; then Chief Ernest Adekunle Oladrinde Shonekan (of blessed memory) held sway briefly as Head of State and Chairman of the defunct Interim National Government (ING) between August 1993 and November 1993.\n\nNotably, the late Shonekan handed over to a democratically elected president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who governed from May 1999 to May 2007. So, the South- west has had two of its illustrious sons leading the country.\n\nAs the country approaches the 2023 general elections, the agitation is so high within the ruling APC that the presidential slot has been \u2018zoned\u2019 to the South, because the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari who by 2023 would have spent the constitutional eight years hails from the North. Though the APC is yet to zone its ticket, the few that have declared their intentions so far are from the South.\n\nFrom the South-west, only a former governor of Lagos state and national leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu, has declared his intention to run for president, as Nigerians from all works of life beacon on the vice-president, Prof. Osinbajo who is reportedly nurturing the idea to also declare for the exotic office. This has again left the West in a wild situation and the ruling party in a dilemma.\n\nTinubu\u2019s declaration\n\nAfter months of speculation, the national leader of the APC, the Jagaban Borgu and two-term governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Tinubu formally declared his intention to run for the country\u2019s president in 2023 in a \u201csymbolic\u201d move inside the Presidential Villa.\n\nThe Jagaban, who would be 70 years old by 2023, during his declaration in the State House, said, \u201cI\u2019ve informed the president of my intention, but I have not informed Nigerians yet. I\u2019m still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people I will consult.\n\n\u201cYou will soon hear. All you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You\u2019ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr. President of my ambition and you don\u2019t expect more answers than that.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what the president\u2019s response was, the APC chieftain said Buhari didn\u2019t ask him not to run.\n\n\u201cThat is our business. He is a democrat. He didn\u2019t ask me to stop. He didn\u2019t ask me not to attempt to pursue my ambition; it\u2019s a lifelong ambition. So, why do I expect him to say more than that? You are running a democratic dispensation and you must adopt the principles and the values and virtues of democracy. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nTinubu was also asked about his impression of a race for the APC ticket featuring him, Osinbajo and others. The question became imperative because he is the godfather to the former Lagos state attorney-general who he single-handedly nominated for vice-president. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself. I have the confidence, the vision, and the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President and turn Nigeria better. I\u2019ve done that with commitment and unyielding\u2026you know, in Lagos state. You have seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s ambition\n\nFor months and even after Tinubu\u2019s declaration those drumming support for the vice-president for the APC ticket have become more vociferous. Many times, many support groups have called on the vice-president to also throw his hat into the ring, many times the professor of law refuted media reports about his ambition. However, a few political observers and even APC stalwarts still believe that the vice-president will seek the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nA former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan and a social media influencer, Reno Omokri, thinks the vice-president\u2019s body language suggests that he will contest against Tinubu. Omokri on his confirmed Instagram page said it is obvious the vice-president wants to succeed the incumbent, President Muhammadu Buhari, \u201cwith the way he is packaging himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the way and manner Vice President Osinbajo is packaging himself, carefully releasing scripted subliminal messages, and also leaking staged \u2018un-staged\u2019 photos that show he is fit and not sickly, while also attempting to distance himself from Buhari\u2019s policies, one thing is crystal clear: Tinubu needs to be very careful.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo is playing what the Yoruba call boju-boju (hide and seek). Someone tells you he does not like going to the farm, meanwhile, you see him arranging hoes, cutlasses, and gathering seeds. In any case, the lgbo man says dem no dey tell blind man say market done close.\n\nBlueprint Weekend also gathered that many organisations are mobilising and have even invited the vice-president to Kano for a formal declaration even some others believe Tinubu\u2019s declaration remains the greatest setback for Osinbajo\u2019s ambition.\n\nUnsettled zone\n\nA political analyst and member of the Odua Youth Forum, Wasiu Saka, notes that the zone is unsettled now because of the kinds of personal and political history Tinubu and Osinbajo share in common.\n\nHe said, \u201cSince leaving office as governor in 2007, Tinubu has functioned as a political strategist and leader of the progressives who played a significant role in the 2015 general elections to ensure that the PDP was defeated by the APC.\n\n\u201cTinubu is highly experienced, with a huge political war chest that includes money and a network of politicians who have benefited from his political dynasty; a godfather and one who wants to determine who should be what in the political sphere. So, for a man who has dominated discourses in the Nigerian political sphere for over two decades, certainly, the political sphere will.\n\n\u201cAlso disturbing is the fact that Tinubu single handedly nominated Osinbajo for the position of vice-president; so, contesting against his benefactor will certainly unsettle a zone that wants to produce the next president. Politicians and concerned individuals from the South-west are disturbed because if they both contest for the APC ticket it will affect the zone\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cThis is the same feeling within the APC in the South-west; party faithful are concerned about the party\u2019s success. A few believe that if Tinubu and Osinbajo work together the party stand a better chance, but if they work separately it may spell doom for the party.\n\n\u201cSo, some are unsettled because if they both work in unison, it may make the zone and APC win, while others are also concerned because the contest may create a crack in their campand, therefore, affects the zone and party\u2019s chances.\u201d\n\nSupport groups\u2019 declarations\n\nA group mobilising support for the actualisation of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s presidential ambition on the platform of Organised Private Sector for Osinbajo (OPS 4 Osinbajo) has declared that their principal was more prepared than any other aspirant.\n\nThe group added that the task of leading \u201cNigeria\u2019s economic rejuvenation towards future greatness requires an intellectual like the VP Osinbajo.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), the umbrella body of all the support groups, said no declaration by any number of aspirants \u201ccan douse the patriotic passion associated with those championing the cause of an Osinbajo presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Alhaji Abdulrahman Farouk, said, \u201cWith Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s organised private sector has a very good basis for optimism about post-2023 economic activities.\n\n\u201cEven though an aspirant has informed Muhammadu Buhari about his 2023 ambition, the most credible option still appears to be Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and for the organised private sector as well as the citizenry, Osinbajo offers a more fertile ground for hope to rapidly germinate.\n\n\u201cGetting Nigeria\u2019s economy to grow faster than the population is going to take a lot of consistent planning, discipline and integrity, as well as great consistency in implementation, and with his sharp focus, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is expected to do well.\u201d\n\nAccording to Farouk, \u201cThe idealistic and very patriotic pursuit of various economic policies led by Osinbajo speak volumes about future potentials for people-focused policies; under his supervision, Nigeria\u2019s social investment programmes have been ranked internationally but much more good news should unfold when he is fully in the saddle by 2023.\u201d\n\nTSG\u2019s take\n\nAlso, the Tinubu Support Groups (TSG) reminded Osinbajo not to forget that he has been a core member of the Tinubu political family all his life, urging him not to contest against his benefactor.\n\nThe FCT campaign chairman of TSG, a former member of the House of Representatives in the territory, Zaphaniah Jisalo, who spoke on behalf of the group recently, warned supporters of both political leaders not to create tension in their camps, saying Osinbajo\u2019s rumoured ambition will be sorted out within the political family.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe issue in question is such that no one can answer it. But I know and believe that Osinbajo knows what he is doing. I believe he knows who his mentor is, and whatever anybody is thinking or hearing or trying to ask Osinbajo to contest against his mentor, I don\u2019t think it is realistic. So, we will wait and see it. And we also have responsibility to make sure that such a thing does not happen.\n\n\u201cYou know the contest is open and we are not afraid of whoever is going to contest against Asiwaju, but as an experienced politician I will say here that respect is key.\u201d Jisalo, however, thanked the former Lagos state governor for heeding their calls to run for president in 2023.\n\nAlso speaking, the FCT secretary of TSG, Patrick Oduyemi, said, \u201cYou see, Professor Osinbajo is a part of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu family and I can assure you that it is a family matter which will be sorted out at the family level. So, I don\u2019t want anybody to dabble into it such that they will create the sort of tension between Tinubu and the vice-president. So, let us leave it as it is because it will be sorted out at the appointed time.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s view\n\nA political analyst, who is the chief executive officer of Societal Safety Network (SSN), Abdulrahman Agboola, in his view, said Tinubu and Osinbajo will work together in 2023 for the APC, noting that no ambition can separate the two.\n\nAgboola, who spoke in an exclusive interview with Blueprint Weekend, explained that, \u201cWe have a major block in the South-west and that major block is the progressives. And the progressives from time immemorial are around the people that follow the teachings of Pa Awolowo. The only people remaining now are Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chief Bisi Akande and Chief Ayo Adebanjo.\n\n\u201cCome to think of it, as far as progressive politics is concerned in the South-west and Nigeria since 1999, and also since the death of Chief Bola Ige, it is Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu that has taken the progressives politics as a personal identity.\u201d\n\nAgboola noted further that, \u201cSo, the relationship between Asiwaju Tinubu and Osinbajo is not what any one should dabble into. The reality is that both of them will not run at the same time on the platform of the APC. They won\u2019t even contest against each other at the primary; that is how I am looking at it. This is because those who are privileged to know the kind of relationship between the two of them know that it is deeper and such no political ambition can separate them.\n\n\u201cSo, as far as these two are concerned, if Osinbajo declares it will be good for Asiwaju\u2019s ambition. Recall that it was Asiwaju that nominated Osinbajo to become the vice-president; so you think a political ambition will divide them now? It\u2019s not possible. No matter what, in the long run both of them will work together.\u201d",

So far 500 houses have been affected. Some have been razed down completely by the explosion while others have developed cracks,\u201d Sedzi Sadzi Amedonu, Deputy Coordinator of the National Disaster Management Organization, told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a ghost town now.\u201d\n\nAbena Mintah, who witnessed the blast, told local media the driver of the truck dropped down from his hatch, shouting at those nearby to warn them away from the flaming vehicle.\n\n\u201cWithin a few minutes we heard a loud bang. I felt dizzy and fell in the bush. I managed to get up and saw a few dismembered bodies on the street,\u201d Mintah said.\n\nThe government said those in critical condition would be moved to hospitals in Accra and police asked surrounding villages to open their schools and churches to accommodate any additional casualties.\n\nA team of police and army explosion experts were deployed to \u201cavoid a second explosion\u201d and put in place security measures after the blast, the government said in a press release.\n\n\u2018Community Gone\u2019\n\nEmergency services were to give a casualty update on Friday at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).\n\nDr Isaac Dasmani, chief executive of the Prestea Huni-Valley municipality where the explosion occurred, told local media \u201cthe whole community is gone\u201d after the blast.\n\n\u201cAll of the roofs have been ripped off, some of the buildings have collapsed. Some were in their rooms, and were trapped. Some of them unfortunately, before we were able to rescue them, were already gone,\u201d he told Ghana\u2019s TV3 broadcaster.\n\nAuthorities have created an access route to the scene and were working to open roads on Friday to ease traffic around the blast site, he said.\n\nGhana has been rocked by several deadly explosions caused by fuel accidents in recent years.\n\nIn 2017, at least three people were killed and dozens injured after a tanker truck carrying natural gas caught fire in Accra, triggering explosions at two fuel stations and killing three people.\n\nGhana\u2019s capital was the scene of a similar fire and explosion in June 2015, when more than 150 people died as they sought shelter from seasonal rains and flooding at a petrol station. The blaze was believed to have spread by fuel on the floodwater.\n\nDeadly accidents linked to the mining sector are also frequent in Ghana, Africa\u2019s second largest gold producer after South Africa, but they are mostly caused by the collapse of mines, often illegal ones.\n\nIn June, at least nine people died in the collapse of an illegal mine in northern Ghana.\n\nAFP",

Yemen also suffered a country-wide internet blackout.\n\nREAD ALSO: 14 Dead As Coalition Bombs Yemen After UAE Attack\n\n\u201cThe children were reportedly playing on a nearby football field when missiles struck,\u201d Save the Children said.\n\nEight aid agencies operating in Yemen said in a joint statement they were \u201chorrified by the news that more than 70 people, including migrants, women and children, have been killed\u2026 in a blatant disregard for civilian lives\u201d.\n\nThey said the prison in Saada was used as a holding centre for migrants, who made up many of the casualties.\n\n\u2018Proportionate response\u2019\n\nBut the United Arab Emirates insisted that it and other coalition members remained committed to \u201cproportionate\u201d responses to Huthi attacks.\n\n\u201cThe coalition undertakes to abide by international law and proportionate response in all its military operations,\u201d UAE ambassador to the United Nations Lana Nusseibeh said.\n\nThe strikes came after the Huthis took the seven-year war into a new phase by claiming a drone and missile attack on Abu Dhabi that killed three people on Monday.\n\nThey came as the UN Security Council met to discuss that attack at the UAE\u2019s request.\n\nThe council unanimously condemned the \u201cheinous terrorist attacks\u201d by the Yemeni rebels, but in a statement before the meeting the council\u2019s Norwegian presidency also strongly condemned the latest violence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d Norwegian ambassador Mona Juul said of the strikes, calling for \u201cde-escalation and restraint\u201d.\n\nIn a later statement, the UN said Guterres \u201creminds all parties that attacks directed against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited by international humanitarian law.\u201d\n\nAid workers said hospitals in Saada were overwhelmed after the prison attack, with one receiving 70 dead and 138 wounded, according to Doctors Without Borders.\n\nTwo other hospitals have received \u201cmany wounded\u201d and as night fell, the rubble was still being searched, the aid agency said.\n\n\u2018Horrific act\u2019\n\nAhmed Mahat, Doctors Without Borders\u2019 head of mission in Yemen, said: \u201cThere are many bodies still at the scene of the air strike, many missing people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to know how many people have been killed. It seems to have been a horrific act of violence.\u201d\n\nThe coalition claimed the attack in Hodeida, a lifeline port for the shattered country, but did not say it had carried out any strikes on Saada.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s state news agency said the coalition carried out \u201cprecision air strikes\u2026 to destroy the capabilities of the Huthi militia in Hodeida\u201d.\n\nIt said Saudi air defences destroyed a missile fired from Saada on Friday towards Khamis Mushait, site of a major Saudi air base.\n\nGlobal internet watchdog NetBlocks reported a \u201cnation-scale collapse of internet connectivity\u201d.\n\nAFP correspondents in Hodeida and Sanaa confirmed the outage. Save the Children said it would hamper its operating capacity.\n\nYemen\u2019s civil war began in 2014 when the Huthis descended from their base in Saada to overrun the capital Sanaa, prompting Saudi-led forces to intervene to prop up the government the following year.\n\nTensions have soared in recent weeks after the UAE-backed Giants Brigade drove the rebels out of Shabwa province, undermining their months-long campaign to take the key city of Marib further north.\n\nOn January 3, the Huthis hijacked a United Arab Emirates-flagged ship in the Red Sea, prompting a warning from the coalition that it would target rebel-held ports.\n\nAnd on Monday, they claimed a long-range attack that struck oil facilities and the airport in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, killing two Indians and a Pakistani, and wounding six other people.\n\nThe attack \u2014 the first deadly assault acknowledged by the UAE inside its borders and claimed by the Huthis \u2014 opened up a new front in Yemen\u2019s war and sent regional tensions soaring.\n\nIn retaliation, the coalition carried out air strikes against rebel-held Sanaa that killed 14 people.\n\nYemen\u2019s civil war has been a catastrophe for millions of its citizens who have fled their homes, with many close to famine in what the UN calls the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe UN has estimated the war killed 377,000 people by the end of 2021, both directly and indirectly through hunger and disease.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The United States is looking for ways to potentially accelerate delivery of Taiwan\u2019s next generation of new-build F-16 fighter jets, US officials said, bolstering the Taiwanese air force\u2019s ability to respond to what Washington and Taipei see as increasing intimidation by China\u2019s military.\n\nThe officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency that they have not yet come up with a solution on how to speed up delivery of Block 70 F-16s, manufactured by Lockheed Martin and equipped with new capabilities. The aircraft are currently slated to be delivered by the end of 2026.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s government has privately expressed its wish for a faster delivery to US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, a senior Taiwanese official said, as the self-ruled island\u2019s air force scrambles jets to intercept increasingly aggressive Chinese military flights.\n\nMore missions mean more wear-and-tear on Taiwan\u2019s aircraft.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about risk assessment \u2026 and it\u2019s clear where the risks are,\u201d the Taiwanese official said, referring to tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait separating the island from mainland China. The F-16 is considered a highly manoeuvrable aircraft proven in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack.\n\nTaiwan is on track to field one of the largest F-16 fleets in Asia once it takes delivery of 66 new-build F-16 C/D Block 70 aircraft under an $8bn deal approved in 2019. It would bring the island\u2019s total number of F-16s, including older versions, to more than 200 by 2026.\n\nThe Block 70 aircraft are the newest F-16 configuration, with new avionics, a modernised cockpit and an improved engine, according to Lockheed Martin.\n\nA move to accelerate the aircraft delivery would be seen in Beijing in part through a political lens, according to Abraham Denmark, a former senior Pentagon official.\n\n\u201cIt is yet another clear signal of US determination to support Taiwan\u2019s ability to defend itself,\u201d added Denmark, now an analyst at the Washington-based Wilson Center think-tank.\n\nDespite lacking formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the US is the island\u2019s main international backer and arms supplier. That defence relationship angers China, which has ramped up military and diplomatic pressure against the island that it claims as \u201csacred\u201d Chinese territory.\n\nIn the face of Chinese pressure, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has prioritised modernising the armed forces, which are well-armed but dwarfed by China\u2019s military.\n\nLockheed Martin declined to comment on any potential future requests to change the production schedule, referring queries to the US government and Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry.\n\nTaiwan-JetThe missions to intercept Chinese aircraft are putting stress on Taiwan\u2019s air force, which last year had several mishaps, including three fatal crashes [File: Tyrone Siu/Reuters]\n\nThe US State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, declined to comment on any internal discussions about potential changes to the delivery timeline.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s Air Force did not respond to questions on potential accelerated deliveries but told Reuters in a statement that the Taiwanese military\u2019s major weapon purchases are \u201crigorously planned in accordance with actual combat needs and planning schedules\u201d.\n\nThe US sale of F-16s to Taiwan was guided by US law and \u201cbased on an assessment of Taiwan\u2019s defence needs and the threat posed by (China), as has been the case for more than 40 years\u201d, a Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe missions to intercept Chinese aircraft are putting stress on Taiwan\u2019s air force, which last year had several mishaps, including three fatal crashes. Over time, fuel costs, pilot fatigue and wear and tear on Taiwanese aircraft will threaten the readiness of the island\u2019s air force if this pressure continues, Taiwanese and US military analysts said.\n\nLast March, a senior Taiwanese official said Taiwan\u2019s military had stopped intercepting every Chinese aircraft.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s air force last week suspended combat training for its entire F-16 fleet after a recently upgraded model of the fighter jet crashed into the sea in the latest of a series of accidents.\n\n\u201cThey (the Chinese) are wearing out their opponent without firing a shot,\u201d said Derek Grossman, a senior defence analyst at the RAND Corporation.\n\nIn 2020, Taiwan\u2019s air force scrambled jets at least 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft at a cost equivalent to US$905m.\n\nReuters",
