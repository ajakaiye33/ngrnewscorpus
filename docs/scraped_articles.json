The day aims to raise global awareness on the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion, as well as the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to national health systems.\n\nThe 2021 World Blood Donor Day is themed: Give blood and keep the world beating.\n\nCalling on Nigerians to come out and freely donate blood, the national coordinator revealed that out of about 500,000 blood units collected in Nigeria annually, only five percent are from voluntary donors.\n\nAmedu explained, \u201cCommercial blood donations constitute the largest portion of the country\u2019s blood source which is also the case of most low-income countries.\n\n\u201cCommercially donated blood is not very safe for transfusion at all. 10 percent of all blood transfused in Nigeria carry the risk of transmitting HIV, Hepatitis B, C and syphilis, according to a survey by the Federal Ministry of Health.\n\n\u201cAnd because blood transfusion is a known risk factor for the transmission of infectious disease including viral infections, it is important for us to be aware of the source of the blood we get.\n\n\u201cThe risk of blood transfusion is increased by blood procured from commercial donors who largely belong to high-risk groups because they undergo unsafe practices such homosexuals, those injecting drugs.\n\n\u201cAnd because we are not sure of the lifestyle of people that donate blood, we view commercial blood donation as very unsafe for transfusion.\u201d\n\nHe notes that increasing the voluntary blood donor base in Nigeria is critical to ensuring the availability and accessibility of safe blood in the country.\n\nResponding to questions from participants on the issue of the sale of blood, the national coordinator said that blood is not usually sold, but noted that money paid in the hospital for blood is for screening and not for the blood itself.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst, let me say here that blood is not sold at all. We need to process this blood to make it free from infectious diseases. For us to provide a unit of blood, it costs us between N35,000 to N40,000 to make one.\n\n\u201cSo, what we collect is an access fee of N6,000 to enable us to process this blood for use.\u201d\n\nHe urged the media to demystify the myth around blood donation so that people can come out and freely donate blood.\n\n\u201cLet there be an enabling environment for blood donation and transfusion especially in terms of infrastructure, equipment, reagents and consumables so that people can have access to cheap blood.\n\n\u201cThe more investment government makes in the blood services, the lesser the access fee for people to get safe blood.\n\n\u201cI want to commend PUNCH Media Foundation for this sensitisation because it will help Nigerians see the need why they should donate blood\u201d, he said.\n\nThe webinar also featured other speakers including, Lagos State Branch Secretary, Nigerian Red Cross Society, Olakunle Lasisi; Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the International Society of Media in Public Health, Moji Makanjuola; and Founder, Action on Blood, Abiola Okubanjo.\n\nIt also featured various presentations and poems on the importance of voluntary blood donation by students from Platform Schools, Graceland Schools trand Dobar Comprehensive College.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Our nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geo-political zones with banditry, militancy, and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme.\n\n\u201cThe worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-East. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity. I, therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new Chief of Army Staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that Nigeria deserves a re-invigorated Armed Forces that is robust, well-trained, adequately equipped, efficient, and fully motivated to protect Nigerians from the devastating effects of terrorism and other security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cThis screening exercise comes at the heels of Nigeria\u2019s twenty-two years of uninterrupted democratic experience. I must say that the relationship between the National Assembly and Armed Forces of Nigeria has progressively improved as the parliament continues to exercise the necessary democratic oversight of the defence sector.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate the firm resolve of the 9th House of Representatives, ably led by the Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and particularly, the Committees on Defence and that of Army\u2019s pledge to continually ensure a secure, peaceful, and prosperous country for all Nigerians. We will therefore continue to work with the Armed Forces of Nigeria to achieve this.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that the Joint Committees on Defence and Army will be thorough, transparent, and sincere in the conduct of this screening. We owe this to Nigerians as their representatives. Consequently, we seek your cooperation as we embark on this constitutional legislative process\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Defence, Bashiru Magashi who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry expressed optimism that the House would find the army chief worthy of confirmation.\n\nAsked to introduce himself and defend his appointment, Yahaya who chronicled his military exploits since his sojourn in the Nigeria Army 36 years ago said he was fit for the job and will deliver.\n\nHe said: \u201cI joined the Navy 36 years ago. So, I brought along with me 36 years of military experience. I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements of Abuja, and so on.\n\n\u201cI was involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterized by these areas I mentioned where I have first-hand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the chief of Army Staff if confirmed. What I brought is a wealth of experience and commitment. So, I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best and also having known what\u2019s required to achieve results.\n\n\u201cSecurity is everybody\u2019s business. The job cannot be done by one person. So we need all the support. And with the support of the people will win our fight against insecurity.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question of lack of synergy among the hierarchy of army, navy, air force, and other security agencies in the theatre of war posed by the chairman Committee, Namdas, Yahaya said there was perfect understanding, interaction, and cooperation within them.\n\nNamdas had attributed their inability to win the war in the north east to the lack of cooperation amongst the various security institutions.\n\nBut the army chief said he enjoyed a robust relationship with the other service chiefs who he said were well known to him even at the academy.\n\nHe however called for the cooperation of all Nigerians at various levels to enable him to succeed.\n\n\u201cFrom experience, this job can not be done by any single service or entity. Indeed, in the Army, the Army itself is a group work not individual that\u2019s why we arranged in sections and companies and battalions and brigades. This job is collective and as it was captured in the vision of the late Chief of Army Staff and in my own Mission too, there was also mention of the joint environment in what we do, having realized that this job is not one service job.\n\n\u201cNot only that, but it also requires other agencies, services, and stakeholders. We have always operated together that is why you see composition, Army, Navy, Airforce are there and now including the Police, DSS, Civil Defense.\n\n\u201cAt the Army headquarters level, all the Service Chiefs now, we are all mates at the Academy. At one time or the other, all of our work together. So, the synergy can\u2019t be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together, we have trained together.\n\n\u201cAs we know, internal security is intelligence-driven operation. So, we need others including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We work together\u201d, Yahaya said.",

Yahaya\n\n\u2026says no face-off between Army, Navy, Airforce, other security agencies\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\n\nHouse of Representatives, Tuesday, mandated the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, COAS, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya to end the threats of insecurity in the country if confirmed by the National Assembly.\n\nThe House said that war against insurgency in the north east region has cost the country a lot of financial resources with many lives lost.\n\nThe charges were handled down to the new army chiefs during his screening and confirmation by the Joint House Committees on Defence and Army respectively chaired by Hon. Babajimi Benson representing Ikorodu federal constituency of Lagos State and Abdulrazaq Namdas from Adamawa State.\n\nIt will be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari recently appointed Yahaya to replace former COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru who died in a plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nBenson who spoke for the Committees in his speech also tasked Yahaya on a virile army that would be result-oriented.\n\nHe assured the army of the continued support of the House of Representatives.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis exercise comes at a very challenging time in the history of our dear country, Nigeria.

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",
          "summary": "As far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security.\nThe Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\nAt what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019?\nSince most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes?",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling party to address the separatist agitations in the country through democratic means instead of deployment of military.\n\nHe said the fact that things are bad and people hungry and angry was not questionable, saying that these were worldwide phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Odigie-Oyegun decried the current security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that we will begin to get control of the security of this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke during the public presentation of a book, APC\u2019s Litmus Tests, written by Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022MEND warns Fulani group against planned attack\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nThe leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Chairman of Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), Chief Edwin Clark, yesterday expressed concern over the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari and Northern elders to threats by Fulani jihadists and Miyetti Allah to attack Delta State for supporting the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe told reporters in Abuja that given their promptness in reacting to similar threats to herdsmen, he had expected Buhari and the Northern elders to condemn the threats to Delta State.\n\nThe group, on Sunday, had given Delta State a 72-hour ultimatum to review its ban on open grazing or risk an attack.\n\nThe group stated that it was angered by the fact that the Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, hosted the May 11, 2021 meeting of the governors of the 17 Southern states in Asaba, where they resolved to ban open grazing in their domains.\n\nWhile claiming to be protecting the Uthman Dan Fodio heritage of free open grazing in Nigeria and the entire West Africa sub-region, the group asked Okowa to disown the position of the Southern governors on open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe group threatened to attack Asaba and Agbor unless Okowa withdrew his support to open grazing ban.\n\nIt also claimed responsibility for last week\u2019s fire at the Federal Secretariat in Asaba, which destroyed the second floor office of the NYSC completely.\n\nBut in a counter move, another group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta cautioned the self-styled \u2018Fulani Jihadists\u2019 group against attacking the state.\n\nClark, while condemning the silence of the federal government and Northern elders said open grazing was buried for good in all the 17 Southern states.\n\nAccording to him, the Northern elders who are always quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have not deemed it fit to call the jihadists to order.\n\nHe expressed concern that less than one week after leaders of thought, traditional rulers and others, including himself, met on the state of the nation, the Fulani jihadists issued a threat to attack Delta State.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have watched with restrained patience, the reckless and irresponsible utterances of the so-called Fulani jihadists and the Miyetti Allah, who believe that they own Nigeria from the North to the sea, and, therefore, have the impunity to warn state governments, particularly the Delta State government and governor, to withdraw, within 72 hours, his decision against open grazing, recently taken by the 17 governors of the South, in a meeting held in Asaba.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have decided to issue this advice and warning to the federal government and the Fulani jihadists that the people of the Niger Delta will resist in such a way that will make it definitely impossible for the federal government\u2019s security forces to cope with should this action escalate.\n\n\u201cWe are reacting because this is not the first time the Fulani and their collaborators have insulted our people. It will be remembered that sometime in 2009, a legislator from Kebbi State in the National Assembly asked the federal government to resettle the people of the Niger Delta in another territory to create a conducive and unhindered atmosphere for the oil companies to operate.\n\n\u201cThat we warn, the resulting consequences will be very unpleasant to them. The federal government has continuously condoned them and behaving as if the federal government is the one giving support to these Fulani Jihadists and the Miyetti Allah because what is happening today in Nigeria, which has resulted in unprecedented insecurity and bad governance in Nigeria will be worse if they are not called to order by the federal government within the shortest time possible.\n\n\u201cFor some Fulani Jihadists to issue such insulting and provocative 72 hours\u2019 notice to the governor of Delta State, without the federal government and the elders of Northern extraction ever calling them to order, is most disappointing, considering that the same Northern elders were quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning IPOB.\n\n\u201cSuch impudence of the Fulani Jihadists will no longer be tolerated. They even claimed responsibility for the burning/bombing of the secretariat in Asaba, which also houses the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Office.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision on open grazing and other decisions are taken on national interest by the 17 Southern governors received the full support of the people of Southern Nigeria, particularly the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo of the South-east, PANDEF of the South-south and the Afenifere of the South-west.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe will no longer tolerate hate and divisive statements targeted at deriding and insulting others, from these Fulani who believe Nigeria is exclusively theirs and other Nigerians are their subjects, and not their fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cI repeat, on behalf of Southerners, that open grazing has been finally buried in Southern Nigeria. For Mr. President to insist that open grazing should continue whereby he asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to dig out the gazette that approved open grazing in the First Republic is unbelievable, unpatriotic and unacceptable to our people.\u201d\n\nClark also explained how far critical stakeholders have gone in addressing the crisis rocking the country, saying that \u201cin order to maintain and promote a peaceful Nigeria, I was among other 50 prominent Nigerians, including former heads of state, traditional rulers, former chief justices, that met for nine hours, under the leadership of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, recently on Thursday, 11th June 2021, at the Conference Hall of the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, where valuable decisions were taken to maintain and sustain the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nClark told Buhari to regard himself as president of one Nigeria, and not as president of the Fulani or the Northerners, adding that Nigerians shall resist, at all cost, any attempt to subjugate them.\n\nHe cautioned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, against what he described as his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which he said is misleading the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI also use this opportunity to seriously advise the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which is misleading and misdirecting Mr. President. Because the rhetoric question Mr. President asked during his interview with ARISE Television, whether Nigerians want him (Mr. President) to contradict the Attorney-General of the Federation, was based on his understanding of the AG\u2019s advice to him.\n\n\u201cThe AG\u2019s position is provided for in the constitution and he is expected to be independent of parochial and unconstitutional government decisions. He behaves as if his position is that of a minister of justice alone.\n\n\u201cThis was the reason why at the 2014 National Conference it was recommended that the post of the Attorney-General recognised by the constitution should be separated from that of the minister of justice who owes his allegiance to the government in power that appointed him.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Mr. President is not aware, or he has not been advised by the AG that the Land Use Act, which vested ownership of land on the state governor is entrenched in the constitution of the country. Therefore, any gazette or law passed by any State or National Assembly is and will be null and void because the 1999 Constitution supersedes all such laws or gazette notices.\n\n\u201cThe President has no power or authority to impose open grazing on state governments. Such illegal actions which are a breach of the 1999 Constitution will not be accepted and will be legally resisted at all costs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any law banning open grazing by state governments is not only legal and binding but is unchallengeable and binding on any person or group of persons, including the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nClark, however, appealed to the president to call for national dialogue over insecurity and general violence, with Nigerians of various ethnic nationalities, adding that the various calls by groups for secession and breakup of the country are not healthy.\n\nHe said the Buhari needed to have a peaceful government until his exit from office in 2023, and canvassed the restructuring of the nation and return to a federal system of government as it was in 1963, before the military took over in 1966.\n\nMEND Warns \u2018Fulani Jihadist\u2019 Group against Attack on Delta\n\nMeanwhile, a group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta has cautioned a self-styled Fulani jihadist group against attacking Delta State.\n\nThe group warned of dire consequences should the Fulani or Usman Dan Fodio heritage leadership group carry out their threat to Delta and the governor, after the three-day ultimatum.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cResponse to the Fulani Threat to Okowa on Open Grazing by Southern Governors\u201d and signed off as \u201cDragon War, MEND\u201d, the group said: \u201cWe are warning that if your threat is made to come to fulfilment, No Fulani will ever exist across the Niger Delta and all oil facilities linked to a Fulani will be brought down. If one soul is lost, 10 Fulani souls will pay for it. If one facility is destroyed, 10 Fulani facilities will be destroyed. We will respond proportionately ten times whatever you give, the corresponding response will not be limited to the Delta, it may be with your politicians or with your rulers.\n\n\u201cWe will launch three rocket launchers and ballistic missiles at any facility of our choice as a warning in seven days if you make bold your threats.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make cheap our threats. We have shut down the country and we can at any time shut you down. We are the Niger Delta. We stand for the interest of the Niger Delta and we will not allow any coward to threaten us. We fight without running. Be warned!\u201d\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command, in a statement by its spokesman, Mr. Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, waved off the reported threat by the faceless group, describing it as inconsequential and something to simply ignore.\n\nThe statement by the police advised the people in the state to go about their lawful activities without fear of intimidation or attacks from any quarter.\n\nThe police attributed the source of the leaflet reportedly posted at different conspicuous points at Agbor and Asaba, including on walls near the Government House, as the handiwork of miscreants who were intent on creating panic among law-abiding residents in the state and escalating insecurity in the country.\n\nThe statement said the police were unwavering in their commitment to the security of lives and property of the people of Delta State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges Buhari not to bully secessionists, forget open grazing\n\nJames Emejo, Emmanuel Addeh, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nA Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, yesterday stated that Nigeria cannot remain one country if it fails to decentralise as fast as possible, adding that analysts, retired generals and others have maintained the same position.\n\nSoyinka spoke to ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to be more sensitive to the agitations of secessionists rather than bully them.\n\n\u201cIf it (Nigeria) fails to decentralise, some people use the word reconstruction, some use whatever. But if Nigeria fails to decentralise as fast as possible, manifestly, not as rhetoric, then Nigeria cannot stay together,\u201d he warned, adding: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not Wole Soyinka saying this. Everybody has said it; generals have said it; ex-heads of state have said it; politicians have said it; analysts have said it; economists have said it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to people in the streets. That\u2019s why they are moving; that\u2019s why they are demonstrating; that\u2019s why they are defying threats from the police and from the government that if you demonstrate, you are traitors or you do this, we\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that people are no longer intimidated by Buhari\u2019s threat that \u2018we will talk to you in the only way you understand.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t wash with anybody any longer because if a nation is on a suicidal slide, the people who feel that they do not deserve that kind of suicidal plunge have a right to say \u2018sorry, I am getting off before it nosedives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn how to make the system work again, he said: \u201cIt relates to what I was saying earlier. It is because he (Buhari) is not listening or he\u2019s listening and he\u2019s not understanding so that we do not have this extreme moment to say, wait a minute, there is nobody out there, we better look after our own security, we better look after our own very existence.\u201d\n\nHe accused governors and senators of not doing enough to confront the challenges facing the country.\n\nHe said while the Senate has not utilised its powers to force the government to act the way it should, the governors appeared to be too timid to act.\n\nSoyinka added that Buhari is not listening to the yearnings of Nigerians, and his administration did not really understand the applications, full responsibilities and commitments involved in a democratic regime.\n\nHe said he was alarmed at the understanding of democracy by the top hierarchy of government.\n\nHe stated that the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria aborted the various channels of self-expression open to any kind of polity and abrogated the essence of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe politicians are not doing enough, especially the Senate. If you study the constitution very carefully, you will find out that they have certain powers which they haven\u2019t touched. I have discussed this with constitutional lawyers. There are certain areas in which they can act, they can force this government, compel this government to act the way it should.\n\n\u201cAnd that also applies especially to governors. The governors themselves are too tentative; they are too timid. There are certain areas of the constitution, in which, as I go back to my favourite expression, they can push the envelope, completely, so that we get a sense of governance at all tiers, and have synergy going on. I think people are ready to stand behind the leaders.\u201d\n\nSoyinka said Twitter\u2019s suspension showed that democracy means different things to different people.\n\nHe also condemned the language used by Buhari in his interview recently and even in his statements from Aso Rock in relation to those who are clamouring for secession.\n\nAccording to him, when a group makes such agitations, any sensitive leadership must learn to understand this and respond to the reasons behind those agitations and not start threatening and bullying and trying to intimidate people because they are giving vent to deep-seated grievances.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor instance, there was a question I listened to President Buhari on this very channel (ARISE) about the position of the various governors on open grazing. At least 50 per cent of the nation has their representatives, saying that within the constitution, within the democratic dispensation that we say we are operating- we are saying on behalf of our people that we do not want open grazing anymore. And then somebody sits in Aso Rock and says to them that well, there is a cattle constitution, I am instructing my attorney-general to dig up some kind of law, colonial law which arbitrated between farmers and herders\u2026so that I can recover on behalf of a certain private business, the whole routes \u2013 which means that he is not listening to what people are saying, he\u2019s not listening to what the governors representing them are saying.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying I am going to restore the routes by referring to some colonial arrangements. Now, when I listen to a thing like that I really despair. I want to say this, it was a very instructive interview, and no doubt there was nothing new. One was just hoping that this government had transcended that kind of partisan thinking.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG committed to its loans repayment obligations, Says Amaechi\n\nJames Emejo, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday unfolded plans by the federal government to take more Chinese loans to expand rail services to more states.\n\nAmaechi, who featured on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said the federal government had already begun negotiations for the loans.\n\nIf granted, it will balloon Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock, which, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO), stood at $87.239 billion as of March 31, 2021.\n\nAlready, there has been an outcry against Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile since 2015.\n\nLast Thursday, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had admitted that the federal government was exceeding its borrowing plan for 2021.\n\nAhmed, in an interview with France 24, monitored by THISDAY, had blamed the development on the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices.\n\nHowever, Amaechi said Nigeria had been fulfilling its loan obligations as it had never defaulted in the repayment of loans, especially for the railway projects.\n\nHe stated that the federal government had so far repaid over $150 million out of the $500 million facility secured by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan for the Abuja-Kaduna railway.\n\nThe minister added that monthly revenue from the Abuja-Kaduna railway operation has increased from N70 million to N350 million as of May.\n\nHe also refuted the suggestion that some obnoxious clauses in the Chinese loan agreements may lead to mortgaging Nigeria\u2019s assets in the case of default.\n\nThe minister clarified that he was not behind the recent suspension of the Managing Director of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nHe said Bala-Usman was not suspended but only asked to \u2018step aside\u2019 to enable an investigation into the management of the authority from 2016 to date.\n\nAmaechi said President Muhammadu Buhari would decide on the resumption of the embattled NPA boss after the conclusion of the probe.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cWhen you take the loan, you are expected to pay back and as we are talking today we are paying back.\n\n\u201cUnder the regime of former President Goodluck Jonathan, the loan for Abuja \u2013 Kaduna was about $500 million. As of today, we have paid over $150 million on that loan.\n\n\u201cAnd Nigeria has never defaulted when it comes to loan repayment. And I don\u2019t also expect that we will default on any other loan we have taken.\n\n\u201cThe loan for Ibadan-Kano is about $1.5 billion. The rest of $500 million came from our budget. I expect that whatever loans we take we will be able to pay.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that there is any clause in the loan agreement that hands over any of our national assets to China.\n\n\u201cYes, in default they go to court and it depends on the outcome of the court case, but I am not aware that there is anything in all the clauses signed by this government or the previous government of Goodluck Jonathan that mortgaged any of our national assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line of the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri railway as well as that of Kano -Maradi will commence in June.\n\nHe added that the Lagos-Kano narrow gauge is currently being negotiated with different interest groups willing to rehabilitate it.\n\nHe explained: \u201cWhat we are going to start this June is the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line.\n\nWe are rehabilitating Port Harcourt -Maiduguri and at the same time the president has directed that contract be awarded for the standard gauge, which should be funded when the next government comes.\n\n\u201cBut the difference between the narrow gauge and the standard gauge is just the speed. The Lagos -Kano narrow gauge is the one we are negotiating with different interest groups who want to rehabilitate.\n\n\u201cThat one is for rehabilitation. And when they finish rehabilitation, they will then run it by themselves and make their money and pay themselves back. We\u2019ve not even commenced negotiation.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said more Chinese loans would be needed to extend the railway services to other states.\n\nHe said although the Lagos-Ibadan rail line had been completed, the services were still skeletal because it would take six months to test equipment to ensure they are in perfect condition.\n\nHe, however, stated that to extend the railway service from Ibadan to Osogbo and from Kano to Kaduna as well as other states in the country, the country would need to get more Chinese loans of which negotiations were already in progress.\n\n\u201cIt takes six months to know that that equipment is in perfect condition. We would continue to test the equipment so that we do not have any train accidents. So we are moving from just two services in a day to four. It will be a gradual progression and I believe that by the end of the year, we will be doing 16 trips in a day,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe also said the continuation of the rail line would only commence when the Chinese loan was obtained, adding that the ministry has already mobilised contractors with some funds pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we get the Chinese loan, we would commence the construction of Ibadan to Abuja, but before the end of this month, we should commence some of the Kano-Kaduna rail. We have already mobilised the contractors with some funds and we would fund it initially from our budget pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded\u201d, Amaechi said.\n\nOn the security of the railway system against the backdrop of the activities of vandals and other economy saboteurs, Amaechi canvassed the amendment of the law to make perpetrators liable for manslaughter as well as serve as a deterrence to others.\n\nHe said terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa seaport.\n\nAccording to him, the Apapa seaport\u2019s only problem is efficiency, citing the drastic change in the port on the day the president visited to inaugurate the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was in the train with the president on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the port that looked like a marketplace was very well organised; no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe stated: \u201cIf they had the capacity in just one night, because I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; if that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the president to come before we can be efficient?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done was to have a meeting with the terminal operators and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the seaport? The seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the seaport unless I have business in the seaport.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said the Ministry of Transportation would partner the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding that freighting of cargoes from the seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also ease congestion at the ports.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says terminal operators to contribute to reconstruction of Apapa port\n\nSays deep blue project to solve maritime insecurity, boost revenue, reduce oil production cost\n\nBy Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi, has said the problem of Apapa seaport is efficiency, citing the drastic changes in the Port on the day the President visited to commission the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe also said that terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa Seaport.\n\nThe Minister stated this Monday when he appeared as a guest on The Morning Show on Arise TV, THISDAY broadcast arm.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was in the train with the President on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the Port that looked like a market place was very well organised, no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the Seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe observed that if they had the capacity in just one night, \u201cbecause I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; If that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the President to come before we can be efficient?\u201d Amaechi queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done, was to have a meeting with the terminal operators, and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa Seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa Seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the Seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the Seaport? The Seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as Minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the Seaport unless I have business in the seaport\u201d, he added.\n\nAmaechi noted that the Ministry of Transportation will partner with the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding thatt freighting of cargoes from the Seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also help in arresting the situation at the Port.\n\n\u201cWe are going to partner with customs because they are largely involved. Between them and the NPA, they are the operators (or regulators) of the Seaport, and see how to arrest this situation. I believe that when we begin to freight cargoes from the seaport through the rail, we\u2019ll reduce some of the challenges that we have at the seaport\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also spoke on the recently launched Deep Blue Project being overseen by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, stating that the project will not only boost security in the country\u2019s waters, but will also improve trade in the Gulf of Guinea and reduce cost of production for the Oil industry, while improving revenue for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cbefore we came, various contractors were contracted to provide security for oil companies in the water. There was a case between the government and OMSL in which the company provides about 3 or 4 boats to the Navy and they collect $2500 per vessel for the first day and $1500 for about 30 days. In a year, like in 2020 they made about $67m, and when you hand over the security of a country to individuals, it becomes very challenging and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cSo, the President kindly approved that the Police, Army, Air force and other security agencies should be involved in providing security with the equipment that we have provided.\n\n\u201cWe have about 3 helicopters, 2 fixed-wing planes, 17 interceptor boats, 2 vessels, drones, and more; what it does is that it gives you information about where the criminals are, those who go and destroy pipes just because they are looking for oil to bunker.\n\n\u201cIt provides you that information, then you deter them or arrest them. So, we are able to provide security in the coastal region, both on land and on the sea. Now, those who provide the coastal security on land will be the Nigerian Army and the Police, and we\u2019ve provided them with all the necessary tools they need.\n\n\u201cWe have ammunition, we have vehicles, like Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and all that for patrol by the coast. All that, we believe will begin to yield fruits between now and next year.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Amaechi said, \u201cWhat , we\u2019ve done with Deep Blue project is that we will reduce the cost of producing oil in Nigeria, because in producing oil, they also build-in the cost of security. By the time we provide this security in the water, the economy will be improved because there will be more money coming into the economy. That\u2019s the impact it will have when it comes to the Deep Blue project.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Israelis who did the training said in six months to one year, if there is no improvement in the economy in terms of how much comes in, both to NIMASA, NPA and the oil industry, \u2018come back to us and we\u2019ll be willing to refund.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you know it is simple mathematics; It is true that the moment you can take away the criminals from the water, and the contractors from the water, then the cost of security which is borne either by NNPC or the Oil Companies will be part of what will come back to us as income. Then on land, in all our rail and train coaches, you have enough armed policemen in any trip we are making to withstand any criminal attack.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerians on social media have called out former Super Eagles midfielder, Mikel Obi, for pledging support for the political aspirations of Kogi governor, Yahaya Bello.\n\nOn Sunday, Obi paid a courtesy visit to Bello in Abuja during which he lauded the achievements of the governor.\n\nHe was quoted as saying, \u201cIt is an honour for me to finally meet his Excellency personally after all the good things I have heard and read about him from not just the people of Kogi State but from Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMy main aim is to come here to show my appreciation and to thank him for all the things he has been doing for the people and also to support him in whatever future political positions he wants to go into.\n\n\u201cI will like to be there to support him, to be there by his side through this journey for him to achieve whatever he wants which is for the betterment of Nigeria.\"\n\nObi said he was hopeful that Bello and himself could work together as a team to achieve success.\n\nHowever, Nigerian tweeps have taken to their social media handles to call out Obi over his comments stressing that Bello's administration was not deserving of such accolade.\n\nMany social media users expressed the belief that Obi must have been paid or is seeking a political position, hence his comment.\n\nThis comes as human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, via his Twitter handle on Monday, described Obi as a sycophant.\n\nSowore wrote, \"@mikel_john_obi As ur career in football flames out, another one starts in sycophancy + ass licking! At least for sycophancy, you don\u2019t need any rigorous practice! Enjoy it while it lasts with\n\n@OfficialGYBKogi the most irresponsible and incompetent Nigerian governor below 50.\"\n\nOther reactions of Nigerians on social media are as follows:\n\n\n\nI really don't know what's wrong with some of our celebrities, Mikel Obi,in south east, d youths , where you comes from are been killed everday https://t.co/9HBk3FWdcP, taken away to the unknown, yet you are busy raisng hand with yeye Bello for 2023 election.Commo sense brother. \u2014 Chidi Obiukwu (@chidiobiukwu01) June 15, 2021\n\n@mikel_john_obi me no dey fear to tag anybody.\n\nGuy if you really said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cYahaya Bello is the best youth to lead Nigeria\u00e2\u0080\u009d, then on behalf of well meaning Nigerians I put it to you that you're the most miserable fool. \u2014 CJN (@onowu_jn) June 15, 2021\n\n@mikel_john_obi that is why you are a bench warmer at chelsea for almost a decade. https://t.co/tc3UvaTf3d \u2014 Blaq boy (@bethelblaq) June 15, 2021\n\nStill shocked @mikel_john_obi does not know he's a more better candidate than clueless #YahayaBello.\n\nIm only keeping quiet bcos I know his statement is not bcos of money or hunger.\n\nPerhaps in due cause, I'll ask him why he made that statement.#Nigeria \u2014 L O R D _ Z E U S (@mr_clyn) June 15, 2021\n\n@mikel_john_obi what on Earth will make you flinch support for a politician that bastardized electoral institution, stole votes, hijacked electoral materials and people got shot at and murdered for his quest to be governor. Economic hardship of his people.\n\nGuy you messed up. \u2014 Kay Gezzy (@AlpacinoViruz) June 15, 2021\n\n@mikel_john_obi before you endorse yahaya as the next president please investigate what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing in the state he is mandated to serve as governor now, then ask yourself if such person is what will need to transform/change the current Nigeria... \u2014 Gold \u00f0\u009f\u0094\u009d \u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00ac\u00f0\u009f\u0087\u00a7 (@koollykice73) June 15, 2021\n\nSomething has exchanged hands. It's sad to even imagine it will be money that will make someone of Mikel Obi's reputation and supposed wealth descend into this shameless abyss. https://t.co/hxfVjr6DcW \u2014 FO (@femiwole) June 15, 2021\n\nAm sure Obi has no need for Bello's money or respect, he should have turned down the man's request. Bello is completely toxic to the future of youths in Nigeria. \u2014 EKWO SAMUEL GEORGE (@official_Ekwo) June 14, 2021\n\nAll the exposure he had in England profited him nothing. He literally was passive to their civilisation and this is the proof. \u2014 Ejike McVirtue (@EMcvirtue) June 15, 2021\n\n@MikelObi_12 I have always loved you right from your days at plateau United. But this is a let down, how on earth can you associate yourself with this miscreant Yeye Bello \u2014 #Endbadgovernance (@01Donoil) June 14, 2021\n\nFrom observation, the Kogi governor is notorious for hampering freedom of speech and expression within his state.\n\nFor instance, two anti-President Muhammadu Buhari protesters, Larry Emmanuel and Victor Udoka were arrested in Kogi state for exercising their fundamental human rights, under Bello's administration.\n\nIrate mob flogged the two youths, filmed them and brutalised them before they were later handed over to the police.\n\nIt was gathered that the police thereafter quizzed the two protesters and detained them when they insisted on seeing their lawyer before making a statement. They were also secretly arraigned in court, without having access to their lawyers.",

And finally, my unit was located at Kata town, member of number 16 and for those conversant with that deployment, Kata town was the last deployment of the ECOMOG who were the ones facing Charles Tylor NPFLA there.\n\n\u201cSo, all activities including wars and operations, including of course negotiations, were conducted by my unit on behalf of ECOMOG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have severally hosted the United Nations negotiations in Kakata.

We also fought our way to that end.\n\n\u201cSo, if you will, I have first-hand experience, barely three years after my passing out in war and its processes, similar to what we are facing now.\n\n\u201cAfter that, when we came back to the country, I was also promoted to guards brigade here where I served as platoon commander. So, I am also abreast with the security requirement of Abuja itself and the parade and other requirements that characterised that deployment.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, I grew up in my career to become commanding officer in guards brigade garrison in Abuja here, and so I was involved in all the security requirements of securing Abuja and, particularly, the presidential villa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYahaya said going by his military experience, he is well equipped to tackle the security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cLooking at my career, I have virtually seen it all.

I was involved also in internal security operations both there and here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere also, I have been to the north-west like I mentioned, south-south like I mentioned, and to the north-east. The challenges we are facing now are characterised by what I have mentioned. I have first-hand information where I have commanded troops and administered them in achieving what we have done.\n\n\u201cWhat I brought is the certificate of experience and commitment I have had all across my career.

And finally, my unit was located at Kata town, member of number 16 and for those conversant with that deployment, Kata town was the last deployment of the ECOMOG who were the ones facing Charles Tylor NPFLA there.\n\n\u201cSo, all activities including wars and operations, including of course negotiations, were conducted by my unit on behalf of ECOMOG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have severally hosted the United Nations negotiations in Kakata. We have hosted other factional leaders, including Kromah, Johnson, and others in those negotiations. We also fought our way to that end.\n\n\u201cSo, if you will, I have first-hand experience, barely three years after my passing out in war and its processes, similar to what we are facing now.\n\n\u201cAfter that, when we came back to the country, I was also promoted to guards brigade here where I served as platoon commander. So, I am also abreast with the security requirement of Abuja itself and the parade and other requirements that characterised that deployment.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, I grew up in my career to become commanding officer in guards brigade garrison in Abuja here, and so I was involved in all the security requirements of securing Abuja and, particularly, the presidential villa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYahaya said going by his military experience, he is well equipped to tackle the security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cLooking at my career, I have virtually seen it all. I have seen war in other countries; I have seen how it was done. I was involved also in internal security operations both there and here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere also, I have been to the north-west like I mentioned, south-south like I mentioned, and to the north-east. The challenges we are facing now are characterised by what I have mentioned. I have first-hand information where I have commanded troops and administered them in achieving what we have done.\n\n\u201cWhat I brought is the certificate of experience and commitment I have had all across my career. Throughout my career, I have been appointed as at when due. I am determined to provide my best, having known what is required to achieve result.\u201d",

          "text": "The Italian ministry of justice on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into the conduct of two prosecutors in a corruption case over Eni and Shell\u2019s acquisition of oil prospecting licence (OPL) 245 in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ministry said the prosecutors hid vital evidence that would have exonerated Eni.\n\nIn 2011, Royal Dutch Shell and Eni paid $1.3 billion to purchase an offshore oil field (OPL 245) from Malabu Oil and Gas, a company Dan Etete, former minister of petroleum, had major shares in.\n\nIt is alleged that about $1.1 billion was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut an Italian court acquitted Shell, Eni and other defendants of corruption charges in the oil deal, after more than three years of court appearances.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Milan prosecutors Fabio De Pasquale (pictured) and Sergio Spadaro were placed under official investigation by magistrates earlier this month for allegedly failing to file documents that would have supported Eni\u2019s position.\n\nThe justice ministry, in a statement, said that it had decided to move in the wake of the judicial investigation and following criticism of the pair by the trial judges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ministry has asked the inspectorate to carry out preliminary investigations to correctly reconstruct the facts by acquiring the necessary documents,\u201d it said.\n\nIn papers filed on June 9, the judges criticised the way the prosecutors had carried out their work, saying they had failed to file with the trial documents a video shot by a former Eni external lawyer, which they said was relevant to the case.\n\nReuters reported that De Pasquale and Spadaro declined to comment on the latest development.\n\nHowever, Milan\u2019s attorney general said he supports the two men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018HIDING VITAL EVIDENCE\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Mohammed Bello Adoke, who was the Nigerian attorney-general when the deal was signed in 2011, had earlier alleged that the Italian prosecutors hid vital evidence from the court which would have exonerated him of alleged bribery in the transaction.\n\nAlthough Adoke was not on trial in Italy, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has put him on trial in Nigeria over allegations of money laundering.\n\nAdoke alleged that the Italian prosecutors deliberately concealed his failed N300 million mortgage transaction with Unity Bank from the Milan court just to create the impression that he collected a bribe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also alleged that an email purportedly sent by him from the account of a property company mentioned in the OPL 245 payments was forged.\n\nAdoke also alleged that a phone conversation was stage-managed to implicate him.\n\nIn it, somebody posing as Adoke was heard saying he knew the OPL 245 deal was \u201ca presidential fraud\u201d.\n\nFollowing a petition by Adoke, the police quizzed Olanrewaju Suraju, chairman of HEDA, over allegations of forgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHEDA is the Nigerian partner of the international campaigners who helped the Italian prosecutors in the OPL 245 trial.\n\nThe Corner House, Re:Common and Global Witness worked with HEDA to generate global media publicity over the trial.\n\nSuraju said the email attributed to Adoke was sourced from the Italian prosecutors, who are now likely to face trial for misconduct.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s sole trade union in the telecommunications industry, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN), has threatened to go on a nationwide three-day warning strike over alleged violation of national labour laws by employers. This could result in a disruption to cellular and data services, and potentially affect the broader economy.\n\nIn a statement reported by local media, the association said it was embarking on the strike from June 16 to protest against \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisation\u201d as well as disregard for decent conditions of employment, among other allegations.\n\nAccording to reports, less than 5% of workers in the telecoms industry are hired on a permanent basis with most companies relying on subcontracting and outsourcing, a practice that shortchanges workers. Meanwhile, big telecom operators are reportedly laying off their managerial staff for reasons tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe association\u2019s president, Opeyemi Tomori, and General Secretary Okonu Abdullahi cited increasing precarious working conditions in the sector, such as disregard for occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nPTECSSAN also alleged breaches of the freedom of association, the right of workers to organise, victimisation of union members, poor and discriminatory remuneration, abuse of the expatriate quota, intimidation, harassment and verbal assaults of employees, among other anti-labour practices.\n\nTelecom operators reportedly do not allow trade unionism and deny workers\u2019 rights to collective bargaining as spelled out in International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions.\n\nPTECSSAN demanded that HUAWEI Technologies Nigeria Limited, ATC, 9mobile, Globacom, Smile, IHS, Airtel, IPNX Nigeria, Spectranet, MAINONE, Ntel, Swift and other companies that have not allowed their employees to join labour unions should respect the right of the workers to freely associate with the association.\n\nLast year, the association clashed with MTN Nigeria over similar allegations, having accused the South African telco of discrimination against Nigerians and disregard of workers\u2019 rights. The Nigerian government had to step in to avert a strike action planned by the union.\n\nThe state might have to intervene in this case again due to the magnitude. If embarked on, the planned industrial action would be the first nationwide strike by workers in the telecoms industry. It is sure to disrupt services across the country, with potential huge losses for businesses and individuals.\n\nAffiliated with the National Labour Congress, PTECSSAN is one of the largest trade associations in Nigeria being the only union in the telecommunications sector. It has as members all the employees in the industry.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "Fatura, a Cairo-based tech startup that connects wholesalers and manufacturers with retailers through a mobile application, on Monday said it has raised $3 million in pre-Series A funding. The round was co-led by Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital with participation from Egypt Ventures, EFG-EV, Cairo Angels, and Khwarizmi Ventures.\n\nThe company was founded in late 2019 by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, and Abdallah Moheb El-Din, and had previously raised an undisclosed amount of money in a seed round in July.\n\nFatura sells inventory to grocery retailers using a network of manufacturers and wholesalers in different industries. It has been operating in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector since its launch.\n\nThe startup uses an asset-light approach, which means it doesn\u2019t own any inventory and, through its mobile app, simply shares orders with producers and distributors who fulfil them.\n\nThere are currently over 500 sellers on the marketplace who have served 25,000 retailers through Fatura\u2019s platform in 20 governorates across Egypt. More than 10,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) are exchanged on the business-to-business (B2B) platform, which has already crossed 1 billion Egyptian pounds (about $64 million) in yearly gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity in the B2B space in Egypt that is growing as the players are becoming digitally mature and ready. Collectively, the digital B2B players in the FMCG space capture less than five percent of the market and there is a long way to go,\u201d Hossam Ali said in an official press release announcing the latest funding.\n\nAfter recording significant success in the consumer goods sector, Fatura is now running a pilot in other industries.\n\nIt has already introduced a digital lending service with a focus on retail financing and aims to add more services in that area in the near future. Beyond e-commerce and lending, the startup expects the investment to help it extend its services with a view to optimising the exchange of goods, money and information in the B2B context while focusing on convenience and user experience.\n\nThe startup plans to use the new funds to introduce services that support the different players in its ecosystem, offer several digitisation initiatives with a focus on digital payments, and expand to other countries in the North African region.\n\nOn the company\u2019s future expansion plans, the CEO said Fatura\u2019s conviction is to \u201cstay asset-light, be inclusive to all the industry stakeholders and to attract the best on-ground acquisition force across the country.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has announced a tender process for the sale of a 40% stake in state-owned telecommunications company, Ethio Telecom. That means potential investors can now register their interest starting Tuesday. This is the first stage in a lengthy process that will lead to the selection of a successful bidder.\n\nThe proposed minority sale of Ethio Telecom \u2013 the sole mobile services provider in a country of over 100 million people \u2013 is part of a broader plan to liberalise the country\u2019s monopolistic telecoms sector. In addition, two foreign carriers are to be granted licenses to operate in the hugely untapped market.\n\n\u201cThe government wants state-owned enterprises to be competitive and productive, the authorities\u2019 motivation for selling a part of Ethio Telecom to private operators,\u201d Deputy Director of Public Enterprises, Holding and Administration Agency, Zinabu Yirga, said at a press conference in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday. \u201cAs part of the broader opening up of the sector, Ethiopia is also moving to license private operators to compete with Ethio Telecom.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in 2019 and driven by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the liberalisation plan has been met with several delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an internal crisis in the Tigray region.\n\nHowever, the plan has gathered pace over the past six months. In May, the government awarded one of the two available private operating licences to break up Ethio Telecom\u2019s monopoly on the sector.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a telco-consortium led by Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, was announced as the winner after a successful bid of around $850 million. Meanwhile, a second offer of around $600 million from South Africa\u2019s MTN Group was deemed too low by the regulator, which is now preparing to reauction the final licence.\n\nAccording to Brook Taye, a senior advisor at the finance ministry, the 40% in Ethio Telecom will be sold as a single stake to a single investor. It is however unclear how much the stake would be worth but the tender process is sure to attract significant interest from many telcos around the world.\n\nThis is due to the attractiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s untapped telecoms market. In a population of over 100 million people, only about 20% have access to the Internet, less than 40% have a mobile phone and only 5.8% of the people use social media, according to a report from DataReportal.\n\nFounded in November 2010, Ethio Telecom currently has around 53 million subscribers and has since December generated a revenue of around $600 million. According to reports, the government plans to retain a 55% stake in the operator while the remaining 5% will be offered to domestic investors through an initial public offering.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "A new online conversation App, tribe naija has berthed in the Nigerian online space. The App is a community-based platform specifically developed for Nigerians to network and have conversations on issues of common interest.\n\nThe tribe naija App was launched in Abuja on June 12, 2021 during the Fireside Chat event held at the Sheu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre in commemoration of Democracy Day.\n\nThe App, which is currently available for download on the Google Apps store and IOS for iPhone users is a brainchild of the Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative, The Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the App, the founder, Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative, Chief Kola Abiola, son of Late Chief MKO Abiola, winner of the June 12, 1993 election described the platform as a \u2018child of necessity\u2019 that has come to give Nigerians the opportunity to bring their voice together especially as it relates to issues that affect them.\n\nAccording to him, the creation of the App was informed by the need to use technology to promote cohesion and inclusion among Nigerians using some of the knowledge or lessons gained from political leaders and thinkers such as Moshood Abiola and Shehu Yar\u2019Adua among others while they were alive.\n\nAbiola noted that the tribe naija App, developed and designed by Mewa international LLC, is expected to serve as a safe haven for Nigerians to talk and be heard. He stressed that the platform would offer Nigerians regardless of age a forum to discuss and chat about all the issues affecting their well being as citizens.\n\nHe disclosed that the app is meant to drive like-minded conversations geared towards the improvement of the country and create a platform for them to prepare for a better future.\n\n\u201cBy speaking, we would erase the divide and understand each other better. I think to a great degree we would see that we have a lot more than we think we have in common and that is why this app has been developed. We have been working on the development of the app for more than 2 years even though I have been nurturing this idea ten years ago. On this app, there is a voice note. You can leave messages through voice notes. We are going to have language variations as we go along which I think is enormous\u2019 he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the technical consultant, Tribe Naija, Mr. Fady Khatib explained that the app is unique considering the value it is bringing to the table for Nigerians.\n\nHe stressed that the platform remains open to a wide range of matters for discussion including both cultural and scientific, adding that it is an ecosystem where one can come to a group and discuss mainstream and unconventional ideas.\n\nCommenting on the features of the platform, he disclosed that the application has many pockets and is designed to accommodate all methods of communication including voice chat adding that users can take part in any discussion without having to type.\n\n\u201cYou are in the comfort of your living room and would like to be part of the discussion, you can contribute using voice chat. Even while debating, you don\u2019t need to type. It is also a platform that enables users to dislike, like or get a reply on any topic under discussion\u201d, he added.\n\nHe further noted that the app has been built with user-generated pockets that allow each of the users to become the moderator of its own topic. He stated that though the platform was open to all classes of people, the conversation that goes on in the platform is guided by rules and regulations which every user must comply with.\n\n\u201cIt does not come without proper monitoring, When you are on such platform, you are guided by the rules and regulation of its operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe technical consultant revealed that the platform precludes users from the opportunity to buy and sell but rather to pitch ideas or innovation.",

          "title": "Tips to help you stay safe online when transferring funds to & from Nigeria",
          "text": "Gbenga Okejimi, Country Manager for Nigeria and Ghana, WorldRemit\n\nNigeria remains the largest recipient of diaspora remittance in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 in 2019, it received nearly half of the remittances sent to the region at $23.8 billion. Money transfers sent from Nigerians living and working in the diaspora have always been an important source of income for families and the Nigerian economy. According to PWC report titled \u201cStrength from Abroad\u201d, remittances can have a strong impact on development because of the ripple effect on consumption, investment and economic growth.\n\nTechnological innovations continue to ease the process of sending and receiving money, thus facilitating growth. Digital money transfer methods have made cross border financial transactions, and now, a process that could otherwise take days has been reduced to just a few minutes. The uptake of digital financial services at home means that more Nigerians can send and receive money from across the world. The process has been supported by favourable regulations from the Central Bank of Nigeria to boost remittances inflow.\n\nAs online payments continue to get faster and more convenient, and as Nigerians pivot to digital channels for remittance transfer, service providers must deliver secure connections for these digital transactions and reduce the risk of cybercrime.\n\nAt WorldRemit, we take very seriously the privacy and security of our customers. Our website and apps are designed to prevent accounts from unauthorized login attempts; we have strict verification processes to ensure that we correctly identify all of our customers and have a team of dedicated analysts who monitor transactions for signs of unusual activity.\n\nWe have provided a secure platform and developed a robust verification model but as a company that goes the extra mile we want our customers to stay aware of the following tips to avoid wahala:\n\nBeware of fake brands and businesses. A common trick involves impersonation, a user behind a fake social media account may attempt to convince you that they\u2019re someone they\u2019re not to gain your trust. Look out for catchphrases like \u2018invest and reap 10x return\u2019, once you\u2019ve parted with your money you\u2019re unlikely to be able to contact the fake account again. Verify users, brands and businesses before transacting with them. Where possible contact the brand directly via their website and ask for recommendations from trusted parties before making transactions or investments.\n\nDownload apps only from reliable sources. Make sure that you only download apps from reliable sources, make use of verified links from the organizations\u2019 websites and official social media accounts. Use your app store on Apple devices, or the google play store on Android devices, etc. Take extra care before downloading an app, confirm that it provides a service that is recognized by local and international financial services authorities.\n\nNever share your passwords and token codes. Legitimate financial services providers will never ask you to share your passwords, token codes or any other private information. While your credit or debit card pin can be used to complete payments online, and your Bank verification Number (BVN) might need to be submitted within an app or website, to digital financial services providers, in the process of setting up your personal account, you must never share these details via message requests from supposed providers. Go the extra mile and make sure the money transfer service is committed to protecting your personal data. At WorldRemit, our payment partners in recipient countries will verify your identity, while ensuring your data is protected at all times. We also respect privacy policies in line with the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) requirements and will never share data with any third party.\n\nConfirm the recipient\u2019s identity and channel. Always confirm the identity of your recipient, this is anyone seeking financial assistance from you or offering unsolicited investment opportunities. If you suspect that your emails have been hacked, confirm the transaction directly, or through a regulatory authority before completing the process. For transactions via WorldRemit, confirm the recipient\u2019s identity and how they will receive the money, whether it is cash pickup, mobile money, or bank transfer. Make sure you are using the beneficiary\u2019s full legal name, as the bank in the receiving country will match their identification with the transfer information.\n\nSpeed is of the essence. Pick a service that ensures your money reaches its intended destination quickly and securely. 90% of transfers made with WorldRemit are authorized within minutes. Also, check if the platform has a 24-hour customer care service that is operational. At WorldRemit, our customer service is available 24/7.\n\nTrack your money transfer. The part of the operation where most safety is required is in the monitoring of the transaction. When sending money, WorldRemit enables users to monitor the status of their transactions, providing senders as well as recipients with status updates along the way for peace of mind. Last year, WorldRemit launched a Transfer Tracker App which allows recipients of money transfers to track their funds. The app is free to download through the Google app store in a number of countries including Nigeria.\n\nDisclaimer: WorldRemit and its affiliates do not provide financial advice. This article has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for financial advice.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFatura\u2019s latest funding round\n\nEthio Telecom\u2019s 40% stake sale\n\nYouTube\u2019s latest ad ban\n\nEgypt-based Fatura raises $3m pre-series A\n\nFatura Co-founders. Source:MENAbytes\n\nEgypt-based Business to Business (B2B) e-commerce platform, Fatura, announced a $3 million pre-series A round on Monday, June 14, 2021. Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital led the round.\n\nOther investors in the round include Egypt Ventures, The Cairo Angels, Saudi Arabia-based VC, Khwarizmi Ventures, and fintech-focused accelerator, EFG-EV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, a pre-series A round is fundraising done by a startup in the interim between the seed round and the series A round. In July 2020, the startup raised an undisclosed seed round, and this is their second funding round since then.\n\nFatura is a platform that sells grocery inventories to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retailers via a mobile application. With a network that connects manufacturers with wholesalers, the startup can meet those inventory needs. On the app, sellers can manage their pricing lists, manage stocks, and receive orders.\n\nThis latest funding will be used to expand to more cities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The startup also plans to go beyond meeting retailers\u2019 need for FMCGs and create additional services like a digital payment platform to foster ease-of-business for retailers.\n\nCo-founded by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, AbdAllah Mohebeldin, and Ahmed Al Bakary \u2014 who joined the team later \u2014 Fatura launched in Cairo, Egypt, in 2020. So far, the startup has 500 sellers, wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers on the marketplace, having provided service to 25,000 retailers across Egypt.\n\nThings have been quite interesting, as the MENA region\u2019s e-commerce sector has experienced steady growth. According to a Bain & Company report, it was worth $8.3 billion as of 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25%, most of which Egypt accounts for.\n\nWith such significant growth, we could witness the rise of more startups with product offerings geared towards boosting Egypt\u2019s e-commerce sector.\n\nEthiopian government to sell 40% stake of Ethio Telecom\n\nThe Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) has launched a tender to aid the partial privatisation of state-owned telecommunication operator, Ethio Telecom. With this in place, interested private investors can apply, and the chosen bidder will own a 40% stake in Ethio Telecom.\n\nProspective investors have to go through a few stages, the first being submitting a special form-like request called Expression of Interest (EOI). Other stages in the process will be revealed later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthiopia is one of the few countries globally to have a monopoly on telecom providers. However, this move is part of plans to open up the country\u2019s largest and most lucrative sector to private investors.\n\nIn February, we reported that Kenyan telecom giant, Safaricom, was one of the final six companies shortlisted for bids on two telecom licences in Ethiopia. And they got it in May, alongside Sumitomo Corporation and the CDC Group.\n\nThis move to sell off a 40% stake to private investors further shows the country\u2019s commitment to encouraging healthy competition in the region, as shielding the sector from competition might slow down innovation.\n\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t be quick to forget Ethiopia\u2019s erratic approach to Internet censorship,\n\nYouTube to ban certain topics from its masthead ad banner\n\nGoogle-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, has made some updates to its masthead ad placement policies.\n\nBeginning from Monday, June 21, 2021, YouTube will not allow ads about alcohol sale, gambling, prescription drugs, elections, and politics to run on its homepage \u2014 the platform\u2019s biggest ad unit.\n\nPer Axios, this move is a part of Google\u2019s commitment to \u201cminimize confusion, misinformation and manipulation, especially surrounding sensitive events.\u201d\n\nOne might wonder if YouTube isn\u2019t too late to the party, as giant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have since placed bans on ads related to political topics. This story gives further context to how these bans took effect during Nigeria\u2019s general elections in 2019.\n\nYou might want to make some excuses for YouTube. Perhaps, the platform wasn\u2019t as strongly exploited as Facebook and Twitter, so the need for permanent restriction measures didn\u2019t arise. However, they placed a temporary ban on political ads following the January 6 Capitol Insurrection.\n\nBut then, the best-performing videos on YouTube are usually longer than 10 minutes, enough time to capture nuance and context that Twitter and Facebook inherently can\u2019t.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa.

          "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a medical expert to know the value of blood to humans. At a basic level, most people understand that the absence of blood in a human is fatal, yet blood donation rates in most African countries are low.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 112.5 million blood donations are collected worldwide. Still, more than half of this number is gathered in high-income countries \u2014 home to only 19% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nWorryingly, the United Nations estimates that more than 536,000 women die during childbirth, with 99% of them living in developing countries. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of deaths, responsible for 40% of maternal deaths in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBlood donation and supply remain major challenges in Africa as health officials battle logistical problems and cultural barriers. Consequently, family and friends donate most of the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood. Worse still, they may not be matching blood donors.\n\nSolving Africa\u2019s blood donation problem requires more than calling for voluntary donors. In most places, officials have to contend with superstitions or cultural limitations that make people unwilling to donate.\n\nAlso, the infrastructure needed to transport the blood is often absent in most parts of the continent. With Africa\u2019s infrastructure challenges, it is difficult to say how many lives have been lost because they lacked access to blood.\n\nWHO advises that most of the blood donated come from voluntary donors, but that is not the case in all countries, especially in developing ones.\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Coordinator of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), Dr Omale Amedu, revealed that only 5% of the blood collected in the country were from voluntary donors, with the remaining 95% commercially provided.\n\nMost African countries can\u2019t meet their annual blood requirements and increase millions of women, children, and accident victims\u2019 risk of mortality (ROM). In 2016, WHO estimated that Africa only covered 50% of its blood requirements.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, reports that the country needs 2 million units of blood annually but only collects 60,000 units. Cameroon, on the other hand, needs about 400,000 units of blood but collects only 90,000 units. The trend of supply failing to meet demand is common across Africa.\n\nThe startups below are using technology to solve the problems blood banks and hospitals face and close the gap between supply and demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifebank\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun founded Lifebank in 2016. After suffering complications during pregnancy and needing a blood transfusion in the United States, she began to think of the millions of women back in Nigeria who could have lost their lives if they had been in her shoes.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with CNN, the entrepreneur said, \u201cI realised after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum haemorrhage. The most important thing you can do when a mum is haemorrhaging is replacing the blood she has lost, even if you can\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThis epiphany was all she needed to start Lifebank to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly served over 500 hospitals while maintaining a presence in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nIt has also expanded its operations from moving only blood to other medical supplies like oxygen and blood products.\n\nThe startup has gained global recognition, with Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on the startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing [Lifebank] that needs to exist. If she can actually pull it off, she\u2019ll show a model that will impact not just Lagos, not just Nigeria, but countries all around the world.\u201d\n\nInfiuss\n\nWhile Cameroonian entrepreneur, Melissa Jane Bime, was in nursing school, a young girl at the hospital where she worked who had come down with malaria could not get a blood transfusion. She died as a result. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018. It multiplies very quickly, causing serious blood loss.\n\nBime would later ascertain that a hospital 20 minutes away had the right blood all along. That was all the motivation she needed.\n\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank. The startup is the recipient of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award and was the grand prize winner of the 2018 Anzisha Prize.\n\nDamu-Sasa\n\nAfter Nairobi\u2019s Westgate terror attack in 2013, the government appealed for blood donations to save survivors. And thousands of Kenyans turned up, but there was a problem. Although many people around the country were willing to donate, logistical challenges meant that only those in Nairobi could.\n\nThis led Francis Kilemi and Aaron Ogunde to create a solution that leverages technology to solve the problems of sourcing and donating blood.\n\nWith help from Kenya\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Authority, the startup piloted the project in Kenyatta Hospital in 2017. Since then, their reach has spread to over 100 hospitals across Kenya.\n\nDamu-Sasa is a Kenyan healthtech startup that works across the blood ecosystem. It connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\n\nRedbank\n\nRedbank homepage\n\nFounded in 2014 by Francis Adereti, Toluwanimi Adeyanju, and Tunde Ojediran, Redbank functions quite similarly to Lifebank.\n\nHowever, in addition to a mobile app, blood requests can be made via SMS and voice calls. The startup matches received requests with the appropriate blood banks. And according to the company, people can expect responses within 30 seconds of making their requests.\n\nUnlike other startups in the space, Redbank does not handle deliveries. It only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\n\nThe startup has increased its reach by striking partnerships with the Nigerian Red Cross Society and the Blood Bank Society of Nigeria.\n\nHaima Health Initiative\n\nHaima Health Initiative homepage\n\nBukola Bolarinwa is a lawyer and a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Young Leader Award. As a child, her parents often told her there were things she could not do. But it was not until she was older she learnt why \u2014 she had sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile in law school, she became friends with Nkechi Azinge, who would go on to found the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF). During this time, Bolarinwa volunteered at hospitals and discovered that sickle cell patients frequently needed blood transfusions.\n\nHowever, the hospitals often lacked sufficient blood. This led her to start Haima Health Initiative, which has evolved into an online voluntary blood donor register. It organises blood drives and educates people on the benefits of blood donation.\n\nWhile these startups are doing their part in ensuring that blood and blood products are available to those who need them, the success of their efforts depends on regular voluntary donors. According to WHO, 90% of people eligible to donate blood aren\u2019t doing so.\n\nResearch shows that one donated unit of blood can save up to three lives. We can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.\n\nHappy World Blood Donor Day.",
          "summary": "AdvertisementThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood.\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank.\nIt connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\nIt only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\nWe can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.",

Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has launched the Dash Me Store, an outfit of the Dash Me Foundation founded by the immediate past Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun.\n\nThe store is established to mobilise resources for onward distribution to vulnerable people in the society via grassroots charities.\n\nThe Vice President during the opening on Sunday said, \u201cI am excited to be here for several reasons, but most of all because of Mrs Adeosun\u2019s commitment to the notion that all service to man is actually service to God, and she took that very seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as Minister, she prioritized the Social Investment Programmes, when for the first time, the country voted almost N500B of our annual budget to welfare programmes which are called the Social Investment Programmes, which involved engaging 500,000 young men and women and also giving microcredit to about 2 million traders and also a home-grown school feeding programme for 9.5 million children daily in public schools across the country.\n\n\u201cI am therefore really not surprised that she has decided to use some of her enormous talent and influence to establish an organization that raises funds and provides resources for indigenous grassroots charities working with orphaned and vulnerable children, disadvantaged youth, and victims of domestic violence,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the establishment of Nigeria\u2019s first thrift-for-charity online store, Prof. Osinbajo said adding social enterprise to philanthropy with a structure that allows for resource mobilization for charity as well as creates the opportunity for people to earn a living in the process, should be the way to go.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is happening here is that philanthropy is not like it used to be when all you needed was a good and kind heart and you didn\u2019t need to plan or organize as you would a business for-profit\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, one of the factors responsible for the impactful implementation of the Social Investment Programmes of the Buhari administration over the years is the realization that \u201cyou can\u2019t reach Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d.\n\nHe said the realization has influenced the structure designed for the SIP and is largely responsible for the successes of the programme (which is now regarded as one of the biggest social welfare schemes in the continent).\n\n\u201cWhat Kemi and her team have done is to bring the new notion of social enterprise to this project. Philanthropy run with the discipline, attention to detail, and financial prudence of a successful business, and she can do all of that, and I am sure her team is imbibing that, given her background in finance in both the private and public sector.\n\n\u201cThe idea of this thrift-for-charity store is brilliant and the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a unique model which does not just give to the needy in the conventional way of merely handing out donations.\n\n\u201cIt is an innovative and structured way of aggregating donations to earn income to transform the lives of the vulnerable and needy while creating jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cI must say that your focus on funding grassroots charities is so crucial and I know that, having campaigned with you on behalf of our party, the APC all around Ogun and in every part of Nigeria, it is clear that you can\u2019t reach Nigeria and Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d, Osinbajo added.\n\nIn her response, the former Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun said the idea of the store is to aggregate donations of different kinds for charitable causes, noting that Nigerians from different fields of endeavour and from across the country would be enabled via the online store to contribute to supporting the needy in the society.\n\nShe said the organisation would work closely with charitable organisations in the grassroots to ensure that funds and other materials donated via the Dash Me Store get to actual beneficiaries",

They are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing. How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze described the President\u2019s comment as disastrous, noting that \u2018no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo\u2019.\n\nThe group stated that the silence of Northern leaders is proof that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria.\n\nIsiguzoro noted that Igbo people are emergency experts in all situations and will be a dot in the circle that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide had charged the leadership of the North to speak out against discrimination against Igbos and divisiveness being created by disastrous declarations of President Muhammadu Buhari describing how the southeast is landlocked and no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIt appears that there are chains of crafted skirmish programmed to either aggravate the traumas of Ndigbo or remind them of the sordid past a few years ago, and with \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 slogan that was used to pulverize Igbos during the Biafra war that left 3 million people dead, especially women and children. Right now in 160 days, 513 Igbos had been killed, 2,436 arrested and 854 missing in the ongoing \u2018imported\u2019 insecurity challenges in the southeast.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018dot in the circle\u2019 is a new signal to point out that Ndigbo are surrounded or should be taught in the language they should understand, but the fact remains that, the silence of Northern leaders shows that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria. We have seen the direction of events and Igbos are not noisy anymore, we are emergency experts in all situations, \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 remains the Bermuda triangular point that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some residents of Umuahia, Abia State and Owerri, Imo State, have told our correspondents that Nigerian soldiers now routinely arrest people, brand them members of IPOB, kill them and take their corpse away.\n\nAn Umuahia resident who did not want his name in print, narrated how soldiers intercepted a bus load of traders travelling from the Abia State capital last week, and killed all occupants of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cLast week, the Army stopped a bus carrying traders from Umuahia. They arrested all the occupants of the vehicle and wasted them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey arrest people, mostly young men everywhere and kill them. If they see a group of young men talking, they will arrest all of them.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, Imo State capital, the story in the same. Residents say people are still being arrested and taken away.\n\n\u201cThey (security agents) are still arresting people here and there,\u201d a resident told our correspondent on Monday. \u201cPeople are afraid to go out.

          "text": "Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government disclosed on Tuesday that it has received confirmation that about 3.92 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines will arrive Nigeria by the end of July or early August.\n\nSpeaking while addressing journalists in Abuja, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Faisal Shuaib, noted that the vaccines will be delivered through the COVAX facility.\n\nGiving a detailed update on the COVID-19 vaccine exercise, Shuaib said, \u201cWe now have information that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/Astrazeneca by the end of July or early August.\n\n\u201cAs we receive additional information on the exact dates in August, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of this.\n\n\u201cThe last time I spoke we were not certain about when the next batch of vaccines will be coming, but we have received official communication that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca by the end of July or early August.\n\n\u2018\u2019COVAX will only communicate when the vaccines are secured and our partners have validated that the vaccines have been secured\u2019\u2019.\n\nShuaib also disclosed that recent research from Public Health England (PHE) shows that the Indian (Delta) variant B.1.617.2 is 92% susceptible to Oxford/AstraZeneca.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore comforting to know that the vaccine used in Nigeria can protect against this variant that causes high morbidity and mortality in India. However, it underscores the need for us to ramp up our vaccination to more Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs you all are aware, hesitancy towards the second dose is very tied to the continued misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccination program globally and locally.\n\n\u201cThis is especially prevalent on social media. While I commend the patriotism of a multitude of our social media influencers, I must say that I profoundly appreciate the contributions our professional media community has been making towards the progress of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the challenge is upon us to go beyond straight news and do more in educating Nigerians through interpretative stories, promotional exclusives, features and special broadcast programs on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasise the need to be fully protected with the second dose, and the socio-economic and health risks of refusing to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nShuaib further reiterated on the recent concluded G7 summit as the World leaders addressed the issue of vaccine inequities supply particularly for developing countries to get the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWhile we are working with our international partners to confirm the next shipment of vaccines to Nigeria, I wish to speak about the G7 summit that occurred over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe topic of global inequities in the vaccine supply was a significant focus of the G7 meeting.\n\n\u201cRightfully so. Leaders of major, rich countries are becoming increasingly aligned with the thinking that the inequities cannot continue, not only because it is a moral failure but because it is strategically unwise for their own efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn the final day of the summit, leaders committed to delivering at least 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the world over the next year.\n\n\u201cWhile this will not close the enormous gap that exists today, it is a positive step and we welcome the new focus.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, President Biden announced on the eve of the summit that the US will purchase 500 million doses of the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine and donate them to low- and middle-income countries through the next year.\n\n\u201cThis pledge is by far the largest yet by one country. These doses will be distributed via Covax. We welcome this announcement and encourage other nations with the means to follow the US\u2019 example so that we, as a global community, can move forward from COVID-19 swiftly\u2019\u2019.",

Benson Babajimi (APC-Lagos) said the country was bedeviled by security challengevand secessionist agitations.\n\nHe said the worst was the lingering insurgency in the North East that had claimed so many lives and property and had cost the country a lot financially.\n\n\u201cThis must stop, the Armed forces of Nigeria must adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, my hope that the new COAS if confirmed will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs to bring this to an end.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that Nigeria needs a reinvigorated Armed Forces that is robust, well-trained, adequately equipped, efficient and fully motivated to protect Nigerians from the devastating effects of terrorism and other security challenges in the country,\u2019\u2019 he said.

Local production of hitherto imported products is beginning to gain grounds that I make bold to say that the materials produced locally can compete favorably with the imported ones.\n\n\u201cNigerians now proudly use products branded made-in-Nigeria. This development will no doubt attract several benefits to the country including increase in its Gross Domestic Product, generation of employment opportunities and reduction in the cost of production.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that the government was beginning to show more interest in and provide more assistance for local production in order to stimulate the expansion of local industry, noting that it was a 10% contributor to the GDP.\n\nMustapha tasked regulatory bodies with ensuring that local products met international standards.\n\nHe said, \u201cManufacturing is part of the economic sector in Nigeria that contributes approximately 10 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product each year. The production activity centres on the production of household goods, consumer products, agriculture, mining, cement, building materials, chemicals and so on.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that three sectors namely food & beverages, cement, and textile account for 77 per cent of the manufacturing output generating value in the country.\n\n\u201cThe government is beginning to show greater interest and provide more support for local production in order to encourage the growth of local industries.\n\n\u201cOur economic diversification strategy would rely heavily on the extent to which we create globally competitive products. Therefore, we have to take the issue of standards seriously and I implore all our standards regulatory agencies to provide all the necessary guidance to local producers to ensure they meet global standards.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the Minister of Industry Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, said that the purpose of the event was to promote local content and showcase Nigeria\u2019s rich cultural heritage.",

International Day of the African Child commemorates children killed protesting in Soweto in 1976. The day was first celebrated by the Organisation of the African Unity (now African Union, AU) in 1991. On 16 June 1976 in Soweto, South Africa, thousands of black school children took to the streets to protest about the inferior quality of their education and to demand their right to be taught in their own language.\n\n\u201cHundreds of them were killed and in the spaces of two weeks of protest, more than a hundred people were killed and a thousand more injured. To honour their courage and in memory of those killed, in 1991 the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union) established the Day of the African Child to draw attention to the plights of the African child today. The international day of the African Child also aims at creating awareness on the plights of the African children, with a call for an urgent need for improved and equal education space as well as encourages the culture of sharing something special with a child in Africa\u201d.\n\nHe further explained that in Nigeria, the Child Rights Act is the policy framework that exists to provide and protect the rights of a Nigerian child; and other related matters.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the domestication of this act in various states of the country, the wellbeing of children is not adequately protected as there are gaps in the implementation of the act. Current situation of out-of-school children in Nigeria, the Ministry of Education said the number of out-of-school children stands at 10.1 million. It is an increase of more than 3 million from last year, implying that out of school children figure in Nigeria as of June 2021 stands at 13.3million,\u201d he added.\n\nProgram Officer Education and Girl-Child Literacy Youthhub Africa, Mr Agboola Afees said that in 2003, the Child Rights Act was passed into law adding that presently only 25 states or so had domesticated it.\n\nAfees said the child right act in Nigerian was designed to address the triple issues of child labour, child abuse as well as out-of-school challenge.\n\nHe lamented that the remaining states yet to domesticate it were mainly from the north and the impediments included political issues and the fact that the Act was religious and culturally sensitive.\n\nSenior Programme Coordinator, Christian Aid, Mr Victor Arokoyo, said that not having the Act in place has adverse effects on children.\n\nArokoyo said that most public schools were bedevilled by dilapidated buildings with children in tattered clothes.\n\nHe added that the economic situation had forced many children into becoming providers, hawking to cater for families, adding that out of school children were poor kids who could not cope with education conditions.\n\nOn his part, a development activist, Mr. Emmanuel Tagwai said that in Kaduna State, NGOs gave technical support on the domestication of the Child Rights Act and carried children along in the journey of domestication.\n\nTagwai said that there was need for continued sensitisation and frequent mention of the Act and the need for the law to be fully domesticated and implemented.",

          "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo has refused to commit his future to Juventus ahead of Portugal\u2019s start to Euro 2020.\n\nRonaldo has a year left on his contract with the Italian giants, but that has not stopped intermediaries from assessing whether leading European clubs want to make a move for the Portugal captain.\n\nRonaldo is expected to decide his future after the European Championship. Speaking ahead of Portugal\u2019s opener against Hungary on Budapest on Tuesday, Ronaldo was asked about his club future and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been playing at a high level for 18 years, it doesn\u2019t even tickle me. If I were starting now, being 18 or 19 maybe, I wouldn\u2019t sleep thinking about my future.\n\n\u201cBut as you can calculate by now, at 36-years-old\u2026 whatever comes will be for the good, regardless of whether one stays or leaves, that\u2019s not the most important thing now. The focus is on the national team. A competition of this magnitude you don\u2019t play every day.\u201d\n\nRonaldo just completed his third season at Juve and helped the team win the Coppa Italia. The Turin giants missed out on the Serie A title and were eliminated by FC Porto in the round of 16 of the Champions League.\n\n\u201cThis is my fifth European Championship but for me it feels as though it\u2019s my first,\u201d Ronaldo said, with Portugal looking to defend the trophy they won in France in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for me is to start on the right foot tomorrow, to win and play well. Positive thinking. This is obviously not the same team as in 2016, it is a younger team with enormous potential.\n\n\u201cOnly competition will tell if we are better or worse.\u201d Ronaldo believes it\u2019s his ability to adapt to the changing of the game that has allowed him to continue to be successful. On a personal level, I\u2019m not the same player I was 18 years ago, 10 years ago or five years ago.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence of a football player is to adapt to the game. The game itself is different. Players who have longevity in football are those who can adapt. The numbers speak for themselves: I have adapted from 18 to 36. I always work to achieve things on a personal and collective level. I think the times have been very positive. I think I\u2019ve adapted very well to all the times I\u2019ve played.\u201d\n\nRonaldo, who scored 36 goals in 44 appearances for Juve this past season, goes into the tournament looking to break a few records. Should he hit the back of the net in this tournament, he will become the leading scorer in Euro finals as he is level on nine goals with France great Michel Platini.\n\nHe has made 55 appearances in European competition (qualifying phase and finals) with Portugal, with Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon having made a record 58 appearances. Ronaldo has also scored 104 goals in 175 appearances for Portugal, just five fewer than Iranian Ali Daei\u2019s all-time men\u2019s record of 109 international goals.\n\n\u201cThe most beautiful record would be to win the Euros twice in a row,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cThe team has been doing well, it\u2019s prepared. I hope that tomorrow the team goes on with the right foot, which is very important in this type of competition. We\u2019re going to play against a well-prepared team, who will have the support of the public in their stadium. It\u2019s important to have the fans.\u201d\n\nPortugal suffered a setback in their preparations for Tuesday\u2019s opener against Hungary. Coach Fernando Santos was forced to make a late change to the squad with Manchester United\u2019s Diogo Dalot, on loan at AC Milan, replacing Manchester City right-back Joao Cancelo, who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt was a shame that Joao tested positive, but we\u2019re not worried about that,\u201d Ronaldo added.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even talk about COVID-19. It\u2019s a subject that already tires everyone out. Unfortunately, we have to live with it. In my opinion this team is focused on the game. It will be the first European Championship for many of them. The rest does not affect this team.\u201d",

But Tuesday\u2019s opponents, the current World Cup holders, present a nightmare opener for Low\u2019s side on paper.\n\nThe pair faced one another twice in the inaugural Nations League tournament in 2018/19, with Germany earning a 0-0 draw on home soil, where they will face them on Tuesday at the Allianz Arena.\n\nThis will be the first time the two sides have ever met in the group stages of a major finals, with France clear favourites going into the match \u2013 a tag Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer does not buy into.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to start with a successful result,\u201d Neuer said. \u201cWe know we owe the fans something after the last tournament. We hope to excite them with the way we will play and we need their support.\n\n\u201cWe know France have been successful in the past years. But we are still a very good team, uncomfortable to play against. We have respect for them but we don\u2019t see ourselves as the underdogs. We want to win the game here in Munich.\u201d\n\nKarim Benzema and Antoine Griezmann are both fit for the game after they emerged from Les Bleus\u2019 final friendly win over Bulgaria last Tuesday with injuries \u2013 a dead leg for Benzema and a calf issue for Griezmann.\n\nGermany midfielder Leon Goretzka will miss the game as he continues to recover from a leg injury while Ilkay Gundogan and Toni Kroos played in the centre of midfield in the 7-1 friendly win over Latvia on 7 June.",
          "summary": "France vs Germany is one of the most anticipated matchups of the Euro 2020 group stage, and it could well be one of the games of the tournament.\nBut Tuesday\u2019s opponents, the current World Cup holders, present a nightmare opener for Low\u2019s side on paper.\n\u201cIt is very important to start with a successful result,\u201d Neuer said.\nWe hope to excite them with the way we will play and we need their support.\n\u201cWe know France have been successful in the past years.",

          "text": "Denmark\u2019s players have expressed dissatisfaction at the position they were put in after teammate Christian Eriksen\u2019s collapse during their Euro 2020 opener on Saturday, having to decide whether to finish the match that evening or the next morning.\n\nUEFA offered the players, who gathered in the dressing room after they witnessed Eriksen being treated on the pitch following a cardiac arrest, the choice of resuming the match on Saturday night or beginning again on Sunday at noon local time (11 a.m. BST, 6 a.m. ET).\n\n\u201cWe were put in a position which I personally don\u2019t think we should have been put in,\u201d Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel told reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt probably required that someone above us had said that it was not the time to make a decision and maybe should wait for the next day,\u201d he added.\n\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg also said Eriksen delivered a message via video link from the hospital to say that he is doing OK and that Denmark should try to focus on playing their next game, against Belgium on Thursday in Copenhagen.\n\nUEFA officials were not immediately available for comment. But European football\u2019s governing body wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the match would be restarted \u201cfollowing the request made by players of both teams.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had two options. None of the options were good. We took the least bad one. There were a lot of players that weren\u2019t able to play the match. They were elsewhere [mentally],\u201d Danish striker Martin Braithwaite said Monday.\n\n\u201cYou could have wished for a third option in this situation,\u201d he added.\n\nEriksen collapsed just before half-time and was taken to hospital after receiving CPR on the pitch. After a long suspension, the game resumed at 8:30 p.m. CET, and Finland went on to win 1-0.\n\nThe comments echoed criticism from former Danish internationals Peter Schmeichel and Michael Laudrup on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSomething terrible like that happens and UEFA gives the players an option to go out and play the game or come back at 1200 on Sunday. What kind of option is that?\u201d Peter Schmeichel, the father of Kasper, told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nUEFA said it had dealt with the matter as carefully as it could at the time, however.\n\n\u201cUEFA is sure it treated the matter with utmost respect for the sensitive situation and for the players,\u201d a statement said. \u201cIt was decided to restart the match only after the two teams requested to finish the game on the same evening.\n\n\u201cThe players\u2019 need for 48 hours\u2019 rest between matches eliminated other options.\u201d\n\nJonas Baer-Hoffman, general secretary of international players\u2019 union FIFPRO, said the decision should not have been made in the immediate aftermath of the incident.\n\n\u201cIt would have been better to cancel the game in that evening. Take a bit of time, take a breath, look at it with a bit more distance, look at what are the options to carry on with the game or not, and if the game can\u2019t be replayed then I think also that would not be very important in comparison to what happened there to Christian,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe players were probably not given a real option in terms of taking a good decision that was in that moment in balance with where they were mentally,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of lessons that need to be drawn from this,\u201d he said, adding that they would be conducting a review with UEFA.\n\nDenmark coach Kasper Hjulmand also said on Sunday that he did not think the players should have been back on the pitch.\n\nThe Danish Football Association said on Monday that the 29-year-old Eriksen remained in stable condition in a nearby hospital.",
