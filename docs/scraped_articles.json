          "text": "Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos, on Friday granted an application filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission seeking the return of a N20bn salary bail-out fund belonging to the Kogi State Government to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nFollowing the development, counsel to the EFCC, Kemi Pinheiro, SAN, sought to discontinue the matter in the suit marked FHC/L/ CS, 1086/2021, involving the salary bail-out loan.\n\nThe Sterling Bank account of Kogi State had earlier been frozen on the orders of the court sequel to an application by the commission which accused the state government of unlawful financial activity.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, Justice Tijani Ringim, a vacation judge, had ordered the freezing of the account, following an ex-parte application filed by the EFCC.\n\nThe EFCC, in a 13-paragraph affidavit in support of the ex-parte application, stated that it received credible and direct intelligence, which led to the tracing of the funds reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities in account No. 0073572696 domiciled in Sterling Bank Plc, with the name, Kogi State Salary Bailout Account.\n\nMoving the application for the interim forfeiture of the funds on August 31, 2021, counsel to the EFCC, A. Mohammed, urged the court to grant the order to prevent further dissipation of the funds in the account.\n\nMohammed also told Ringim that the N20bn loan meant to augment the salary payment and running cost of the government was kept in an interest-yielding account with the bank.\n\n\u201cInstead of using the money for the purpose it was meant for, Sterling Bank Plc, acting on the instruction of the Kogi State Government, transferred the money from the loan account and placed it in a fixed deposit account,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nHe further told the court that the bank had yet to present any credible evidence to show that the facility was well secured.\n\nAt the last adjourned sitting, counsel to the Kogi State Government, Prof Sam Eguro, SAN, told Justice Aneke, whom the matter was re-assigned to, that his client had filed processes against the interim order granted by Justice Ringim, and that the EFCC had equally filed a reply to the same.\n\nErogbo, had, therefore, told the court that he needed time to respond to the EFCC\u2019s counter-claim and also asked for a short date to hear his applications.\n\nIn his response, counsel to the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo, admitted being served with the processes and added that he had equally filed his counter.\n\nAt the resumed sitting on Friday, Pinheiro told the court that the management of Sterling Bank Plc, where the account number, 0063572696, with the name, Kogi State Salary Bail-out, was domiciled, had acknowledged the existence of the said account in its book, \u201cbut claimed the same was a mirror account.\u201d\n\nHe further told the court that the bank had clarified the questions leading to the commencement of the suit.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe sum of N19,333,333,333.36 is still standing in the credit of the account frozen, pursuant to the order of this honorable court,\u201d adding that \u201cthe management of Sterling Bank PIc, where account No. 0073572696 is domiciled has, pursuant to a letter dated 15 September 2021, signed by its Managing Director, indicated intention to return the total sum of N19,333,333,333.36 to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nA statement by the EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, titled, \u2018N20bn Kogi State Salary Bail-out Loan: Court grants EFCC\u2019s application,\u2019 quoted Justice Aneke as saying, \u201csince this is what they are asking for, the application is therefore granted as pleaded.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Victims narrate ceaseless police brutality, extortion, highhandedness -one year after #EndSARS protests",
          "text": "A year after the #EndSARS protests, it appears that the overzealousness of some cops against armless Nigerians have yet to stop, GODFREY GEORGE writes\n\nThirty-two-year-old teacher with a private school in Lagos, Yemi (pseudonym), didn\u2019t know he would be manhandled and extorted by some Nigerian cops. His offence was that he drove a Toyota Corolla Sports \u201907 car, and the police were not convinced he was the owner despite showing them documents as proof.\n\nHe had just finished from his daily extramural class that Wednesday evening and was on his way to buy a few groceries at a nearby mall when he was stopped by some uniform men dressed in black-on-black outfit and held Ak-47 rifles.\n\nYemi said, \u201cAs I pulled over, one of them shouted, \u2018Stop there! Bastard, I said stop there! Fraudster!\u2019 I was confused. They asked me who I was and I told them I was a teacher, showed them my identity card and some scripts which I took from the office to assess at home. One of them immediately slapped me and told me to sit on the floor. \u2018You dey speak English for me abi? I no blame you! You go hear am today!\u2019 he said. He told me that I was going to the station with them. It was around 7pm.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that after what seemed like an hour of harassment, his phones were seized from him and the policemen drove him to a spot around the Third Mainland Bridge from Toll Gate Bus Stop and told him to \u2018bail\u2019 himself.\n\n\u201cI was even more confused. I should bail myself? What did I do? I was bleeding from my mouth and nose. I was so scared, because they kept saying they would \u2018waste\u2019 me. I wanted everything to be over so I could be free. I had a young wife and a son who would be five months old in November so I didn\u2019t want to die. I gave them the N34, 000 I had in my car, but one said it was too small, that it was like I was mocking them,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe teacher said after showing them proof that it was all he had in the car, they agreed to accept it because he was \u2018a first time offender.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat was my offence? I kept asking myself in my mind. When did owning a car in this country become an offence?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\n\nHe further said that one of the armed men suggested they should give him N2, 000 to buy painkillers and laughed at him as they left him there helpless on the road at 10pm.\n\n\u201cOne thing that struck me was that before they ran away to join a nearby van stationed around the area, they identified themselves as \u2018CP Strikers Reformed Special Anti-Robbery Squad\u2019 and that was what made me bewildered. Was it not the same SARS that the Inspector General of Police disbanded in October last year during the #EndSARS protests? The thought that I would have been killed like a chicken for owning a car ran through my mind. I became scared.\u2019\u2019 Not long ago, a police killed an 18-year-old admission seeker in Lagos and some policemen extorted an undergraduate of the Lagos State University among other reported cases.\n\nIn Abuja, a similar fate befell another young Nigerian identified only as Ifeanyi when he was called by a friend who was involved in an accident in Kubwa area and needed help. Thirty-year-old Ifeanyi rushed out of his house at 11pm that Saturday and boarded a taxi to the accident scene when men suspected to be members of the Nigeria Police Force accosted and labelled him and the cab driver robbers.\n\n\u201cI explained to them what had happened. I even called my friend for them to speak to him, but the call did not connect. They searched the vehicle, turning everything upside down, but there was nothing incriminating. Then, all of a sudden, one told me to \u2018confess\u2019, so that I could go,\u201d Ifeanyi said.\n\nHe stated that after wasting time explaining that he had an emergency and not a robber, the men got angry and began to harass him.\n\n\u201cThey nearly stripped me and the taxi man naked and told us to \u2018confess.\u2019 They were armed with rifles, if not, I would have fought them. The cab driver was also helpless. I thank God it was late at night, because I don\u2019t want to begin to imagine the humiliation I would have gone through. In the end, I gave them the N10, 000 I was with. They emptied the cab driver\u2019s pockets and went away with what he had at gunpoint. They went with everything. As he drove me out of there, he was crying like a baby. Before we left, they said that if we dared report to anyone, they would look for us and \u2018waste\u2019 us,\u201d he added.\n\nThe #EndSARS protests\n\nFollowing different several rights violations by some cops over the years, with senseless brutality and mindless killings of innocent citizens, especially youths, Nigerian youths took to the streets on October 8, 2020, to protest against the acts. Their demand was simply\u2013 they demanded the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad; a unit in the Force.\n\nThe unit was founded in 1992 as one of the 14 units of the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, established to investigate people involved in crimes such as robbery, kidnapping and other violent crimes. They executed several undercover operations before they brazenly deviated from their goals.\n\nThey were accused of conducting illegal stop-and-searches, arrests, detentions, extra-judicial killings, sexual harassment of women and men, brutalisation and extortion of citizens. Some of these accusations were documented electronically in pictures and videos which only trended online and victims didn\u2019t get justice. The protests took place in many states in the South and were later hijacked by hoodlums in Lagos who vandalised government property and looted shops. The highpoint of the protests was the gathering of protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate area of the state where soldiers allegedly purportedly carried out shootings on some youths on October 20, 2021. The development later dovetailed into the setting up of panels of enquiry by some states in the South to hear cases of police brutality by victims.\n\nMore agonising tales\n\nLast week, in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, another young man who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of victimisation, said he was harassed, handcuffed and taken away by men with \u2018ARS\u2019 embossed on their uniforms.\n\nHe said he was on his way to his office and had his two iPhones with him and was asked to alight from the tricycle he was in and prove that he was not a fraudster.\n\n\u201cThey cuffed me, put me in their vehicle, drove a few meters and threatened to kill me. I maintained composure. When they saw I did not budge, they let me go. I was scared. I could have been killed. If anybody had told me that a year after the protest which many are still trying to recover from this kind of situation will continue, I will doubt it,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, in the same city, another young man who gave him name only as Edward said he was asked to pay N150, 000 to a third party account because the cops who stopped him and searched his phone saw SMS alerts from his domiciliary account.\n\n\u201cOne said, \u2018That is the account he uses to collect money from the United States. Internet fraudster!\u2019 I was unlucky because they took me to their station around 10.30 pm and tortured me. It is a long story. They forced me to transfer N150,000 around 2am and they took me to the roadside around 2.30 am and dumped me there. I was stranded, because I just moved to the city from Port Harcourt and was not familiar with the area,\u201d he said.\n\nAn Abia-based car dealer identified only as Victor said he had a nasty experience at the hands of some policemen who he said took him to their station and tortured him to confess to a crime he knew nothing about.\n\nVictor said, \u201cThey took me to their station, downloaded a whiteman\u2019s picture on my phone while in their custody and said I was into fraud. It was both amazing and scary. I saw them download the picture, and they asked me who the person in the picture was. They beat me and kept me in their cell for hours without any proper documentation of what I did or did not do.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that he had to pay them N50, 000 from the money he had in his account to secure his freedom.\n\nFor another young man who identified himself simply as Paul, he escaped death by a whisker as according to him, some policemen extorted him on his way to Anambra State from Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nPaul said he set out on a journey from Port Harcourt to Anambra and was on a 14-seater Rivers Transport Company bus when some cops stopped the vehicle, looked inside and pointed at him to show come down.\n\n\u201cIt was initially surprised on how the police would stop a passenger in a government-owned transport firm and begin to ask questions like the EFCC. I showed bus proof of my business, and that was my worst mistake. They told the bus driver to move and leave me since I didn\u2019t want to cooperate. The people in the bus had begun to shout, \u201cDriver, don\u2019t go! Dem go kill am! Don\u2019t go!\u201d I am grateful to the passengers. The cops threatened and I had to accede to their demand for money to let me go.\u2019\u2019\n\nOwerri, the Imo State capital, which has been a hotbed in the past few months, is not left out with cases of extortion by security agents reported by commercial buses and passengers.\n\nA 27-year-old businessman based in Owerri, who gave his name only as Nnamdi, said he met some cops on his way to Anambra State for a business appointment.\n\nHe added that the uniformed men stopped the commercial bus he was in and pointed at some young men to alight for a search.\n\n\u201cBefore they searched me, I told them to open their hand for me to see. They did and they conducted the search, \u2019\u2019 he stated. According to Nnamdi, they searched men on the bus.\n\n\u201cWhen they spotted a Lexus 350 jeep approaching, they corked their guns and faced the direction of the jeep and left us,\u201d he added.\n\nSome victims told Saturday PUNCH that they had been harassed by cops stationed around Owerri-Port Harcourt Road and inside Elele, a village in Port Harcourt, where drivers take to avoid traffic when leaving Port Harcourt for any state in the South-East.\n\n\u201cThey torment motorists and torment passengers on that axis,\u201d a victim who spoke on condition of anonymity source who did not want to be named told our correspondent.\n\nAnother victim who also spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity said, \u201cI have been harassed many times by cops at that Elele axis in Port Harcourt. The cops are still there.\u2019\u2019\n\nAbuja, the nation\u2019s capital, is not left out of the cops\u2019 highhandedness as two months ago, another victim who gave his name only as Mendy said he fell into the hands of the high-handed cops who apprehended him on his way home, humiliated him and extorted some undisclosed amount of money from him.\n\n\u201cI was dismayed when they portrayed me as a Yahoo boy few months back. I am a graphics designer so I strongly rejected their accusation and I got a deafening slap on my left ear for that. The ordeal has left me in trauma,\u2019\u2019 he said. The victims who spoke with Saturday PUNCH said they didn\u2019t bother reporting the cases to police stations or the commands to avoid intimidation since they couldn\u2019t identify the perpetrators.\n\nLawyers, psychologist, security experts lament situation\n\nCommenting on the development, a constitutional lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, said the entire Nigeria Police needed a total overhauling to enable states have state police and community policing as a centralised police force cannot cater for the needs of the citizens.\n\nHe said, \u201cPolice brutality has unfortunately become a norm in Nigeria. Whether in the form of SARS, which led to #EndSARS protests in October last year, or in the form of roadblocks extortion, illegal parade of suspects or extra judicial killings, the police remain the same. A leopard cannot change its spots. Call it SWAT, SARS, Rapid Response Squad, Operation Flush, etcetera, it remains the same.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the police needs total overhauling to enable states to have state police and community policing. A centralised behemoth Police Force such as we currently have under sections 214 and 215 of the 1999 Constitution cannot serve us well. It requires total rejigging. It constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to the provisions of the Constitution for police to brutalise citizens. The citizens can sue. NGOs should mount campaigns and advocacy, while lawyers should take up public interest litigation and class action.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother lawyer based in Rivers State, Selena Onuoha, said she was not surprised that nothing had changed a year after the #EndSARS protests as cops felt they had enormous powers being in possession of firearms.\n\nShe said, \u201cNo lesson has been learnt so far by the Nigerian government. I say this because of the way the issue was handled with the Nigerian Army claiming there was no shooting and no one was killed or injured. The change of name from \u2018SARS\u2019 to \u2018SWAT\u2019 was just to pacify the minds of the people because of the agitation. It was also a way of trying to calm the situation. But nothing changed. As a matter of fact, brutalisation, extortion and intimidation of the Nigerian citizens have continued as they were before the protests. The citizens are intimidated at every slightest opportunity by the Nigeria Police because the policemen are blinded by the authority they possess and move with the erroneous impression that the citizens involved would not and cannot do anything. These actions of the police are a breach of the fundamental rights of the citizens as well as criminal offences.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, a retired captain from the United States of America Army, Bishop Johnson, said it did not seem like anything has changed as most of the issues raised in the protest were still being played out in recent times.\n\n\u201cFrom every indication, as a Nigerian who plies Nigerian roads, it didn\u2019t seem to me like anything has changed since the #EndSARS protests. We have had cases of police officers, some who even call themselves Federal-SARS, are back on the streets. I think it is more like we are back to where we were before the #EndSARS protest. Most of the things the protesters were advocating against have not been addressed. I don\u2019t think the country has learnt any lessons.\n\nTracing the history of the Nigeria Police Force, he faulted the use of the word \u2018force\u2019 as part of its name.\n\nAccording to him, the use of force in policing is archaic and should be replaced with modern methods of policing.\n\nBishop said, \u201cIf you trace the history of the Nigerian police, it began during the colonial era. The duties of those colonial masters then were to use the police to suppress and malign the indigenous people of Nigeria, subjugate them into compliance with the dictates of the colonial masters. This explains why there is \u2018force\u2019 in the name of the Nigeria Police Force. They feel \u2018force\u2019 is the best way to police the people. Unfortunately, the use of force in policing is no longer in use now so there has to be a new culture. We would require some radical decisions and moves to be taken. The best way to address this now is to legislate on some of the practices that can be used in policing in Nigeria. If there is the political will to do so, it is not insurmountable.\u201d\n\nHe also suggested that the minimum requirement for recruitment into the Nigeria Police should be Ordinary National Diploma and that service in the Force should be made more attractive to attract best hands.\n\nHe added, \u201cYou have to make the profession more attractive like the other institutions such as the DSS, ICPC, EFCC, and others. A few good, smart and intelligent Nigerians want to join the police. To the extent it remains unattractive; you cannot attract the best hands for the job. Because crime has become more complex, so we need officers who have the broad mind to unravel criminal activities since the criminals have become more sophisticated, the minimum educational requirement for anyone to join the Nigeria Police Force should be, at least, OND so that they would use technology to fight crime.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother security expert, Jackson Lekan-Ojo, blamed the Inspector General of Police, Chairman of the Police Service Commission and Minister of Police Affairs for the level of decay in the nation\u2019s police, advising that everything should be done to avoid the \u2018second coming of #EndSARS.\u2019\n\nLekan-Ojo stated, \u201cThe #EndSARS protests nearly brought Nigeria on its knees a few years ago. If this almost brought the Nigerian economy to a standstill a year ago and gave Nigeria a bad image across the globe and we are having reports of ruthlessness by the same men again, then no lessons have been learnt. If they allow a second coming of #EndSARS, it would be uncontrollable, because this time, we are getting closer to the 2023 general elections and there are some disgruntled elements looking for any slight opportunity to cause destruction and mayhem.\u201d\n\nHe also faulted the recruitment prices, advising that there should be adequate profiling before admitting anyone into the Force. He added, \u201cYou must profile every prospective officer up to his family compound; you must know what he is like back home to know if he is qualified. Most importantly, the minimum educational requirements should be OND for the cops to be able to read and comprehend English properly.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor a behavioural psychologist and senior researcher, Remz Research and Consultancy, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Usen Essien, during recruitment into the police, psychological tests like history of drug use and its association with maladaptive behaviour was crucial as a \u201cpredictive of police officers\u201d behaviour during interaction with the public.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe psychological tests should include but not limited to history of drug use and current drug use. Drug use is associated with maladaptive behaviour and can cause accidental discharge.\u2019\u2019\n\nEssien further stated that armed officers must be tested and certified drug free before given firearms.\n\nAccording to Essien, the use of personality tests to ascertain which cop should be given firearms and one to be deployed to other units should be greatly considered.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe mental health status of any prospective cop must be properly checked and the current status ascertained. Candidates need to be checked if they have any undiagnosed mental health disorder including mood disorders. Prejudice- tribal, age group biases, social class biases as needless as they may seem will mean a lot to the armed cops when he has to deal with people who fit into his prejudice. They should possess impulse control, stress tolerance and emotional intelligence not to have troubling emotions and behaviours.\u2019\u2019\n\nStating that the process of recruitment ended with training, he said there ought to be training and re-training on how to use firearms and when not to use it. He said, \u201cThe training should focus on stress management and tolerance. This will help them deal with unarmed people irrespective of the provocation.\u201d\n\nState commands react\n\nThe spokesperson for the police in Edo State, SP Kontongs Bello, said all members of the disbanded SARS had been redeployed to other police units in Edo State to work as \u2018regular\u2019 police officers and anyone who had any complaint should tender it to the command.\n\nBello said, \u201cAll members of the disbanded SARS have been redeployed to other divisions. If anybody has any issue of manhandling and brutalisation, they should come forward, report and identify such officers. All members of the disbanded SARS for Edo State Command which I speak for, have been redeployed to divisions to do regular police work. There is no new unit. SWAT, as you should know, has not begun. There is not SWAT in Edo and there is no SWAT anywhere.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso, the Abia State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Geoffery Ogbonna, when told that police brutality was still ongoing despite SARS disbandment said, \u201cWhich one are members of the disbanded SARS? How will I believe what they are saying when they said they were victimised by members of the disbanded SARS? Where did they report it to? We have places where such cases can be reported other than the media. Refer those people to my office. Thank you.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Imo State Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Michael Abattam, noted that, \u201cSARS remained banned, but if anybody has a complaint, let that person come to the appropriate authorities with proof and let us know. Whoever is brutalised should let us know. SARS is banned and it remains banned!\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Rivers State Police Public Relations Officer, SP Omoni Nnamdi, said, \u201cARS? What should that mean? I don\u2019t know what ARS means. Those allegations are unfounded if they are not verified. I do not know, because no such report has got to me. It is enough to complain (to the media); they should lodge their complaints with the appropriate police authorities so action can be taken, because, as it is , what you are telling me now is new to me. However, I will still confirm if we can run into them. They might not be policemen, they may also be policemen. But let us do something to make sure the situation is arrested.\u201d\n\nOn her part, the Federal Capital Territory Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, said she was interested in getting to fish out \u2018those bad eggs\u2019 from the Force.\n\nAdeh said, \u201cI cannot confirm that these people met with police officers, but with this information that you have given me, I am going to investigate it. I will track them down and would really love it if your informant can see me in my office so I would be able to get more information and track those police officers down. If we can get all the details, we can track these people down to avoid further occurrences of victimisation of others.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for the police in Lagos, Adekunle Ajisebutu, said a message should be sent to him on WhatsApp for a proper response. He had yet to reply to the message as of press time.\n\nBesides, efforts to get the reaction of the Akwa Ibom State Police Command were abortive as its spokesperson, SP Odiko Macdon, neither picked his calls nor replied a text message sent to his mobile as of press time.\n\nAlso, the Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenganyia Anthony, could not be reached for a comment as of press time. He didn\u2019t pick his call or reply to a text messages sent to his phone.\n\nThe Force Spokesperson, Frank Mba, also didn\u2019t pick his calls nor reply to a text message sent to his mobile as of press time.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "RMD: I study, research every character I play",
          "text": "One of the most popular and well loved Nollywood actors and producers is Richard Mofe Damijo. Widely referred to as RMD, the 60-year-old trained lawyer had been in different spheres of life including administration of a public office as commissioner for Arts, culture and tourism in Delta State. In this brief interview with The Nation\u2019s Assistant Entertainment Editor, GBENGA BADA, the brilliant actor revealed how he studies and researches before embodying any character, playing the lead role of an established legal luminary in a series, Castle and Castle and how he interacts with colleagues amongst other issues.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most fascinating moment or experience for you on the set of Castle & Castle?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to capture that in a word or in a sentence. I\u2019ve said something like for me, it\u2019s the camaraderie, it\u2019s the fact that every time I am on set, it\u2019s my workplace, it\u2019s my happy place, so i try to make it as comfortable as possible, I try to make it fun, I try to make everybody that I have to work with be comfortable no matter how old or how young they are. I like to interact and I like to connect with people positively and once I can achieve that, it becomes my happy place and a place where I can always go back to every time or anytime that work calls me. You have to desire to be on a set so if there\u2019s no positive energy on that set, no matter how much they are paying you, you don\u2019t want to go back there. So for me, it\u2019s always about a nice collection of people, meeting friends, having a chance again to be and meeting with your friends whilst getting paid.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIf you were not on the film set, who would be your favourite character?\n\nI like my father-in-law\u2019s character in the series. He\u2019s a nutcase, he\u2019s such a typical Nigerian man, he\u2019s cantankerous, he\u2019s conniving, he\u2019s sly, he\u2019s loving all at the same time. And again, I love the character, Stella. You know, she brings to life and magic to what she does and of course, my wife, of course, that is like a constant, I love Dakore. People say I\u2019m a bit partial because she\u2019s like family to me.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs a trained lawyer, what extra flavours did you add to your character in Castle and Castle?\n\nA lawyer is like a doctor and it\u2019s about people running to you for help or to resolve crises in their lives or to make their lives better. What you do, what you pass off first and foremost as a lawyer is confidence, letting the person settle in his or her spirit that he or she has come to the right place. So, that is what I bring to the Castle and Castle series. I know what a lawyer\u2019s job is and so when I am acting as a lawyer behind all of that underlying that whole act is the fact that I really do know what I\u2019m supposed to bring to the table which is to say confidence. And so, I am also old school playing the character, you see the way he\u2019s dressed, how Professor Castle dresses is all very deliberate. He doesn\u2019t use a wristwatch, he uses an old vintage pocket watch, so when you see him, he\u2019s a fine gentleman with his bowtie, very distinguished, so when you come to him, you know if he tries to defend you or do something for you, if you even lose, it won\u2019t be lack of trying. So, that is what my profession did for me being a lawyer and acting that role out in Castle and Castle. You have to exude confidence, you have to make whoever is sitting in front of you feel like he or she has come to the right place. Being a trained lawyer did help and also knowing how the law can be tongue-twisting and how the use of words can be so difficult sometimes but because I know exactly what I am saying and I can relate with it, speaking those words or lines becomes easier. So, yes, there is definitely an advantage. So, how much of your background as a lawyer influenced the character, Tega Castle?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt just made me love the character more as he is somebody I can relate with. It made it easy to play Tega Castle. I have said earlier somewhere there are characters you play that can be very close to your person or personality. There are personality traits I share with Professor Castle. For him, the law is an instrument of change and pursuit of justice rather than self -aggrandisement or making you win the biggest lawsuits or deals with corporate bodies that have more money.\n\nWould you say the plot of Castle and Castle is real?\n\nOf course, even worse. Sometimes, people have said if you see reality and how weird reality can look, it\u2019s like a film. There are people\u2019s lives that are as entangled even if not more entangled than what Professor Castle and Mrs Castle lives are like. There are people, real life couples who work in the same firm today that probably have more entangled lives than Professor and Mrs Castle and what goes on in Castle and Castle as a law firm.\n\nWhat was your biggest challenge working on Castle & Castle?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTime management has always been an issue for me but I\u2019m glad that this season I saw a more efficient production. I love working with young people and there were a good number on set. It helps to draw from their energies and even learn from them.\n\nDo you have any strategic moves on being better than you were in previous appearances?\n\nI\u2019m a trained actor so being prepared for any role is key for me. I like not just to play my characters but to become them. I study and research until I\u2019m satisfied with the reflection of the character in me.\n\nHow do you manage the peculiarities of each actor on set?\n\nI expect nothing from anybody, so I deal with individuals as they present themselves. I love positive energies but even when around negative ones, I never allow that impact on the job I\u2019ve come on set to do.\n\nYou started out as a television series star before becoming a household name on the home video and film scene, which would you say you prefer?\n\nThey are the same, one is just a smaller box and the other is a wider box that\u2019s all. But I like TV because of the fact that it\u2019s a series. TV gives you more time to get to know your audience and for your audience to get to know you as opposed to a 90-minute or a one hour 20 minute film which is a one-off.\n\nWhat do you wish for people to be reminded of whenever your name is mentioned?\n\nI just do me. Professional, disciplined, courteous, respectful of other people\u2019s talents and respectful of the space and time of everyone I work with.\n\nSo, how do you then deal with people\u2019s expectations having been in the industry for over three decades?\n\nI just work hard at being the very best version of myself every day irrespective of people\u2019s expectations and I can only hope that my best version is good enough every day.\n\nLooking back at where you started from and now, how would you describe the metamorphosis of RMD over the years?\n\nI\u2019m basically the same actor. Age and experience have however made me a lot more methodological in my approach to characters.",

          "title": "2023: Where president comes from doesn\u2019t matter, says Bakare",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe founder of Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, on Friday met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, to dispense with what he said was in his heart.\n\nThis is even as he charged the National Assembly to improve on its record of quality legislation by working to achieve electronic voting.\n\nAccording to him, there is the need for the nation to adopt electronic voting to ensure that no Nigerian of eligible voting age including those in the Diaspora who remit $25 billion annually are disenfranchised.\n\nBakare, who was the running mate of the Buhari under the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in 2011, spoke to State House Correspondents after the meeting with President.\n\nOn the on-going debates over presidential power rotation, Bakare said the agitation is being fuelled by political immaturity, arguing that the debate ought to have bordered on the capacity and character of whoever will be allowed to lead the country.\n\n\u201cI said it on the 3rd of October. It\u2019s our immaturity, politically and otherwise, that makes us say power must either be in the North or be in the South, instead of looking for the best, the fittest, the most competent, and people of character, who love this nation.\n\n\u201cListen to me, if where the president comes from will make the place he has come from to be better, the Northern part of Nigeria should be richest and should be the most progressive and the most developed because out of 61 years, the north has produced either the president or heads of state for 40 to 41 years and yet, see the retrogression in the North.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s from the South, why should a person like President Obasanjo freeze and seize the account of Lagos State in his own tenure? If it\u2019s from South-South or South-East why couldn\u2019t President Jonathan use all his powers to develop South-South and the South-East?\n\n\u201cNot where they come from, it\u2019s what they carry and what they have to offer. May the best of the best of Nigerians rise, whether they\u2019re from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south.\n\n\u201cIf there are agreements between politicians among themselves on rotation, a bargain is a bargain. That\u2019s between them. But as far as this country is concerned, what we need at this stage is man who can drive us to the Eldorado\u201d, he said.\n\nThe cleric commended the National Assembly for approving electronic transmission of election results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), describing it as one of the best things the federal legislature had so far done.\n\nReacting to the recent approval for electronic transmission of election results, he said: \u201cPerhaps one of the best things the present National Assembly has done, especially the Senate, because with that, Nigerians can vote and then results can be transmitted so easily. Not only that, part of the State of the Nation address that I did on October 10, I emphasised how Nigeria youth, especially undergraduates, are disenfranchised in our country.\n\n\u201cI said 22.3 million students are registered, but during elections, campuses are shut, they will not be able to return there to vote, therefore disenfranchised. If we can do not just transmitting results, but to be able to vote electronically, that will be wonderful. It will deepen and enhance our democracy.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the Diaspora sends above $25 billion to Nigeria. Nigeria in Diaspora should also be able to vote like they do in every other country in the world. The more, the merrier. Yes, democracy is a game of numbers, but our people should have the final say. So, the office of the citizen must be as important, if not more than the office of the governor or the president because they are the people who put them in power. Sovereignty still lies in the hands of the people of Nigeria,\u201d, he said.\n\nThe cleric also said his call for restructuring of the country does not involve Balkanisation, but explained that a peaceful restructuring is possible, when justice, equity and the rule of law are allowed to take hold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019 said it, it\u2019s in the open, the documents are already there, it\u2019s not something I can cover in five minutes. We can do it without shooting any gun. The lecture after lecture after lecture, I have prepared and I\u2019ve made copies available to Mr President.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it, to move this nation forward. The founding fathers of this nation; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, alongside with their entourage, in Lancaster House and everywhere, agreed on what type of government Nigeria should have. We must not change the goalpost in the midst of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better off together as a nation than going our different ways. But it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and a rule of law\u201d, he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

It will be recalled that both brothers, who worked for the company of Prince Arthur Eze, while working for him as staff and earning fixed salaries, all of a sudden while still under the employment of Prince Arthur Eze, fraudulently and criminally acquired properties amounting to billions of naira in choice areas of some states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. This ugly discovery made their boss, Prince Arthur Eze to report the case to the EFCC, which promptly investigated the case and subsequently commenced prosecution of the two brothers. The court had earlier granted an interim forfeiture order to give room for the defendants to show reasons why a final forfeiture order should not be granted by the court.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nFormer Senate president, Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday, emerged consensus candidate of the North for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) national chairmanship.\n\nAdamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, announced it after a meeting of PDP northern caucus at the Bauchi Government in Abuja.\n\nFintiri, who is chairman of a panel set up by northern leaders to screen aspirants from the zone, said with Ayu\u2019s emergence, the North would reach out to party leaders in the South to sell his candidature.\n\nWhile the North Central nominated Ayu as its consensus candidate, North East and North West nominated former Senate leader, Abdul Ningi and former Kastina State governor, Ibrahim Shema, respectively.\n\nHowever, the Adamawa governor said although the three aspirants were qualified to lead the party, following intense discussion, northern leaders settled for Ayu.\n\n\u201cAll of them were immensely qualified but through discussion and reconciliation, we have emerged with consensus list that was endorsed by the candidates themselves. There was no election and there was no selection.\u201d\n\nAyu\u2019s emergence is the climax of days of intrigues and horse-trading among northern PDP stakeholders.\n\nThe former Senate president would be presented to the PDP National Convention holding in Abuja from October 30 to 31 for ratification as national chairman.\n\nA party source, who attended the meeting, told Daily Sun that \u201cat the meeting, Ningi withdrew from the contest as the North East pledged support for the North Central. When the North West discovered they cannot go alone, they equally supported Ayu.\u201d\n\nAyu, in a chat with journalists, said as chairman, he would run an inclusive administration and work with all leaders of the party across the country to return the PDP to power.\n\n\u201cThe PDP will be back to its winning ways. And we will work tirelessly after the convention to rebuild the party to take over power to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cI believe Nigerians want a PDP government. Our 16 years moved this country forward. We intend to work together with all the leaders, not only in the North, but across the country to reposition this country for the next generation of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt will be an all-inclusive administration of the party. We will work collectively to produce policies which will be acceptable Nigerians. Today, our currency is the weakest in the world. Even the Somalians are better than us in Africa. We will work hard to solve the issue of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Northern leaders, who are united, determined and who are willing to work with me. I am a foundation member of this party. I worked in the party before, but I know that you cannot do it alone. We shall work as team,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple sources said he emerged based on agreement that his adoption would not preclude anybody from any zone from contesting the Presidency.\n\nOne of the decisions reached at the meeting was that if the emergence of a presidential candidate tilt the scale in favour of any zone, the chairman would resign and work for the candidate.\n\n\u201cIt is after Ayu and the governors agreed to this that Shema and Nazif agreed to withdraw from the race.\u201d\n\nHe said Atiku played no role in all the negotiations and observed that it was only last weekend that both men spoke for the first time after many years of not communicating.\n\nMeanwhile, former minister of State for Education, Kenneth Gbagi, has said the PDP wwould win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nGbagi, governorship aspirant in Delta State, said Nigerians have seen the difference between the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC), and now know better where to cast their votes.\n\nHe said the country has deteriorated in the past six years under the APC-led Federal Government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nGbagi spoke at Oginibo in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State after his return from Ondo State where he was conferred with Aare Atunluse of Akure kingdom.\n\nThe former mnister is convinced that politicians defecting from PDP to APC were be coerced, adding that such persons remained PDP members who would work for the success of the party.\n\n\u201cAll the people running from PDP to APC are not APC members. They are PDP members in blood, soul and body, and they are all going to work for PDP.\n\n\u201cPDP is going to produce the next president in Nigeria. If you don\u2019t marry two wives, they say, you do not know which one is better. It is for you to marry two wives and see the difference.\n\n\u201cAnd you will have a situation in the next election where they, who thought they are forced by their own thinking to join APC, will be bearing APC in the day and at the night, they are PDP members,\u201d he said.\n\nThe security expert and renowned entrepreneur also said Nigeria would not disintegrate, and accused the Federal Government of being the problem of the country.\n\n\u201cIf there is any problem in Nigeria, it is the government. What ought to be beautiful, what ought to be the happiest thing of our life is our population.\n\n\u201cPopulation anywhere in the world is a money spinner, an economic driver, but all of that we are toiling with, hence we are where we are today,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cWe, as Nigerians, must correct immediately the situation before machineries or government of nations other than our nation come to correct it for us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a pressure group within the PDP, North Central PDP Rebirth Forum ( NCPDPRF) has rejected the emergence of Ayu as consensus chairmanship candidate.\n\nThe convener of the group, Mohammed Idah, in a statement, yesterday, stated that the former Senate President\u2019s adoption is part of alleged plan to exclude the North Central from the 2023 presidential contest..\n\n\u201cThe North Central has produced several PDP national Chairmen. For the avoidance of doubts, the Pioneer PDP chairman was Chief Solomon Lar from Plateau State, Engr. Barnabas Gemade and Chief Audu Ogbe were all PDP chairmen from Benue State.\n\n\u201cAhamdu Ali from Kogi state, Alhaji Kawu Baraje from kwara state also became chairman of our party without any benefit to the North Central. We totally reject the move to stop the North Central from aspiring for the Presidency in 2023 using any guise.

Another meeting later held last night, where the Bauchi Governor, Bala Mohammed, and others hinted that all the governors had decided on Ayu.\n\nAyu was also brought in to appeal and plead for support and he assured that he would ensure a level playing field, before eventually emerging consensus candidate.\n\nThe scheme began to unravel at the North-east meeting, when Nazif found out that the Bauchi governor had encouraged Senator Abdul Ningi to join the race in order to stop him. The plan was for them to pick Ningi over Nazif and get Ningi to withdraw for Ayu.\n\nBut when Nazif threatened he would contest, regardless, and Shema also sent a signal that he would not withdraw, Mohammed and the other governors realised their plot might fail except they begged other stakeholders. It was at this stage that they pleaded and persuaded Shema and Nazif to step down, which they accepted.\n\nHowever, after over three hours meeting at the Bauchi State Government Lodge, the Northern PDP stakeholders settled for Ayu as their consensus national chairman.\n\nFintiri, who is the chairman of the PDP national convention committee, said, \u201cThere is no vanquished, there no victor in this meeting. We all came out united\u2026\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senator Iyorcha Ayu has emerged consensus candidate of the north. With this, we are fully prepared; we are ready. We will be talking with our colleagues from other parts of the country, especially, the south that they see reasons for this consensus candidate and give us support during the 30 and 31 convention of PDP.\n\n\u201cAll of them were immensely qualified but through discussion and reconciliation, we have emerged with consensus list that was endorsed by the candidates themselves. There was no election and there was no selection.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Ayu said, \u201cIt is my singular honour to accept the accept the responsibilities, which has been put on my shoulders from the North. I believe that at the end of the day, it will not only be the North, but it will be all Nigerians. The PDP will be back to its winning ways. And we will work tirelessly after the convention to rebuild the party to take over power to rebuild the country.\u201d\n\nInsiders privy to the horse trading said Ayu emerged based on agreement and undertaking that he and the governors gave that his emergence would not preclude anybody from any zone from contesting the Presidency.\n\nIt was also agreed that if the emergence of a presidential candidate tilted the scale in favour of any zone, the chairman would have to resign and work for the candidate if such affected the equation.\n\nAlso, it was after Ayu and the governors agreed to this that Shema and Nazif agreed to withdraw from the race.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar played no role in all these.\n\nIn fact, the source said, \u201cIt is only last weekend that both men spoke for the first time after many years as they have been feuding for years. The governors made sure Atiku did not play a role.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has approved the extension of sale of nomination forms for national officers for the October 30 to 31 National Convention, from the earlier announced date of Friday, October 15, 2021 to Sunday, October 17, 2021\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary and Secretary, National Convention Publicity Sub-Committee of the party.\n\nConsequently, the last date for the submission of duly completed forms has also been extended from Saturday, October 16 to Tuesday, October 19, 2021.\n\nAccordingly, he said that the date for the Screening of aspirants for various national offices has also been adjusted to Wednesday, October 20, 2021, while Screening Appeals, to consider appeals arising from the Screening Exercise, is now scheduled for Saturday, October 23, 2021.\n\nPlease note that the date for the National Convention still remains Saturday October 30 \u2013 Sunday 31, 2021.\n\nAll aspirants, leaders, critical stakeholders and teeming members of our great party are by this statement guided accordingly, he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says terrorists not amassing around FCT, Niger\n\n*Explains military operations in Southeast\n\n*Confirms ISWAP leader, Abu Musab Al-Barnawi, is dead, denies Gumi working for the army\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe military authorities, yesterday, announced the killing of 250 bandits as well as arrest of 600 others terrorising the North West, as testament to some of the new security measures taken lately, especially, the shutting down of telecommunications services in that part of the country.\n\nThe military high command also refuted claims in some quarters that terrorist groups had begun to amass around Abuja and Niger State, even as it explained the current military operations in the South East, saying it has no discriminatory undertone.\n\nChief of Defense Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, who made these disclosure while featuring at a ministerial briefing put together by the Presidential Media Team at the State House, Abuja, said no fewer than 250 bandits had been killed following telecommunication blackout in parts of the Northwest region since September, this year.\n\nHe added that over 600 other bandits had been captured in the successful military operations facilitated by the interruption of the telephone and internet services in some states in the zone.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe are responsible for the security content in that regard, so to that extent, looking at the numbers, from the last report that I got on Monday, we have neutralised over 250 of the bandits, we have equally arrested well over 600 and because it is a continuous thing, the figures might also change.\u201d\n\nMilitary operations against the bandits were intensified with a sudden shutdown of the telecoms services in the Northwestern state of Zamfara early last month and it was extended to parts of Sokoto, Katsina, and Kaduna States, all in the Northwest zone.\n\nIrabor said the strategy has so far been helpful to the military\u2019s operations in that part of the country, including the rescue of kidnapped persons from various camps of the bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe shutdown will remain as long as it is necessary. The shutdown is more of a blessing than anything else. Telecommunication in the Northwest was shut down out of necessity. We have achieved successes within this period.\u201d\n\nWith the ongoing operations, the CDS said government\u2019s primary objective was to ensure the peace and wellbeing of every citizen.\n\n\u201cI will like to also indicate that the rescue operations have led to the rescue of many of those recruited by the bandits, which is also part and parcel of that action and is not limited to Zamfara State but it also extends to Sokoto and Katsina,\u201d Irabor explained.\n\nHe said the military was ready to scale up operations across the country, in view of the worrisome security situation, adding that a larger number of the bandits had been identified in the Northwest region.\n\n\u201cOf course, a few who are having inroads into the North-central, we are taking action, so that they do not spread beyond the known locations. But more seriously, a larger number of the bandits remain in the northwest.\n\n\u201cThe Primary objective of government is to ensure the peace and well-being of every citizen so, we undertake our operations and activities to ensure there is peace, development and the provision of amenities that aggregate to governance,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining why banditry attacks have remained relatively high, since the military launched major onslaught against them, he said, \u201cthey are essentially, where they are. That is the reason why we are pursuing them. But more seriously, a larger number of the bandits remain in the North West. Of course, a few who are having in-road into the North Central, we are taking action, so that they do not spread beyond the known locations. But let me tell you also that threat as it were, whether terrorism, banditry, or any form of criminality, are not confined to boundaries.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why when we speak to issues that have to do with national security, it is placed in context with our neighbours, because, if all is well in our home and all is not well with our neighbours, then, of course, we can\u2019t have peace. So, this is the reason why kineticism has become an approach in this regard.\n\n\u201cAnd for many of you who have been very close observers, I want you to know that there are greater interactions that we have with our neighbours and we do not also want to offset the good relations we have with our neighbours, because it is from the enlightened self-interest perspective that we would do that\u201d.\n\nIrabor, however, allayed the fears of a possible regrouping of suspected terrorists within the vicinity of Abuja and Niger State, describing the source of the said information as handiwork of mischief makers.\n\nThe Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, had on Wednesday, raised the alarm that it had intelligence from some sources that the terrorists had started setting up camps around the FCT and Niger State, calling for immediate action.\n\nBut Irabor described the claim as false and should be discountenanced forthwith, stating that many people pushing out information do so to \u2018fly agenda kites\u2019, adding that if there was anything as being claimed by those raising the alarm, the military would have known.\n\nHis words: \u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting, but can I please confirm to you that what we saw was social media reports raising some form of apprehension as to the presence of some alien individuals or criminal elements within the precincts of the FCT, to which we have taken measures to confirm or not and then in our efforts, we have seen that that the report is not true and besides, we have equally taken measures to ensure that should anyone be desiring or having an idea to do that, then that has not happened.\n\n\u201cOne thing you must understand is that by virtue of the current environment, climate, okay, technology climate, as it were, fear is being duplicated by various means and so, some individuals that have ideas, the only way they can sell the idea is by pushing it to the public, hoping that there will be an acceptance of that idea.\n\n\u201cSo, if the security agencies are oblivious about certain\u2026 of course they get hoodwinked and then, of course, lose focus. So, for you as members of the press, you must have also come to terms with that reality, that sometimes you\u2019ll find that many of these reports have an intended aim, an intended purpose and so the narrative has to be created to make it fit into that purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is why sometimes some people have to have a rebuttal, some have to say actually, this news is fake and so on and so forth. But on this matter, it is not true. Is it true, it\u2019s not a true report\u201d.\n\nOn the alleged military brutality in the Southeast, Irabor said the perception of discriminatory military engagement against the people of the region was not correct.\n\nAddressing why the military chose to scale up operations in the Southeast, while bandits in the Northwest and Northcentral zones were considered for negotiations, and repentant terrorists in the Northeast were being rehabilitated, the Defence Chief emphasised that insecurity varies from region to region.\n\nHe explained that, what you find in the Southeast was different from what was obtainable in the North, adding that despite the military engagement in the Southeast, he had led discussions with people of the area.\n\nHe said while Nigerians have the right to pass their views to government, they must not do so through the use of violence, saying, \u201cif anyone thinks they can try the armed forces, let him try the shape of the armed forces.\u201d\n\nAlso, on the activities of the Muslim cleric, Sheikh Gumi, who had been leading negotiations with bandits, the CDS said Gumi did not work for the military but that the military would equally not prevent anyone from playing his part in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe said what was not acceptable to the military was when such persons work at cross-purposes with security agencies\u2019 objectives.\n\nAsked to confirm the news that the the leader of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), Abu Musab Al-Barnawi, was dead, the Defence boss said, \u201cI can authoritatively confirm to you that Abu Musab is dead. As simple as that. He is dead and remains dead.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "He added that over 600 other bandits had been captured in the successful military operations facilitated by the interruption of the telephone and internet services in some states in the zone.\nWe have achieved successes within this period.\u201dWith the ongoing operations, the CDS said government\u2019s primary objective was to ensure the peace and wellbeing of every citizen.\nBut more seriously, a larger number of the bandits remain in the northwest.\n\u201cSo, if the security agencies are oblivious about certain\u2026 of course they get hoodwinked and then, of course, lose focus.\nHe said what was not acceptable to the military was when such persons work at cross-purposes with security agencies\u2019 objectives.",

          "title": "Emefiele: Nigeria Spends 40% of FX on Importation of Petrol, Others",
          "text": "*Hinges floating the naira on Dangote Refinery, petrochemical plant coming on stream\n\n*Assures foreign investors of prioritised settlement\n\nObinna Chima\n\nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday lamented that the country spends almost 40 per cent of its scarce foreign exchange (FX) on the importation of petroleum products as well as petrochemicals, which continues to put pressure on the naira exchange rate.\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing on the sidelines of the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank annual meetings in Washington DC, Emefiele, however, expressed optimism that once the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Plant commence operations around July next year, the country would be in a position to be able to save 40 per cent of the FX it spends on the importation of petroleum products as well as petrochemicals.\n\nThis, he also pointed out would put the central bank in a better position to float the naira.\n\n\u201cOn the Dangote Refinery, by the time it begins production latest July next year, it is going to be a major source to save forex for Nigeria. Right now, the overall forex we spend on imported items, the importation of petroleum products consumes close to 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cBy the time you add diesel, aviation fuel, petrol and the rest of that which makes up the 30 per cent, the Dangote Refinery has the capacity to produce 650,000 barrels per day. There is a domestic component that is about 455,000 barrels. Even if the 455,000 is what is sold to Dangote in naira alone, it is going to be a major forex savings for Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nResponding to a question, the CBN governor revealed that the total cost of the Dangote Refinery project was about $17.5 billion and the total equity from the Dangote Group in the project was $9 billion.\n\nSo, less than $9 billion was contributed by a combination of foreign and local banks and the CBN, he disclosed.\n\n\u201cSo, you are looking at a transaction where the leverage is almost one-to-one. We think that is going to be a major FX saver for our country and we would export those refined products.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the cost of freight alone, it is a major saving for Nigeria. That is because if we have to go to Europe or other parts of the world to bring in petroleum products where we pay heavily in freight and in stocking those products in the high sea before we offload them, Nigerians would benefit a lot from the Dangote Refinery,\u201d he added.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the project was one of Nigeria\u2019s backward integration programmes, saying the country was proud that it was coming to light.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we know that refineries abroad are already scared because they know the market they would lose because Nigeria will prefer to patronise Dangote Refinery instead of foreign refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cOn the petrochemical, it is also expected to commence about same period next. That petrochemical plant will be producing 900,000 tonnnes of polyethylene and polypropylene granules. Nigeria\u2019s annual consumption here is less than 200,000.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean? It is going to save five per cent of our imports. If you save five per cent of your imports and another 30 per cent in petroleum products and then in fertliser where we would save about two per cent of our imports, we are moving close to saving 40 per cent of the country\u2019s imports.\n\n\u201cBy that time, you will see what we would be doing when people talk about floating the naira, and then let\u2019s see how the currency will depreciate,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, Emefiele told foreign investors that the federal government ensures that any of its debts that is due was given utmost priority, particularly foreign debts.\n\n\u201cIt is like a first line charge. The Minister talks to me about it and we ensure that wherever we are going to find the dollar, we pay any of our debts, even before we service any obligation. That is the rule if is Nigeria\u2019s authentic sovereign debt,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Urges governors to be wary of multiple taxation\n\n*Says focus on areas of economic strength crucial\n\n*Fayemi, Obaseki, Sanwo-Olu, El-Rufai insist on state police\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, said the seizure of funds belonging to local governments in Lagos State by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2005 provided ample opportunity for Lagos to think like a sovereign state able to overcome its financial challenges. Osinbajo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said the capacity of the state to rethink its predicament at the time resulted in huge increase in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), which is today in the region of N45 billion.\n\nOsinbajo spoke in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, at an Economic and Investment summit the \u201cFountain Summit 2021,\u201d organised by the Governor Kayode Fayemi administration. The vice president appealed to governors of the federation to start making huge investments in areas they have comparative advantage to shore up their IGR and stop complete reliance on federal allocations for survival. He said the governors could grow investments without resorting to multiple taxation.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s suggestion came as Fayemi and Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, and Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State canvassed robust multi-level policing system in the country, to protect citizens and investments.\n\nThey insisted that preventing governors from taking charge of security was affecting investment, development, and wellbeing of the people adversely.\n\nTitled, \u201cInvestment attractiveness, and Economic Development: Lesson for the Sub-nationals,\u201d the summit, which was designed to proffer solutions to some socio-economic issues rattling the state, was also attended by the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, represented by his deputy, Lucky Ayedatiwa.\n\nOsinbajo, who was one of the panellists, stated that time had come for the chief executives of states to start thinking about how to grow their respective economies like a nation, by investing in the most appropriate ways in their areas of economic strength.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe attractiveness of investments to any state should be radical, because that is the revenue hub and determinant of how happy the people of any state will be in terms of economic development in relation to their standard of living.\n\n\u201cBut while trying to grow investments, we must be cautious of multiple taxation. It weighs down businesses. Ekiti is a business-friendly environment. Ekiti has also excelled in the aspect of ease of doing business. You have vast arable lands for agriculture.\n\n\u201cAlso, of recent, the government of Ekiti divested 76 per cent of shares in the Ikun Dairy farm for Promasidor for the production of 80,000 litres of milk daily. Let me say that Ekiti has a bigger economy than many Africa nations. The question we should ask ourselves is that if I were the landlord of this nation, how do we survive?\n\n\u201cDuring my time as a commissioner in Lagos, we started with N600 million monthly Internally Generated Revenue in 1999. The seizure of Lagos funds by President Olusegun Obasanjo made us to think like a sovereign state. Today, Lagos is making over N45 billion monthly.\n\n\u201cThe surest way forward is to deepen investments in the areas where Ekiti has comparative advantage. We should also make good investments in technology to grow the knowledge economy, which is education.\n\n\u201cLet me commend the foresightedness of the governor, Fayemi, to know that technology is the best way to go. I am even happy that the low in charges of the broadband airwave has already started attracting investments to Ekiti. What is in vogue now is that, well-trained people in technology are the game changers.\n\n\u201cI urge Ekiti to leverage on the value in education it has acquired to develop its investments. I believe Ekiti has not lost this value. It has to be fountain of the knowledge economy, not just the fountain of knowledge.\n\n\u201cThe Afe Babalola University multisystem hospital in Ado Ekiti is now being mentioned internationally. It has made breakthroughs in neurosurgical, surgical, plastic surgery and many other areas of medicine. Many countries don\u2019t have such facility.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the lingering security crisis that was gradually crippling the economy, Fayemi insisted that a multi-level policing system remained the best way out.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis request does not mean abrogation of the central police. If you have problem of security in Kaduna, Governor el-Rufai can easily take charge. My recent experience and many of our governors were not even palatable, where we wanted to procure drones and Mr President was with us on the issue, but the NSA refused us End User Certificate, though we got it one year after.\n\n\u201cAs of now, security is on the Exclusive List. Even if the federal government is ready to allow us procure some arms, we have to sign MoU with the Nigerian Air Force. We have to work together collaboratively, because investors consider security as number one in any state.\u201d\n\nFayemi stated that his government had signed a bill into law establishing Ekiti Economic Council to plan and implement the summit and ensure that the outcome outlives his administration.\n\nOn how to cut cost in governance, Fayemi said the COVID-19 pandemic had helped in no small measure, saying the dwindling revenues to states has also taught a lesson that governors must block leakages in revenue collection and leverage on areas, where they could get support from the federal government, especially, the social intervention programmes.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor said he had completed many of the projects left behind by former Governor Ayodele Fayose, saying abandonment on the basis of lack of interest and change of party constitutes great impediment to growth and development.\n\nSupporting the call for state police, Obaseki said the police should be removed from the exclusive list for states\u2019 chief executives to be in firm control.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIf you have a businesses, you have to protect them and you must have the apparatuses. Security is on the exclusive list and we are looking up to the federal government to remove for states to take charge.\n\n\u201cWe must provide facilities for the police to be able to train our local vigilantes, because in Edo State, that was what we did. We raised a vigilante group to police our villages from kidnappers and other criminals.\u201d\n\nOn the role of ICT in driving economy at the subnational level, Obaseki advised that states should use ICT to recast primary education results, by making the children at their tender age to perceive computer as part of their lives.\n\nThe Edo State governor commended Fayemi\u2019s transformation agenda in Ekiti State, saying the state is lucky to have a resourceful and innovative chief executive that could turn things around with lean resources.\n\nDoing a holistic appraisal of the projects executed by Fayemi, he said he was stunned by the quantum of projects executed in water and other sectors, despite the COVID-19 challenge and the lean allocation accruing to Ekiti internally and from the federation accounts.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cEkiti is lucky, you don\u2019t know how lucky you are to have the kind of governor God has given you. Ekiti is not a big state. You are not even rich, but you have the greatest resource any nation can have, which is human resource.\n\n\u201cGovernor Fayemi is not only leading Ekiti people well, he is leading all the governors well as the chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 forum.\n\nLending his voice to the issue of state police, the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said, \u201cWhen you have investments, you would have to protect them and take responsibility for whatever happens. The investors will rely on the governors for protection and it is sad that we are not in charge. This is the area, where the federal government must look into the issue of state police.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu suggested how Ekiti could transform its IGR and break the challenge of sole reliance on federal allocation, saying Lagos State now makes between N45 and N48 billion monthly from the paltry N600 million realised in 1999.\n\nThe Lagos State governor suggested that the state should digitalise its revenue collection process and give staff in the state Internal Revenue Service incentives to do their jobs without perpetrating corruption.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cYou must have robust technology and ensure people don\u2019t collect money with hands. Make sure your money is centrally collected. Also, block all loopholes, encourage your staff by giving them small bonuses, so that they can deliver more. Ekiti has the potential to think like a country.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai described security as a big problem that every Nigerian should be concerned about.\n\nThe Kaduna State governor said, \u201cWe have 150,000 personnel in the Nigerian army. Police was 400,000 by the time this government came on board, but it has gone down to 300,000 now. We need multi-level police. Policing is local, just like a unitary environment like Britain.\n\n\u201cKaduna State is about 46,000 square kilometres in size. Boko Haram has been chased from North-east by ISWAP and now occupying the North-west. But if they are dislodged here, where would they go? This is why we should all be concerned.\u201d\n\nHe added that the country must decentralise the power of National Judicial Council to determine the number of judges a state could have.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo country can develop beyond the level of its civil service, you must appoint the right civil servants and we just give way for younger people to take Nigeria to the next level.\n\n\u201cI have just appointed the youngest chief executive of any agency in Nigeria, a 28-year old to be in charge of Kaduna State Investment Promotion Agency.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has filed a lawsuit against Chief Superintendent of Police, Altine Hyelhira Daniel who shot at him while he was protesting to demand an end to insecurity in the country.\n\nThis was made known by the activist on his Facebook page on Friday.\n\nHe added that he also filed a lawsuit against the Divisional Police Officer of the Federal Secretariat Police Station who illegally arrested him while attending the trial of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cOn May 31st 2021 a Nigeria Police Force officer CSP Altine Hyelhira Daniel directed by the Muhammadu Buhari regime, shot me at close range with a riot gun at the Unity Fountain in Abuja, soon as she carried out the dastardly act she ran away with the RRS police contingent under her command.\n\n\u201dToday, I took a decision for the sake of posterity to file a lawsuit against her and the police authorities at the Federal High Court in Abuja!\n\n\"Also, on July 26th 2021, another police officer, the Divisional Police Officer of the Federal Secretariat Police Station and his Divisional Crime Officer violently arrested me while pointing a gun at me for attending Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s trial at the Federal High Court in Abuja. These police officers must be brought to justice or justice brought to them! #RevolutionNow\u201d\n\nIn May, Sowore alongside some other peaceful protesters had gathered at the Unity Fountain, Abuja.

          "text": "Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has filed a lawsuit against Chief Superintendent of Police, Altine Hyelhira Daniel who shot at him while he was protesting to demand an end to insecurity in the country.\n\nThis was made known by the activist on his Facebook page on Friday.\n\nHe added that he also filed a lawsuit against the Divisional Police Officer of the Federal Secretariat Police Station who illegally arrested him while attending the trial of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cOn May 31st 2021 a Nigeria Police Force officer CSP Altine Hyelhira Daniel directed by the Muhammadu Buhari regime, shot me at close range with a riot gun at the Unity Fountain in Abuja, soon as she carried out the dastardly act she ran away with the RRS police contingent under her command.\n\n\u201dToday, I took a decision for the sake of posterity to file a lawsuit against her and the police authorities at the Federal High Court in Abuja!\n\n\"Also, on July 26th 2021, another police officer, the Divisional Police Officer of the Federal Secretariat Police Station and his Divisional Crime Officer violently arrested me while pointing a gun at me for attending Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s trial at the Federal High Court in Abuja. These police officers must be brought to justice or justice brought to them! #RevolutionNow\u201d\n\nIn May, Sowore alongside some other peaceful protesters had gathered at the Unity Fountain, Abuja. But he was shot by Daniel.

Sowore was said to have been rushed to an undisclosed hospital.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, immediately described the action of the police officers as barbaric.\n\nThe lawyer said Buhari\u2019s administration had declared war on the civic space.\n\nHe said, \u201cOmoyele Sowore has just been shot by a female police officer at the Unity Fountain in Abuja. He is being taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cThe officer fired a tear gas canister directly at his right thigh. Sowore was specifically targeted. The criminal officer is said to be CSP Altine. I watched Sowore being shot live on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThis is what Nigeria has been turned into under Buhari. They've declared war on the Civic Space. The FCT Police Commissioner has fenced the Unity Fountain with iron and cables to prevent protests.\n\n\u201cThis is a criminal offence under the Anti-Torture Act of 2017.\u201d\n\nAlso, on July 26, Sowore who was at the Federal High Court in Abuja for the trial of Nnamdi Kanu was illegally arrested.\n\nSowore, along with many journalists and others, who had hoped to attend the proceedings was denied entry into the court premises.\n\nHe said at the time, \u201cI have just been arrested by the Nigerian Police at the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cSubjected to beatings by police officers and take to the Federal Secretariat police station.\u201d",

          "text": "A civil society organisation, the Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), has stated that Nigerians are yet to see the government implement the recommendations of the various State Judicial panels of inquiry one year after the nationwide EndSARS protests which exposed police brutality and excesses.\n\nThe organisation also condemned the continuous ban of protests across the country by the Nigeria Police Force. RULAAC said despite the various brutalities by security agents during the 2020 EndSARS protest, the government as well as the police were still on the move to stop peaceful protests and gatherings.\n\nIt accused the government of moving from denials to partial admission and attempts to cover up the truth regarding the incident of the October, 20, 2020, Lekki Tollgate shooting by officers of the Nigerian Army on peaceful protesters.\n\nRULAAC maintained that the government should enforce various recommendations of the state Judicial Panels of Inquiry looking into cases of all forms of police brutality and extra-judicial killing in each state.\n\nThe Executive Director, Okechukwu Nwanguma, stated these in a statement obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nThe organisation said, \u201cIt was expected that the EndSARS protests would propel the government to see the need to urgently initiate a comprehensive police reform programme to address the challenges and gaps that allowed the egregious misconducts that triggered the EndSARS protests.\n\n\"We recall that barely one month before the commencement of the EndSARS protests across the country, President Buhari had signed into law the new Police Act 2020 which provides a framework to commence genuine and far reaching police reform. From compromised recruitment process, to poor training (including dilapidated training institutions and poor training curriculum) to inadequate funding and poor welfare conditions which make the police work force prone to corruption and violence.\n\n\u201cThe new Police Act has elaborate provisions for due process safeguards and how police officers should exercise their powers. We recall also that the IGP and the federal government acceded to the 5-Point Demands presented by the EndSARS protesters and affirmed that the demands were genuine concerns and will be addressed by the Government. The IGP in response to the demands, dissolved the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), reaffirmed the constitutional rights of Nigerians to peaceful assembly and protests; affirmed the sanctity of life of every Nigerian and the role of the Police in protecting this right. Many State governments set up judicial panels of inquiry.\n\n\"However, in spite of these acknowledgments, the federal government, at the same time resorted to vile tactics to suppress the peaceful protests before it eventually deployed naked force to brutally quell the protests by dispatching soldiers to open fire on the assembly of unarmed and peaceful protesters leading to loss of lives and injuries.\n\n\"Security agencies commenced crackdown on the leaders and presumed sponsors of the EndSARS protests, arrested and detained some of them, seized the travel documents of some others and freezed the bank accounts of others.\n\n\"Police abuses remain widespread with police officers engaging in the same patterns of abuse that sparked EndSARS. The arrest and continued unlawful detention of Gloria Okorie by IRT and the refusal by the police to comply with Court orders to release her, the indictment of the former head of the IGP Intelligence Response Team, DSP Abba Kyari by the FBI for abuse of power and for lending his police authority and position to aid and abet international fraud and benefitting from the proceeds of crime are recent instances that illustrate how police abuse and the failure by police authorities and the government to stamp out impunity have continued one year after the EndSARS protests.\n\n\"Nigerians are waiting to see the government implement the recommendations of the various State Judicial panels of inquiry with regard to bringing perpetrators to account. That's one way the state will send a clear message that it will not condone human rights violations. It is one way to stamp out impunity for police abuses.\n\n\"The Nigeria Police must commit itself to the professional standards characteristic of Police in a democracy. The police must be the protectors of human rights and the rule of law and not predators and law breakers.\"",

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office suddenly felt much colder as the young man took in the departmental officer\u2019s words. His dream of being one of the foremost robotic engineers at a top university in the Francophone world seemed to have ended before it even began as he encountered an unexpected problem.\n\nHe had told everyone who cared to listen in Cameroon that he was going to the prestigious Toulouse III University \u2013 Paul Sabatier in France to study, and he had gathered enough resources to make it happen. After a tense five-hour flight and barely enough rest the previous night, he didn\u2019t understand what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, to be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t pay with cash Monsieur,\u201d the officer responded, \u201cYou have to deposit at the bank and make the payment electronically with your card.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling hopeful once more, he thanked the officer. He darted out of the office, making a beeline for the nearest bank, where he excitedly informed the cashier of his intentions and received another shocker.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a school certificate to open a student bank account and get a card.\u201d\n\nThe young man was at his wit\u2019s end. He couldn\u2019t register for his student certificate without paying with a bank card, which he couldn\u2019t get without his student certificate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault that he went to France with cash to pay his registration fees and tuition. After all, he\u2019d left French-speaking Africa, where barely 20% of the population had access to banking services, so that was the obvious option.\n\nThe young man in this story is Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, a neobank looking to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa. PaySika has just raised $350,000 pre-seed from Angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria to fund this mission.\n\nAlongside Stezen Bisselou-Nzengue, Co-founder and CEO, Nengwe is building PaySika on Francophone Africa\u2019s existing mobile money infrastructure. It offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on their favourite messaging apps. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nIts chatbot helps users open an account, request free physical and virtual debit cards, and make transfers with these messaging apps without having to download the PaySika app or use its website.\n\nWhile the registration requirements for neobanks in Nigeria, for example, implicitly require you to have a bank account already, PaySika requires the phone number associated with the widely used mobile money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission has given him the confidence of investors like Charles Edouard Bou\u00e9e (former CEO of Roland Berger), Benjamin Chemla (founder of Stuart), and several others.\n\nNengwe\u2019s Toulouse experience was four years ago, in 2017, before he and his co-founder knew how to build chatbots and financial services applications.\n\nAs he sat in the bank, not knowing what to do next, a sandy-haired middle-aged man with what looked like a never-ending smile walked into the bank with deliberately measured steps.\n\nLooking around and waving at some familiar faces, he spotted Nengwe, whose hands covered his face as he tried to calm himself down.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Nengwe as he got within earshot, his perpetual smile still in place masking his seriousness.\n\nNengwe glanced at him, unsure if trusting a stranger in a foreign country was his best move.\n\nRealising he didn\u2019t have much choice, Nengwe explained his situation as calmly as he could.\n\nWhat followed was the stuff of dreams, the kind Nengwe had before leaving Cameroon.\n\nThis stranger offered to pay his fees with his card and collect cash. Probably more surprising was the man\u2019s seeming familiarity with his story.\n\nThis man turned out to be one of Nengwe\u2019s professors at Upssitech, in Toulouse University.\n\nThis gut-wrenching episode was pretty much par for the course for Africans migrating to study in France. Bisselou-Nzengue, with whom he would later form a close bond, also had a similar experience after leaving his home country of Gabon.\n\n\u201cLater on, I helped some people by providing them with my card and had them give me cash back,\u201d Nengwe reveals.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick to state that this is not the case for students from Germany or even Asia; it happens to just people coming from Africa.\n\nA seed had been sown, albeit in unpleasant circumstances, and both men would begin thinking of ways to solve this problem, which they figured needed to be tackled at the roots. It was clear that they had to democratise access to cards and digital payments services in countries like Cameroon where, only 34% of its adults have a bank account, DR Congo (25%), and Gabon (58.5%), to mention a few.\n\nBuilding that first MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika\n\nAfter graduating in 2019, he quickly decided that working for a company was not for him and began to put his knowledge to good use, testing some of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI started my first company, MyMoney, a chatbot that connected to users\u2019 bank accounts and sent notifications. But it failed because of product-market fit. We started working on PaySika right after,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nBeing one of the most regulated globally, Africa\u2019s financial services sector is not kind to newbie fintechs with no track record, so building PaySika wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.\n\nExpectedly, the inexperienced entrepreneurs were in dire need of cash to build PaySika\u2019s first MVP.\n\n\u201cWe entered French Tech Tremplin, a startup competition organised by the French government to invest in high impact startups. We received $23,000 that helped us in part to build the MVP at the beginning. This plus friends and family, and our own savings, of course,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nAfrica might have a distinct lack of senior developers, and local startups struggle to keep them, but PaySika is rapidly securing the goodwill of talented senior developers who experienced similar problems when moving to Europe.\n\nNengwe also reveals that while fundraising, he and his co-founder surrounded themselves with investors who understand the fintech and banking spaces.\n\n\u201cI would say we were lucky because we were able to get an amazing network of business people that really helped us understand how this startup business works.\n\n\u201cWe have investors with a background in banking infrastructure. We have some who are CTOs, and some who are really good at hiring. We just surrounded ourselves with people who are knowledgeable about key topics that affect us.\u201d\n\nA fully-locked MVP gives Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue the confidence to look for mature angel investors. Some of whom would later join its just-concluded round. But despite this funding, a mammoth-sized issue remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe financial sector in francophone Africa is heavily regulated. So we started scouring through all the details and regulatory requirements. We then partnered with some financial institutions that will help us implement what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2020, Bisselou-Nzengue, COO of PaySika, decided to hone his business skills to complement his technical background. He made the necessary preparations and left for Grenoble Business School in France for a year-long MBA in international business.\n\nThe new business he\u2019s building with Nengwe needs refining, but they seem to be headed in a promising direction.\n\nWith free physical and virtual debit cards and a 1% transaction fee on transfers, the startup does not look like it will be making much money. Nonetheless, Nengwe believes they are taking baby steps.\n\nThough the startup is yet to launch fully, it already has over 20,000 pre-registrations, mainly (90%) made up of young people aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThis was gotten organically. We didn\u2019t do any sort of aggressive marketing to get people onboard. Just referrals from different people who are excited about what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThe future is within reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNengwe says he wants to make the PaySika customer onboarding process seamless enough to cater to people without mobile money accounts. Once it can get its banking licence, it plans to add a savings account service, which he believes would be a major cash cow.\n\n\u201cWe will innovate in the offline space, so our customers can also perform transactions offline. But definitely not USSD. We\u2019re also planning to hire more experienced developers and build a marketing team.\u201d\n\nPaySika has some interesting counterparts in Francophone Africa. Ivory Coast\u2019s Djamo is building a financial super app, and Julaya wants to help businesses reach the unbanked. Wave, a mobile money service provider, became the region\u2019s first Unicorn in September 2021.\n\nAs recently as last year, it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much attention being paid to French-speaking Africa, but that seems to be changing.\n\nFor Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue, their story with PaySika is just beginning, and we\u2019ll leave several blank pages to document what promises to be an interesting journey.\n\n*The conversations and narrative may not have happened exactly the way we told it. But everything was based on facts supplied by PaySika Co-founder, Roger Nengwe, and our research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola*, a 24-year-old female, believes sex is disgusting and painful. She has no desire for sex and finds it difficult to discuss this challenge with her parents and friends because she is wary of the possible stigmatisation.\n\n\u201cI was only five years old when I was sexually assaulted for the first time, and I\u2019ve been a victim of sexual assaults since then. Well, I guess it\u2019s normal now, because how else would you know you\u2019re a beautiful girl if you haven\u2019t been sexually assaulted? I\u2019m simply being sarcastic. But it hurts so much that I can\u2019t stop thinking about it,\u201d she tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), sexual health is more than just the absence of sickness, malfunction, or infirmity. It is a condition of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being associated with sexuality.\n\nSo even though Damilola shows no signs of illness or infection, she\u2019s sexually unhealthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual assault can lead to sexual dysfunction \u2014 a sexual health problem \u2014 but there are tech tools to make us feel safe.\n\nSexual health in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Shawn Fields on Unsplash\n\nWhile growing up, unintended pregnancies were commonplace. It was surprising to see young people deviate from the abstinence training they\u2019d received.\n\nThen again, maybe I was wrong to assume their parents or guardians taught them about abstinence.\n\nI\u2019m much older now, and unplanned pregnancies are still prevalent. And this makes me wonder why parents still fail to teach their children about sex or give sexual health tips and abstinence talks.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Gen Z or Millenial, you\u2019ll be familiar with adverse reproductive health outcomes like unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and high HIV infection rates.\n\nIsaac Ogal, a Sexual Health Advocate and Volunteer with the International Youth Alliance for Family Planning (IYAFP) in Uganda, says, \u201ctraditional, cultural, and religious barriers to sexual health continue to exist in Africa.\n\n\u201cAnd due to high illiteracy rates and limited access to technology, a very small number of Africans have access to and understand sexual health information.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, this explains why some African parents don\u2019t give their children the necessary sex education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, a study shows that access to and utilisation of youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services remains a significant challenge for the African youth, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.\n\nThe study also reveals that sub-Saharan African youth face numerous significant SRH challenges, including limited access to youth-friendly services (YFS) such as information on growth, unsafe abortion, gender-based violence, sexuality, and family planning.\n\nAccording to WHO, achieving our sexual health and well-being depend on our \u201caccess to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality, knowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity, ability to access sexual health care, living in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health.\u201d\n\nIn other words, sexual health issues occur when we lack access to sexual health information and education.\n\nSexual health issues are diverse, encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure.\n\nThey also include adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), endometriosis, and sexual dysfunction.\n\nHow is technology promoting sexual health?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola only realised her problem when she came across \u201cSexual Dysfunction\u201d on the Internet in July 2021. She noticed that one of the dysfunctions addressed her desire and pain disorders. And this prompted her to seek help, even though she was devastated at first.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my condition was huge. I knew I had a problem, but I didn\u2019t realise it required me to be deliberate and attentive. I assumed it would go in marriage. What an irony! Thanks to the Internet, I began asking questions and researching sexual dysfunction,\u201d she says.\n\nAccording to a study, healthcare is being increasingly delivered via digital channels such as the Internet, mobile phone messaging, social media, apps, voice, video messaging, and telemedicine.\n\nThis trend has been aided by the spread of mobile technology and rapid advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nInterestingly, the study also shows that digital communication channels provide widespread coverage, allow messages to be targeted to specific groups or individuals, and have the potential to improve the delivery of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information and support.\n\nConsequently, technology can help people in Africa access sexual health information since the continent\u2019s Internet population is rapidly increasing.\n\nOgal believes that technology significantly bridges the sexual health information gap, as many educated youths have smartphones connected to the Internet.\n\n\u201cHowever, people with sexual health issues are afraid of accessing these services because of the stigma associated with them in a society that is already historically and culturally biased,\u201d he says.\n\nBesides, we may face barriers to access sexual health services, such as concerns about confidentiality and privacy, high costs, insufficient transportation, and a scarcity of medical providers.\n\nAlso, living in remote or isolated areas can limit options because there may be no sexual health specialist available and no choice of a male or female doctor.\n\nHence, the use of telemedicine to increase access to sexual health information.\n\nTelemedicine makes use of information and communication technology to overcome geographical barriers and increase access to healthcare services.\n\nTechnological advancements are removing the stigma associated with seeking information on sexual health and related issues.\n\nWe discuss four tech tools that can help us improve our sex lives while avoiding stigma.\n\n1. Ask Without Shame (AWS)\n\nAsk Without Shame was founded by Ruth Nabembezi, who grew up in a Ugandan orphanage home.\n\nAfter Nabembezi\u2019s parents died of AIDS, her sister developed severe skin rashes, and fellow villagers assumed demons possessed her. Instead of taking her to a healthcare centre, they took her to a witch doctor\u2019s place, where she later died.\n\nFollowing her sister\u2019s death, Nabembezi was unhappy that people in Uganda not only lacked information about sex and sexual health but were not allowed to have such discussions. And that prompted her to start Ask Without Shame (AWS) in 2015.\n\nAWS is a non-profit organisation that uses mobile technology to deliver sexual health information from medical experts and counsellors to young people to dispel sexual myths and taboos, halt potential HIV transmissions, and prevent unwanted pregnancies in Africa.\n\nAsk Without Shame offers emergency sex education through an Android mobile app, WhatsApp, phone calls, and SMS. It puts sex education at the fingertips of young people aged between 12 and 35 without judgment or shame.\n\nIt also allows many users to disclose information that they are too embarrassed or afraid to reveal to others. The organisation claims it wants all African youth to have access to the sexuality information they need to make informed sexual decisions.\n\n2. Honey and Banana Connect\n\nAccording to a Guttmacher Institute fact sheet, 15.7 million of Nigeria\u2019s 45 million women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) want to avoid pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, 61,000 Nigerian women die each year from birth-related complications, abortions, or miscarriages. However, with better access to contraception information, most of these deaths can be avoided.\n\nHoney and Banana Connect claims it\u2019s helping to reduce this number through its call centre \u2014 which can be reached by dialling 55059 \u2014 that provides access to supportive, affordable, and high-quality family planning services.\n\nAfter calling 55059, you will be connected to live agents who will respond to all of your family planning, birth spacing, and contraceptive-related questions.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I dialled the code to learn more about what they do.\n\nA bot welcomed me before my call was transferred to one of their agents \u2014 whom I\u2019ll call Aramide \u2014 in under 10 seconds.\n\nAramide introduced herself, asked for my name, and wanted to know why I called.\n\nI told her I\u2019d had unprotected sex the previous night and was terrified because it was my first time.\n\nAnd without asking embarrassing questions or judging me, Aramide told me to get Postpill from a pharmacy close to me and use it. I ended the call after telling her my age and where I was calling from.\n\nTo learn more about Postpill, I redialed the code. As I\u2019d hoped, another agent answered; I\u2019ll call him Julius.\n\nJulius told me that the Postpill is an emergency contraception (EC) that prevents pregnancy if taken within 24 hours of having sex. Asked if I could use it before sex, Julius said, \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nAccording to studies, using emergency contraception before having unprotected sex may not provide the best long-term protection because sperm can live inside the body for up to five days after ejaculation.\n\nBecause these drugs only provide the most effective protection for three to five days after sex, having unprotected sex after taking EC means the sperm may outlast the medicine\u2019s most effective window.\n\nSo, taking Postpill after sex is more effective.\n\nFurthermore, he stated that the pill should be taken three times per month but not as regular birth control.\n\nAccording to Honey and Banana Call Centre, callers are guaranteed complete confidentiality and privacy.\n\nIn Nigeria, calls are free on all mobile networks except Glo.\n\n3. Blueheart\n\nBlueheart is a sex therapy app that provides access to sex therapy, helping users overcome sexual dysfunction and have healthy personal relationships.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Sachin Raoul (CEO), Blueheart uses guided audio sessions to help people regain their libido.\n\nRenowned sex therapist, Dr Katherine Hertlein, and Dr Laura Vowels, a specialist in libido and sex drive problems within relationships, provide the information on the app.\n\nBlueheart uses the Sensate Focus technique \u2014 a hybrid of exposure therapy and mindfulness. These methods are known for dealing with a wide range of issues, including sexual health issues.\n\nAvailable in text and audio, Blueheart encompasses thought sessions that focus on sexual fears and anxieties, body sessions that focus on developing a positive relationship with your body \u2014 alone and with a partner \u2014 and connection sessions that focus on communication.\n\n4. Scarleteen\n\nFounded in 1998 by Heather Corrina, Scarleteen answers sex-related questions in a straightforward yet friendly manner. The young-adult-friendly website discusses a wide range of topics such as anatomy, pregnancy and STI prevention, abortion, sexual orientation, and sexual pleasure.\n\nYoung adults can use the online resource to learn about their bodies and health. It\u2019s a place where they can get answers to questions they\u2019d be too embarrassed to ask someone in person.\n\nIt also offers a one-on-one live chat with trained volunteers, extensive articles, and a forum where visitors can talk with people dealing with similar adolescent issues.\n\nThe significance of sexual health cannot be overstated, as it allows people to control their reproductive health and emotional well-being in intimate relationships.\n\nSexual health is an essential component of living a happy life. And prioritising it can improve a person\u2019s emotional, physical, and mental well-being, as well as their intimate relationships.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The gigantic oil refinery being built in Lagos by Africa\u2019s richest man Aliko Dangote will save Nigeria from the shame of having to import refined petroleum products but it could also be a possible trigger for the floatation of the naira, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria said in Washington on Friday.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the World Bank/IMF meetings in the US capital, the Emefiele enumerated the litany of gains from the refinery which is expected to cut Nigeria\u2019s import bill by about 40 per cent when it begins operation before the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, \u201cby that time, you will see what we would be doing when people talk about floating the naira, and then let\u2019s see how the currency will depreciate.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the country currently spends about 40 percent of its dollar earnings on the importation of petroleum products, putting pressure on the local currency.\n\n\u201cBy the time the Dangote Refinery begins operation, it would be a major FX saving source for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: Dangote Refinery in talks with traders for loan \u2013 Reuters\n\n\u201cRight now, the overall forex we spend on imported items, the importation of petroleum products consumes close to 30 percent (by the time you add diesel, aviation fuel, petrol and the rest of that).\n\n\u201cThe Dangote Refinery has the capacity to produce 650,000 barrels per day. There is a domestic component that is about 455,000 barrels. Even if the 455,000 is what is sold to Dangote in naira alone, it is going to be major forex saving for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the cost of freight alone, it is a major saving for Nigeria. That is because if we have to go to Europe or other parts of the world to bring in petroleum products where we pay heavily in freight and in stocking those products in the high sea before we offload them, Nigerians would benefit a lot from the Dangote Refinery.\n\n\u201cThat project is one of Nigeria\u2019s backward integration programmes, and we are very proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank governor adds that the petrochemical unit of the Dangote Refinery would save the about five 5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s current import bill from the polyethene and polypropylene granules that it will be making plus another two percent from fertiliser.\n\nThe petrochemical plant will be producing 900,000 tonnes of polyethene and polypropylene granules to meet Nigeria\u2019s annual consumption of less than 200,000 with significant room for export.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt is going to save five per cent of our imports. If you save five percent of your imports and another 30 per cent on petroleum products and then on the fertiliser where we would save about two percent of our imports, we are moving close to saving 40 percent of the country\u2019s imports.\n\nThe refinery is a 650,000 barrels per day integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos. It is expected to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery and the world\u2019s biggest single-train facility, upon completion",

But if there is an agreement between the politicians to rotate power among themselves, that is between them, but as far as Nigeria is concerned, what we need at this stage, is men who can drive us to the Eldorado.\u201d\n\nBakare also reiterated his call for immediate restructuring of the country, commending the Nigerian Senate for approving the transmission of election results electronically.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have said it before, the documents are there, it is there for everyone to see and I have presented copies to the President.\n\n\u201cWe can do it without shooting any gun.

We must not change the goal post in the middle of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better-off together, as a nation, than going different ways but it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nOn his political ambition in 2023, Bakare said he was always interested in nation building.\n\n\u201cI am a nation builder and if God wants me to do that and the people of Nigeria will appreciate that, why not?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pastored the church for 23 three years and now I want to focus on nation building,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Seven months after it commenced operations, one of Nigeria\u2019s most equipped private healthcare providers, Evercare, is riding on the back of investment in quality service delivery to gain popularity among its increasing number of patients, Ayo Shonibare, the chief medical officer confirmed to BusinessDay.\n\nThe hospital sitting in the centre of Lagos highbrow Lekki is seeing a rise in demand for cutting-edge service from a mix of cash-paying and insured Nigerians, who might have otherwise taken their needs abroad,\n\nAccording to Shonibare, some of the 30,000 Nigerian patients who fly out annually for \u2018world-class\u2019 health services such as advanced cancer care and transplant surgery for various organs have been searching inwards for local substitutes.\n\nWhile the impact of forex shortage on the high cost of getting medical care abroad has made Evercare the go-to place, on the one hand, restrictions due to COVID-19 have also been supportive.\n\nTravel restrictions in top destinations of medical trips from Nigeria have made travelling a tasking exercise.\n\nAfter India was rocked by a dangerous variant that forced a surge in COVID-19 infections and death, travel restrictions were introduced, limiting regular health visits, Tayo Ojuri, managing partner at Aglow Aviation Support Services Limited explained, noting it has been the same for the United Arab Emirates and Europe.\n\nSome of these restrictions meant that even if a Nigerian patient was fully vaccinated here, testing and staying in quarantine was still necessary, deterring very sick people who cannot afford to isolate for weeks before seeing a doctor.\n\nShonibare says the hospital is aware of these needs and working to retain the confidence it has gained within its short while of existing in Nigeria.\n\nWith more than half of its bed capacity occupied, one of the things working for the hospital is how it has managed to pool multi-specialties and numerous health services under a roof.\n\nRead Also: \u2018Telemedicine will increase Nigerians access to premium healthcare\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s still uncommon in Nigeria\u2019s private medical practice for a facility to host nearly 40 subspecialists, all working full-time to deliver patient-centric care. And at their call are tools, including full imaging machines, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, mammography, dialysis, chemotherapy, physiotherapy and rehabilitation and laboratory.\n\n\u201cPatients require round-the-clock attention to ensure that they get the best clinical outcomes. So we are doing a lot in continuous training and education, changing people\u2019s mindset about patient-centric care,\u201d Shonibare said\n\n\u201cWhat we have also done is our pricing is discounted compared to our competitors. We want to improve access to as many people as possible. We are also putting processes in place to ensure that people follow guidelines to get the best for the patient\u201d\n\nManaged by TPG Capital, the Evercare Hospital is owned by Evercare Health Fund, comprised of some leading development finance institutions and other impact investors.\n\nIt is a part of the Evercare Group which operates across Africa and Asia, with a portfolio of 29 hospitals, 16 clinics, and more than 75 diagnostic centres.\n\nThe 165-bed multi-specialty private hospital touts itself as an institution resourced to function in a broad range of specialties from interventional cardiology to neonatal intensive care.\n\nIt\u2019s equipped with a 22-bed intensive care unit, possibly the largest in the nation, and 4 negative pressure Isolation Rooms, as well as a Spect CT scan.\n\nThis is a time when investors in local healthcare are clamouring for import duty waivers for medical equipment.\n\nSetting up specialist practices in Nigeria often requires importing diagnostic equipment that gulps high costs worsened by the volatile foreign exchange rate and import duty level.\n\nIndustry analysts say these are signs that Nigeria\u2019s ambition to cut a substantial part of the luxurious bill on medical tourism annually is realistic, although more effort has to go into widening access.\n\nFemi Olugbile, former health commissioner in Lagos says the government needs to design practical ways to multiply the number of Nigerians under the national health insurance scheme to expand access to care.\n\nAccording to Olugbile, leaving less than 10 percent of the entire population covered is a major challenge that can eventually affect the thriving of private healthcare investments such as Evercare.\n\n\u201cIt is a journey, not an event. It will just make people work harder to remove the access barrier so that all the people who actually need care can access it irrespective of the size of their pocket. And there will be more Evercares that can be run sustainably in different parts of the country,\u201d Olugbile said.",

We have only three points on our agenda \u2014 restructuring, restructuring and restructuring.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our Distinct Nationhood Agenda, DNA, is simple, it is RUN \u2014 Restructuring For United Nigeria \u2013 this is what I\u2019m set to advance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running and leading a movement called the New Nigeria Progressives Movement. We shall join forces with foreign countries, champion reintegration of diverse ethnic groups into true identity until every Nigeria is proud to say \u2018I\u2019m a Nigerian\u2019 and also spearhead the orientation of every Nigerian until a minimum of 50 million Nigerians can say \u2018no\u2019 to hypnotic democracy\n\nThe preacher described the 1999 Constitution is Nigeria\u2019s \u201cglorified death certificate,\u201d tracing the nation\u2019s socioeconomic and political challenges to a faulty political foundation, following the destruction of its original political structure by the military.\n\nHe reasoned that ethnic, religious and secessionist agitations in the East, West and North were indications that Nigeria was in dire need of restructuring.\n\nAccording to him, where the next President comes from is not of utmost importance.\n\nBakare said: \u201cI am fully persuaded that the 1999 constitution is nothing more than a glorified death certificate.\u201d\n\nAddressing President Buhari, he said: \u201cMr President, stop passing the buck to the National Assembly\u2026Tear down this inhibitive concoction of a constitution. Tear it down so that we can build a nation.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that those insisting on the 2023 elections before restructuring, \u201care putting the cart before horse.\u201d\n\nHe warned the President that unless he restructured the country before leaving office, \u201chistory will recall that you failed.\u201d",

So much has been covered and I\u2019m really delighted with the way we are going. We are going to have the support of the communities.\n\n\u201cThe contractors themselves have nominated a community representative that is working closely with our public affairs team in the manner to ensure that the right information is given to the communities.\n\n\u201cThe expectations are managed, and together we can work as partners to deliver this project without any hindrance. Everything is good and I\u2019m very delighted with the efforts so far.\u201d\n\nOn the role of staff of the company towards the successful completion of the rehabilitation works, Dikko said: \u201cProcedurally, we have set up our project management teams.

Governors of other States including Delta and Ebonyi at today\u2019s meeting also indicated that their reports would be submitted soon.\n\n\u201cFollowing deliberations on the recommendations of the panels, NEC agreed/resolved as follows, (and this applies to all the States and FCT that set up the panels):\n\n\u201cEach State, in collaboration with the Federal Government, shall establish modalities for the settlement of all monetary compensations awarded by the Panels. Already, as resolved by NEC, a number of states have set up Victims Compensation Funds, from which several victims have already received payments of sums awarded to them by the panels.\n\n\u201cCouncil directed State Governors to immediately forward copies of final reports of the panels to their Attorneys-General for prompt arraignment and prosecution of all indicted persons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhere incidents in the reports relate to matters of discipline, in addition to prosecution, NEC urged the Nigeria Police Force to take disciplinary action on the affected officers in line with the provisions of the Police Act 2020.\u201d\n\nIt further stated that \u201cNEC called on the leadership of the security agencies to ensure that persons recruited into arms-bearing security agencies undergo psychiatric evaluations and drug tests before enlistment and periodically after enlistment to ensure that the personnel is psychologically fit to carry live weapons and to identify behavioral tendencies that may require psycho-social interventions.\n\n\u201cPersonnel of the agencies dutifully observes Rules of Engagement in the discharge of their functions/duties around and within the civilian populace.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging the various initiatives introduced by the Federal Government to:\n\n\u201cstrengthen police accountability through the Police Service Commission, sustain improved funding and budgetary allocation to the Nigeria Police Force and other securities agencies, and the lifting of the ban on recruitment of police officers.\u201d\n\nNEC further urged the Federal Government to give priority to the general welfare of police officers and personnel of other security agencies.\n\nIn particular, it advocated the review of pension and gratuity of retired police officers and attainment of parity of remuneration by police officers with sister security agencies.\n\n\u201cUndertake a comprehensive assessment of all police stations across the country to ensure that they are fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cNigeria Police Force and other security agencies should deploy cutting-edge technology in the fight against crimes.\n\n\u201cNigeria Police Force to, in line with the mandatory training provisions of the Police Act 2020, prioritize training of Police Officers on procedures for the entrenchment of Human Rights Provisions guaranteed by the Constitution and on the professional handling of weapons.\n\n\u201cAll those detained by the Policeas a result of the EndSars protests are expeditiously processed with due regard to the principles of fair hearing.\n\n\u201cThe system established within the Nigeria Police Force for receipt and handling of complaints or petitions is strengthened, and all police officers on duty should be in police-approved uniform with their full names and force numbers boldly written for easy identification.\u201d\n\nHe said the states should, as resolved by NEC to \u201cproperly utilize and support the community policing programme of the Federal Government, with active collaborative efforts and participation of traditional rulers, elders, youths, vigilante groups, etc.;\n\n\u201cEstablish standing committees under States Ministries of Justice to address human rights violations on a continuous basis.\n\n\u201cTake measures aimed at flushing out miscreants squatting in uncompleted buildings, and other blackout spots that serve as hideouts for criminals.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the role of lawful peaceful protests in the advancement of public discourse under democratic governance, Akande said NEC strongly advised those planning public protests across the country to mark the anniversary of the #EndSARS, to consider other lawful alternative means of engagement.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the current security situation across the country and the possibility of such protests being hijacked by armed hoodlums and other opportunistic criminals to cause mayhem at such protest events and venues. Council, therefore, urges the organizers to reconsider their plan.\n\n\u201cNEC would also like to point out the various actions already taken by Federal and State Governments to address the grievances that led to the 2020 protests, including:\n\n\u201c the disbandment of SARS;broad police reforms;establishment of judicial panels of inquiries to investigate allegations of human rights violations by members of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies.\u201d\n\nOthers are \u201c recommendations of which panels are already at various stages of implementation including the setup of Victims Compensation Funds from which several victims have received payments of sums awarded to them by the panels; and prosecution of police personnel indicted by the panels.\n\n\u201cThese are commendable actions that ought to be taken to a logical conclusion in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\n\u201cOrganizers of the planned protests should explore the various channels of communication with governments at various levels to advance their positions and avert the breakdown of law and order that may result from such public protests,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "In receipt of reports from judicial panels of enquiry regarding reported police brutality against Nigerians, set up in 28 States of the Federation and FCT, the National Economic Council (NEC) has resolved that payment of compensation to victims should proceed with each State, in collaboration with the Federal Government, establishing the modalities for the settlement of all monetary compensations awarded by the panels.\n\nEqually, NEC, which is composed of all 36 State governors and representatives of the Federal Government, chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), also unanimously resolved to ensure the prosecution of personnel indicted by the panels.\n\nAccording to a statement by the media aide of the vice president, Laolu Akande, on Friday, he said the Council specifically directed States \u201cto immediately forward copies of final reports of the panels to their Attorneys-General for prompt arraignment and prosecution of all indicted persons.\n\n\u201cWhere incidents in the reports relate to matters of discipline, in addition to prosecution, NEC urged the Nigeria Police Force to take disciplinary action on the affected officers in line with the provisions of the Police Act 2020.\u201d\n\nAlso rising from the NEC meeting, members strongly advised those planning protests to mark the anniversary of the EndSARS protest, to reconsider the option in view of \u201ccurrent security situation across the country and the possibility of such protests being hijacked by armed hoodlums and other opportunistic criminals to cause mayhem at such protest events and venues.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAt its meeting, today, 15th October 2021, the National Economic Council (NEC/Council) received an update on the Reports of Judicial Panels of Inquiry into Allegations of Human Rights Violations against Members of Nigeria Police Force and other Security Agencies.\n\n\u201cIt may be recalled that following the October 2020 #EndSARS protests, which later transformed into violent demonstrations, in furtherance of resolution of NEC, twenty-eight (28) States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) (under the auspices of the National Human Rights Commission) had set up Judicial Panels/Commissions of Inquiry (Panels) to investigate allegations of violations of human rights levied against members of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies, especially members of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\n\u201cThe 28 States that set up these Panels were Abia, Adamawa, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, Ebonyi, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Imo, Kaduna, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Lagos, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Oyo, Plateau, Rivers, and Taraba.\n\n\u201cOut of the 28 States, 11 States (Abia, Ekiti, Enugu, Gombe, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Plateau, and Rivers) have submitted their final reports to Council; with Lagos, set to finalise its sittings on 19th October 2021, submitting an interim report. Governors of other States including Delta and Ebonyi at today\u2019s meeting also indicated that their reports would be submitted soon.\n\n\u201cFollowing deliberations on the recommendations of the panels, NEC agreed/resolved as follows, (and this applies to all the States and FCT that set up the panels):\n\n\u201cEach State, in collaboration with the Federal Government, shall establish modalities for the settlement of all monetary compensations awarded by the Panels. Already, as resolved by NEC, a number of states have set up Victims Compensation Funds, from which several victims have already received payments of sums awarded to them by the panels.\n\n\u201cCouncil directed State Governors to immediately forward copies of final reports of the panels to their Attorneys-General for prompt arraignment and prosecution of all indicted persons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhere incidents in the reports relate to matters of discipline, in addition to prosecution, NEC urged the Nigeria Police Force to take disciplinary action on the affected officers in line with the provisions of the Police Act 2020.\u201d\n\nIt further stated that \u201cNEC called on the leadership of the security agencies to ensure that persons recruited into arms-bearing security agencies undergo psychiatric evaluations and drug tests before enlistment and periodically after enlistment to ensure that the personnel is psychologically fit to carry live weapons and to identify behavioral tendencies that may require psycho-social interventions.\n\n\u201cPersonnel of the agencies dutifully observes Rules of Engagement in the discharge of their functions/duties around and within the civilian populace.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging the various initiatives introduced by the Federal Government to:\n\n\u201cstrengthen police accountability through the Police Service Commission, sustain improved funding and budgetary allocation to the Nigeria Police Force and other securities agencies, and the lifting of the ban on recruitment of police officers.\u201d\n\nNEC further urged the Federal Government to give priority to the general welfare of police officers and personnel of other security agencies.\n\nIn particular, it advocated the review of pension and gratuity of retired police officers and attainment of parity of remuneration by police officers with sister security agencies.\n\n\u201cUndertake a comprehensive assessment of all police stations across the country to ensure that they are fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cNigeria Police Force and other security agencies should deploy cutting-edge technology in the fight against crimes.\n\n\u201cNigeria Police Force to, in line with the mandatory training provisions of the Police Act 2020, prioritize training of Police Officers on procedures for the entrenchment of Human Rights Provisions guaranteed by the Constitution and on the professional handling of weapons.\n\n\u201cAll those detained by the Policeas a result of the EndSars protests are expeditiously processed with due regard to the principles of fair hearing.\n\n\u201cThe system established within the Nigeria Police Force for receipt and handling of complaints or petitions is strengthened, and all police officers on duty should be in police-approved uniform with their full names and force numbers boldly written for easy identification.\u201d\n\nHe said the states should, as resolved by NEC to \u201cproperly utilize and support the community policing programme of the Federal Government, with active collaborative efforts and participation of traditional rulers, elders, youths, vigilante groups, etc.;\n\n\u201cEstablish standing committees under States Ministries of Justice to address human rights violations on a continuous basis.\n\n\u201cTake measures aimed at flushing out miscreants squatting in uncompleted buildings, and other blackout spots that serve as hideouts for criminals.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the role of lawful peaceful protests in the advancement of public discourse under democratic governance, Akande said NEC strongly advised those planning public protests across the country to mark the anniversary of the #EndSARS, to consider other lawful alternative means of engagement.\n\n\u201cThis is because of the current security situation across the country and the possibility of such protests being hijacked by armed hoodlums and other opportunistic criminals to cause mayhem at such protest events and venues. Council, therefore, urges the organizers to reconsider their plan.\n\n\u201cNEC would also like to point out the various actions already taken by Federal and State Governments to address the grievances that led to the 2020 protests, including:\n\n\u201c the disbandment of SARS;broad police reforms;establishment of judicial panels of inquiries to investigate allegations of human rights violations by members of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies.\u201d\n\nOthers are \u201c recommendations of which panels are already at various stages of implementation including the setup of Victims Compensation Funds from which several victims have received payments of sums awarded to them by the panels; and prosecution of police personnel indicted by the panels.\n\n\u201cThese are commendable actions that ought to be taken to a logical conclusion in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\n\u201cOrganizers of the planned protests should explore the various channels of communication with governments at various levels to advance their positions and avert the breakdown of law and order that may result from such public protests,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The founder of Citadel Global Community Church (formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly), Pastor Tunde Bakare, has said that it does not matter where the next President comes from as long as the President can deliver good governance.\n\nThis is as he voiced his support for the electronic transmission of votes in the 2023 elections and subsequent ones, saying it will protect eligible voters from disenfranchisement.\n\nBakare said this on Friday after a private meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nBakare, who in 2011 was the running mate of Buhari on the platform of the Congress for Progressive Change, was scheduled for a 12-noon meeting with the President in his office.\n\nDespite his previous close political affiliation with Buhari, the clergyman had in recent times castigated his regime.\n\nSpeaking with State House Correspondents after the meeting, he said the visit was to \u201cdispense what was in my heart\u201d to the President.\n\nOn power rotation, Bakare stated, \u201cI had said it on October 3. It\u2019s our immaturity, politically and otherwise, that makes us say power must either be in the North or be in the South, instead of looking for the best, the fittest, the most competent, and people of character, who love this nation.\n\n\u201cListen to me, if where the president comes from will make the place he has come from to be better, the northern part of Nigeria should be the richest and should be the most progressive and the most developed because out of 61 years, the north has produced either the president or heads of state for 40 to 41 years, and yet see the retrogression in the North.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s from the South, why should a person like President Obasanjo freeze and seize the account of Lagos State in his own tenure? If it\u2019s from South-South or South-East why couldn\u2019t President Jonathan use all his powers to develop South-South/South-East?\n\n\u201cNot where they come from, it\u2019s what they carry and what they have to offer. May the best of the best of Nigerians rise, whether they\u2019re from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south.\n\n\u201cIf there are agreements between politicians among themselves on rotation, a bargain is a bargain. That\u2019s between them. But as far as this country is concerned, what we need at this stage is a man who can drive us to the Eldorado.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there is the need for the nation to adopt electronic voting to ensure that no Nigerian of eligible voting age including the Diasporas are disenfranchised.\n\nAsked about his mission at the presidential villa, Bakare said, \u201cIt\u2019s a private visit to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, and I\u2019ve dispensed what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d\n\nHe applauded the Senate for reversing itself on the electronic transmission of election results, saying beyond that, the country should also adopt electronic voting.\n\nReacting to the senate\u2019s stance, the Clergyman said, \u201cPerhaps one of the best things the present National Assembly has done, especially the Senate. Because with that, Nigerians can vote and then results can be transmitted so easily. Not only that, part of the State of the Nation address that I did on October 10, I emphasised how Nigeria\u2019s youth, especially undergraduates, are disenfranchised in our country.\n\n\u201c22.3 million students are registered, but during election, campuses are shut, they will not be able to return there to vote, therefore disenfranchised. If we can also be able to vote electronically, that will be wonderful. It will deepen and enhance our democracy.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the Diaspora sends above $25 billion to Nigeria. Nigeria in Diaspora should also be able to vote as they do in every other country in the world. The more the merrier. Yes, democracy is a game of numbers, but our people should have the final say, so the office of the citizen must be as important, if not more than the office of the governor or the president because they are the people who put them in power. Sovereignty still lies in the hands of the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn his support for restructuring, Bakare affirmed that it\u2019s a step that must be taken to move the nation forward.\n\nHe clarified, \u201cI\u2019d said it, it\u2019s in the open, the documents are already there, it\u2019s not something I can cover in five minutes. We can do it without shooting any gun. The lecture after lecture after lecture, I have prepared and I\u2019ve made copies available to Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it, to move this nation forward. The founding fathers of this nation; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, alongside their entourage in Lancaster House and everywhere, agreed on what type of government Nigeria should have. We must not change the goalpost in the midst of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better off together as a nation than going our different ways. But it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and a rule of law.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he would contest the 2023 presidential election, he said he would, only if God and Nigerians want him to.\n\nBakare added, \u201cEvery Nigerian, who is of age and who is not disqualified by any means, is free. I\u2019m a nation builder, if God wants me to do that, and the people of Nigeria will appreciate that, why not? I\u2019m as free as anybody to do anything with my time. I\u2019ve pastored a church for 33 years, now we raise new leaders. I want to focus on nation-building.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the President is only one office, there are so many other things we can do as people to support whoever is there to make sure that we do not go into retrogression, but begin to make steady progress as a people. I\u2019ve already communicated clearly, my future plans to Mr. President, and it stays between us.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The founder of Citadel Global Community Church (formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly), Pastor Tunde Bakare, has said that it does not matter where the next President comes from as long as the President can deliver good governance.\n\nThis is as he voiced his support for the electronic transmission of votes in the 2023 elections and subsequent ones, saying it will protect eligible voters from disenfranchisement.\n\nBakare said this on Friday after a private meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nBakare, who in 2011 was the running mate of Buhari on the platform of the Congress for Progressive Change, was scheduled for a 12-noon meeting with the President in his office.\n\nDespite his previous close political affiliation with Buhari, the clergyman had in recent times castigated his regime.\n\nSpeaking with State House Correspondents after the meeting, he said the visit was to \u201cdispense what was in my heart\u201d to the President.\n\nOn power rotation, Bakare stated, \u201cI had said it on October 3. It\u2019s our immaturity, politically and otherwise, that makes us say power must either be in the North or be in the South, instead of looking for the best, the fittest, the most competent, and people of character, who love this nation.\n\n\u201cListen to me, if where the president comes from will make the place he has come from to be better, the northern part of Nigeria should be the richest and should be the most progressive and the most developed because out of 61 years, the north has produced either the president or heads of state for 40 to 41 years, and yet see the retrogression in the North.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s from the South, why should a person like President Obasanjo freeze and seize the account of Lagos State in his own tenure? If it\u2019s from South-South or South-East why couldn\u2019t President Jonathan use all his powers to develop South-South/South-East?\n\n\u201cNot where they come from, it\u2019s what they carry and what they have to offer. May the best of the best of Nigerians rise, whether they\u2019re from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south.\n\n\u201cIf there are agreements between politicians among themselves on rotation, a bargain is a bargain. That\u2019s between them. But as far as this country is concerned, what we need at this stage is a man who can drive us to the Eldorado.\u201d\n\nHe also said that there is the need for the nation to adopt electronic voting to ensure that no Nigerian of eligible voting age including the Diasporas are disenfranchised.\n\nAsked about his mission at the presidential villa, Bakare said, \u201cIt\u2019s a private visit to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, and I\u2019ve dispensed what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d\n\nHe applauded the Senate for reversing itself on the electronic transmission of election results, saying beyond that, the country should also adopt electronic voting.\n\nReacting to the senate\u2019s stance, the Clergyman said, \u201cPerhaps one of the best things the present National Assembly has done, especially the Senate. Because with that, Nigerians can vote and then results can be transmitted so easily. Not only that, part of the State of the Nation address that I did on October 10, I emphasised how Nigeria\u2019s youth, especially undergraduates, are disenfranchised in our country.\n\n\u201c22.3 million students are registered, but during election, campuses are shut, they will not be able to return there to vote, therefore disenfranchised. If we can also be able to vote electronically, that will be wonderful. It will deepen and enhance our democracy.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the Diaspora sends above $25 billion to Nigeria. Nigeria in Diaspora should also be able to vote as they do in every other country in the world. The more the merrier. Yes, democracy is a game of numbers, but our people should have the final say, so the office of the citizen must be as important, if not more than the office of the governor or the president because they are the people who put them in power. Sovereignty still lies in the hands of the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn his support for restructuring, Bakare affirmed that it\u2019s a step that must be taken to move the nation forward.\n\nHe clarified, \u201cI\u2019d said it, it\u2019s in the open, the documents are already there, it\u2019s not something I can cover in five minutes. We can do it without shooting any gun. The lecture after lecture after lecture, I have prepared and I\u2019ve made copies available to Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe need to do it, to move this nation forward. The founding fathers of this nation; Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, alongside their entourage in Lancaster House and everywhere, agreed on what type of government Nigeria should have. We must not change the goalpost in the midst of the game.\n\n\u201cWe are better off together as a nation than going our different ways. But it must be based on equity, justice, fair play and a rule of law.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he would contest the 2023 presidential election, he said he would, only if God and Nigerians want him to.\n\nBakare added, \u201cEvery Nigerian, who is of age and who is not disqualified by any means, is free. I\u2019m a nation builder, if God wants me to do that, and the people of Nigeria will appreciate that, why not? I\u2019m as free as anybody to do anything with my time. I\u2019ve pastored a church for 33 years, now we raise new leaders. I want to focus on nation-building.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the President is only one office, there are so many other things we can do as people to support whoever is there to make sure that we do not go into retrogression, but begin to make steady progress as a people. I\u2019ve already communicated clearly, my future plans to Mr. President, and it stays between us.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019ll lubricate businesses negatively impacted by Covid-19 \u2013 Expert \u2018\u2026Ensure reasonable return on investment, drive economic growth\u2019 \u2018\u2026SMEs can now overcome logistics, goods transportation hiccups\u2019 \u2026Apex bank must address corruption, kickbacks\u2019 challenges \u2013 Adefolarin \u2026It should create more attractive loans for SMEs \u2013 Spare parts dealer\n\nAcross the globe, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have continued to be the livewire of any industry, but in Nigeria, that is not the case as the poor state of infrastructure means SMEs haven\u2019t been able to fulfill their potential. BENJAMIN UMUTEME, in this report, examines one of the initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) aimed at reversing the trend.\n\nNigeria\u2019s battle with poor infrastructure is legendary. There was a time in the history of the country when its infrastructure was in top shape, but in the late 1980s, things began to go awry as the lack of maintenance meant that the country\u2019s infrastructure began to experience a downward spiral and presently, its poor state is making life unbearable for the citizens.\n\nOf the lot, what has suffered most is the road infrastructure. Nigeria has a fairly extensive network of roads, railroads, airports, and communication infrastructure. The road system is by far the most important element in the country\u2019s transportation network, carrying about 95 per cent of all the nation\u2019s goods and passengers. However, deliberate neglect by successive administrations meant that there has been serious damage to the economy.\n\nPrevious, current attempts\n\nDuring the Goodluck Jonathan administration, the federal government attempted to fix infrastructure with the award of N927 billion in contracts between November 2011 and September 2012. However, when the Muhammadu Buhari- led All Progressive Congress (APC) administration assumed power, it set itself to fix the country\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure. And this it has done in the six years it has been in power. As a way of matching words with action, the administration has deliberately increased allocations to capital expenditure. For instance, in the last six years, the federal government spent over N8 trillion on infrastructure and this has largely been through borrowings. In spite of the amount spent so far, infrastructure development remains grossly inadequate relative to the nation\u2019s requirements due in part to lack of funds.\n\nIt is estimated that Nigeria needs to spend about $3 billion annually for the next 10 years to address the huge infrastructure deficit that continues to stare the country in the face.\n\nCBN\u2019s initiatives\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address this long-term challenge, the CBN established the Infrastructure Finance Office on March 01, 2010. The mandate of the Office is to, among others, evolve a sustainable financing framework to stimulate long-term financing for infrastructure development in the country. The apex bank has since undertaken some steps to improve the sector as follows: The N300-billion Power and Aviation Intervention Fund (PAIF); the bank provides N300 billion facility for investment in debentures to be issued by the Bank of Industry (BoI) in accordance with Section 31 of the CBN Act 2007, for investment in power and aviation projects. The funds are to be channelled through the BoI for on-lending to deposit money banks at a maximum interest rate of 1.0 per cent for disbursement at concessionary interest rate of not more than 7.0 per cent and a tenor of 10 \u2013 15 years. At the same time, the African Finance Corporation (AFC) will serve as technical adviser to the Fund.\n\nThe N15trn InfraCo Fund\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the measures by the apex bank to further encourage banks to lend to the real sector of the economy, particularly SMEs, infrastructure and agriculture, it introduced the N15 trillion InfraCo Fund to further boost the economy. The Fund is required to support business owners such as the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as support infrastructure investment that will have a multiplier effect on growth across critical sectors.\n\nThis is coming at a time when many businesses need funds to get their mojo back as they are hampered by the lack of access to finance, inadequate infrastructure and poor digital penetration. It will also create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and preserve existing ones, thus furthering the much-applauded ambition of the Buhari-led federal government to create 100 million jobs and drastically reduce poverty in the country.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the InfraCorp Fund, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said it would help to support infrastructure investment, provide reasonable return on investment and drive medium to long-term economic growth.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cInfraCorp would enable the use of mostly private capital to support infrastructure investment that will have a multiplier effect on growth across critical sectors. The purpose of the N15 trillion being raised is to address some of our infrastructure needs while providing reasonable returns to investors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe this well-structured fund can act as a catalyst for growth in the medium and the long run. The support of the banking community will be important in achieving this objective.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 views\n\nFinancial experts have commended the apex bank\u2019s move to give fillip to the government\u2019s effort to drive development and growth of the economy by making the business environment conducive. According to them, the long-term effect will give businesses the much-needed boost that would finally set the economy on the path to sustainable growth.\n\nIn a telephone chat with this reporter, an economist, Friday Efih, said with the CBN setting aside N15 trillion to be put into Infrastructure development, the long- term effect on the economy can only be imagined.\n\n\n\n\u201cI commend the CBN for this initiative; it shows that, like Emefiele said, the CBN is a responsible bank that would do everything within its mandate to help to drive economic growth. If businesses take advantage of this window that is provided by the apex bank, the challenge of the lack of access to power, inability to access finance and poor infrastructure would die a natural death,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn his view, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, noted that the infrastructure fund would lubricate businesses that have been impacted negatively by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CBN infrastructure fund was an expansionary policy that hinges on lubricating businesses in Nigeria, especially at the advent of Covid-19 pandemic, the after effects of recessions in the country. The funds disbursement is a laudable financial inducement to boost our SMEs and allied businesses.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdefolarin further acknowledged its timeliness, stressing that it would do SMEs a world of good as it will increase their capital outlays and make available funds that will enable them to expand in stocks and machinery.\n\n\n\n\u201cSecondly, it also provides opportunities for SMEs to increase their productions and services. Thirdly, it creates the needed liquidity for SMEs to expand their market niches and cover areas of interest as well. Fourthly, the CBN infrastructure fund is strategic to SMEs in meeting up with some of the usual challenges confronting them and as well as reducing them. What comes to mind now are the challenges of electricity power, materials, equipment, machinery, rents and recruitment of the right skills and manpower.\n\n\u201cLastly, it will help SMEs to overcome logistics and transportations of goods and others.\u201d\n\nBPE\u2019s disclosures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria Bureau Statistics (NBS) data on Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) showed that SMEs contributed about 48 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP in the last five years with a total number of about 17.4 million. Also, they account for about 50 per cent industrial jobs and nearly 90 per cent of the manufacturing sectors.\n\nExperts are of the belief that while the multiplier effect of the intervention on critical sectors of the economy will be huge.\n\n\n\nWith the country\u2019s economic indices not looking good, improvements in infrastructure would lead to improved productivity thereby improving the quality of life which could ultimately lead to the eradication of the country\u2019s growing poverty.\n\nFor a spare parts dealer at Dei Dei Building Material Market, Abuja, George Agaye, the CBN\u2019s initiatives are commendable and added that the cost of borrowing for SMEs and others in the productive sector has been very high as banks do not have sufficient funds to give to investors.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for Nigeria\u2019s SMEs to access loanable funds from the CBN.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgaye said to make the initiative more effective, the CBN \u201cneeds to create more attractive loans for SMEs and the productive sector to enable them contribute immensely to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\u201d\n\n\n\nA business woman, Asabe Onuwa, hailed the apex bank\u2019s initiative, noting that given its function as a stimulator of the economy, InfraCorp will earn the current management of the bank a good rating with Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe CBN should sustain those roles and the tempo of introducing new initiatives,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his view, a former president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Segun Ajibola, noted that several hundreds of thousands of road network, rail lines, energy and power, water and others remain critical but sadly inadequate or dilapidated.\n\n\n\n\u201cHitherto, some reliance had been placed on other sovereigns such as China, international financial institutions such as the World Bank, ADB, etc. But there is a limit to what funding Nigeria can attract from these countries and institutions because of the not-too-friendly conditionalities usually imposed on developing countries like Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking inwards in the manner being proposed by the CBN may be helpful, but then, the framework must be right. I will recommend a private partnering via collaborative arrangements between local and foreign interests adjudged competent in providing such infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAjibola, therefore, urged the apex bank to introduce a framework for monitoring performance, which must be efficient and effective, adding that there must be a shift from seeing intervention funds as free public funds, and that such mentality must be tackled head-long if the infrastructure fund could achieve the desired goals.\n\n\n\nAn expert at PwC, Habeeb Jaiyeola, noted that while infrastructure funds are used across the world for the development of critical infrastructure, which guarantees constant returns on investment for investors, a critical element of the success of the funds remains adequate planning and strategic contracting.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the N15 trillion fund is channelled into critical infrastructure in the country that will open up sectors and markets as infrastructure challenges have been one of the major factors hindering the growth of some critical sectors in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nCriteria critical\n\nFor the initiative to be a success, according to experts, those in charge should be transparent and make every process explicit.\n\n\n\nAdefolarin told this reporter that at it stands at the moment, no amount injected through the InfraCorp is too much going by the long years of neglect of SMEs.\n\n\u201cAlso, the current systemic stifling of funding in both the formal and informal sectors which resulted in deficit productive progress would be replaced by consistent funding.\n\n\n\n\u201cFurther, we are not uncritical of this initiative especially with selection processes, criteria, terms of condition and the targeted SMEs sectors. The various SMEs are segmented so it brings to fore which SMEs received more than or less. We know that the agricultural sector have been on the good book of apex bank. Other sectors like cottage industries, ICT startup, tailoring, restaurant and groceries stores, water packaging, delivery and logistics chains, traders, printing, leather production and many others. The SMEs sector is huge, so supporting them demands unlimited access and unhindered space.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nApex bank\u2019s other initiatives\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the CBN initiatives are; the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF); and Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP).\n\n\n\nOthers are Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS); Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI); Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF).\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\n\n\n\n\nAdefolarin cautioned on the need to break away from the usual business as usual and adopt a new and effective method that would make the programme a success.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor us, there is a need for improvement on the challenges the disbursement of the funds may encounter. The CBN would need to systematically institutionalise this scheme to outlive every CBN governor or regime in power; this is because SMEs must be consistently funded.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe CBN must address the challenges of corruption and kickbacks that are mostly associated with schemes going forward; it must ensure clarity, transparency, and responsibility.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for greater awareness and media campaign beyond the current arrangement. A review of the policy to ensure sustenance and continuity; avoid politicisation of the policy and ensure women and youth greater inclusion:\n\n\n\n\u201cExplore opportunities that deposit money banks, micro-finance banks and others can be involved in this same policy across Nigeria so as to expand access to credit to SMEs. This, I believe will provide the much-needed liquidity boost to the economy.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026..Expands scope of nonprofit Revolving Loan Scheme to women\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation NGO, under the auspices of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has called on government at all levels to end food insecurity through the empowerment of rural women.\n\nThe group also advocates the inclusion of indigenous women, in enhancing agricultural and rural development, and eradicating rural poverty.\n\nThe President and Founder of the NGO, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made the call in a statement on Friday as part of activities to mark 2021 International Day of Rural Women IDRW, which is marked every 15th Oct to celebrate rural women all over the world.\n\nShe said this year\u2019s International Day of Rural Women with the theme: Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All\u201d was in line with the ongoing programmes being carried out by the Helpline Foundation in recent times aimed at encouraging access to food and addressing hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\n\nDr. Ahmadu, while drawing the attention of the government at all levels to rural women\u2019s plights in Nigeria, added that providing training and empowerment for rural women was in line with Helpline Foundation\u2019s plans of cushioning hardships associated with their environment.\n\nAhmadu said: \u201cOct 15th is set aside for the marking of the IDRW, the essence of the event is to create awareness on the rural women and their plights in FCT and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that rural women and girls play essential roles in food systems in Nigeria\u2013 from production, to processing, preparation, consumption, and distribution of food \u2013 as well as in securing household and community nutrition. Yet, unequal power relations between women and men in the household and society, discriminatory gender norms and practices, prevalent violence against women and girls, and their disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, result in unequal access to food and heightened experience of hunger, malnutrition, undernutrition, and food insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year being Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All , was as a result of neglect to the rural women by the policymakers, as the government does not remember them. So this awareness creation will make the government remember them, because they have a lot at hand, including problems of the upbringing of their children, among other things they are helplessly tackling.\n\n\u201cIt will surprise you to know that in some communities, they are treated unfairly and there is nobody to assist them. So for that, we are beckoning on the government at all levels to consider the widows in their policy-making. We are appealing to all the governments to consider and include them in their budgets. If this our appeals are considered, it will go a long way.\u201d\n\nOn the part of the NGO, she said \u201d We have so far embarked on periodic training and empowerment to the rural women annually across some selected communities in the six area councils of the FCT and suburbs.\n\n\u201cWhy we train and empower them is to enable them to cope with the harsh economy all over the world. Some of the rural women organisation that benefited from our empowerment programmes includes Yeyedu women, Bwari women and Kurudu women.\n\n\u201cAlso the Foundation has given out the none-profit Revolving Loan Scheme for women in our rural communities ongoing for the past 7 years respectively, where over 1000 have benefitted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, they don\u2019t have anybody to assist them, and the only way out is to train and empower them. We have trained about 1000 of them and after that, we gave them starter packs and advised them to be industrious and prudent in the management of their resources.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the ongoing training, Mrs Maria Afiniki, confirmed that she learned a lot through the training and was also empowered, even as she tasked the government to support genuine NGOs to assist rural women.",

The president, he said, therefore charged the Ministry on the harmonization of the development plans.\n\n\u201cThe two major plans developed with the assistance of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support the Ministry in coordinating development and implementation some years ago include the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Regional Development Master Plan and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs (MNDA), Niger Delta Action Plan.\n\n\u201cSuccessive efforts by other stakeholders in the region also led to the initiation of other existing development plans. Therefore the multiplicity of plans, absence of standardization and failure to manage the plans led to poor delivery of those plans and their expected outcomes,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIn actualizing the Presidential directives an initial study of the existing plans was carried out by a consultant engaged by the Ministry. This process produced a strategic document for the development of a united single plan for the region, which would be adopted as a working document for the committee,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile urging the committee to take the assignment very serious, he outlined the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the committee among others to include, reviewing the initiating framework for the Harmonization of the Development plans in the Niger Delta Region into a single coherent Regional Development Strategy.\n\nAlfred Abah, Director Planning, Research and Statistics in the Ministry, will chair the Committee, which is expected to enhance government efforts to achieve the desired development in the region. Membership of the committee is drawn from the Ministry and the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Committee while soliciting for the support of the Ministry and NDDC, assured the Permanent Secretary that the Committee does not have any reason to fail.\n\nHe said the committee would start by setting out a work plan and time line, which will produce the desired result and would not hesitate to co-opt any of the directorates when the need arises.",

It does not mean disadvantaging any section of the country,\u201d the CGCC founder explained.\n\nWhile briefing newsmen on Friday, Bakare also explicitly criticized the debate over power rotation describing it as politically immature.\n\nHe noted that the idea of zoning has never benefited the region where the power was resident.\n\nHe said selecting a leader should be more about what the candidate has to offer. regardless of region.\n\nThe cleric called on the best of Nigerians to present themselves for future elections.\n\n\u2018Adopt electronic voting\u2019\n\nPastor Bakare also called for the adoption of electronic voting to ensure that no Nigerian of eligible voting age, including those in the Diaspora, are disenfranchised.\n\nHe hailed the Senate for reversing its decision on the electronic transmission of election results, adding that the country should go one step further and adopt electronic voting.\n\nOn whether he would contest the 2023 presidential election, he said his plans have been made known to the president alone.\n\nHe further noted that he would contest if God and Nigerians wants him to.\n\nPastor Bakare, who has recently criticized the current administration, was Buhari\u2019s running mate under the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in 2011.\n\nA few days ago, the cleric asked President Buhari to do away with the 1999 constitution, saying it is a great inhibitor of the nation\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cMr Gorbachev, tear down this wall! Mr. Gorbachev eventually did, and Germany is better off for it today.\n\n\u201cIn the same spirit, I say to President Muhammadu Buhari: Mr President, stop passing the buck to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cTear down this inhibiting concoction of a constitution; tear it down so we can build a truly great nation,\u201d Bakare said at what he said might be the last state of the nation address from his church auditorium.\n\nAccording to the founding pastor of the CGCC, \u201cthis is one enduring legacy\u201d that the Buhari-led administration can still secure before their time in power draws to a close.\n\nBakare further argued that if President Buhari does thrash the 1999 constitution, present and unborn generations of Nigerians will remember him for it and write his name in gold when the history of the period is written.\n\nOn the other hand, he stated that if the president fails to heed the call, then, \u201chistory will record that you failed to rise to the occasion and squandered a great opportunity\u201d.\n\nThrowing more light on the need to get rid of the 1999 constitution, Pastor Bakare asserted that the constitution was erroneous to say the unity of the nation was not negotiable.",

          "text": "Nikolas Cruz will plead guilty to murder in the 2018 mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, his lawyer told a judge on Friday.\n\nCruz\u2019s attorney told a judge his client will plead guilty next week to all charges in what was the deadliest U.S. high school shooting. He faced 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder.\n\nBroward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer noted Cruz, now 23, could change his mind before his plea hearing, which she agreed to set for 9 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nCruz was 19 and an expelled student at the time of the Feb. 14, 2018 mass murder.\n\nProsecutors at the Broward State\u2019s Attorney Office have said they will seek the death penalty for Cruz, noting in court documents that the shooting involving an AR-15 rifle was \u201ccold, calculated and premeditated.\u201d\n\nEven if Cruz pleads guilty to the charges and avoids a criminal trial, he would face a penalty phase in which a jury would decide whether he should be sentenced to life in prison or death, said Paula McMahon, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nIn Florida, juries determine whether to impose a death sentence. So if prosecutors are not willing to drop the death penalty as part of any plea deal that may be struck with Cruz, then a jury would decide.\n\n\u201cThere have been no plea negotiations with the prosecution. If he pleads guilty, there would still be a penalty phase,\u201d McMahon told Reuters in an email.\n\nIn a separate criminal case heard by the judge on Friday, Cruz pleaded guilty to all four charges of assault and battery on a law enforcement officer stemming from a jail attack on Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Sergeant Raymond Beltran in November 2018. Before accepting his plea, she asked him if he understood the impact the assault case could have in the murder case.\n\n\u201cSir, I need to advise you that the state is going to be using this conviction in this case as evidence of an aggravating factor for purposes of arguing in favor of the death penalty. Do you understand that?\u201d Judge Scherer asked Cruz.\n\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d answered Cruz, who stood next to his lawyer after officers brought him to the courtroom from a holding area. Cruz, who wore a blue face mask, a navy blue sweater, white collared shirt and ivory pants, spoke in a strong, clear voice.\n\nThe judge deferred sentencing in the assault case, in which Cruz was accused of kicking, hitting and punching the officer as well as attempting to remove his Taser to hit him in the head.\n\nSome of the families of the 14 students and three staff killed and 17 others injured when the troubled former student opened fire have rallied to call for gun control.\n\nYet a report by a state-appointed commission on the shooting recommended arming teachers, spending more on school security and mental health and training police to be more aggressive when responding to school shootings.",

          "text": "A long-serving member of Parliament was stabbed to death Friday during a meeting with constituents at a church in England, an attack that united Britain\u2019s fractious politicians in shock and sorrow. A 25-year-old man was arrested at the scene.\n\nPolice gave no immediate details on the motive for the killing of 69-year-old Conservative lawmaker David Amess and did not identify the suspect, who was held on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe attack came five years after another MP, Jo Cox, was murdered by a far-right extremist in her small-town constituency, and it renewed concern about the risks politicians run as they go about their work representing voters. British politicians generally are not given police protection when they meet with their constituents.\n\nEssex Police said officers were called to reports of a stabbing in the town of Leigh-on-Sea just after noon and arrested a man and recovered a knife.\n\n\u201cWe are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the wider public,\u201d police said.\n\nSky News and other media said Amess was attacked during a regular meeting with constituents at a Methodist church in a residential section of the seaside city about 40 miles (62 kilometers) east of London. Paramedics worked at the scene without success to save his life.\n\nAmess had been a member of Parliament for Southend West, which includes Leigh-on-Sea, since 1997, and had been a lawmaker since 1983, making him one of the longest-serving politicians in the House of Commons.\n\nA traditional Conservative on the right of his party, he was a well-liked figure with a reputation for working hard for his constituents and campaigning ceaselessly to have Southend declared a city.\n\nHe was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 for his service, becoming Sir David.\n\nPoliticians from across the political spectrum expressed shock and sorrow at the death of Amess, who leaves a wife and five children. Flags at Parliament were lowered to half-staff.\n\n\u201cThis is an incident that will send shockwaves across the parliamentary community and the whole country,\u201d House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said. \u201cIn the coming days we will need to discuss and examine MPs\u2019 security and any measures to be taken, but for now, our thoughts and prayers are with David\u2019s family, friends and colleagues.\u201d\n\nViolence against British politicians is rare, but concerns have grown in recent years about the increasingly bitter polarization of the country\u2019s politics.\n\nIn 2016, a week before the country\u2019s divisive Brexit referendum, Cox, a Labour Party lawmaker, was fatally stabbed and shot in her northern England constituency. An extremist was convicted.\n\nCox\u2019s widower, Brendan Cox, tweeted Friday: \u201cAttacking our elected representatives is an attack on democracy itself. There is no excuse, no justification. It is as cowardly as it gets.\u201d\n\nBritish lawmakers are protected by armed police when they are inside Parliament, and security there was tightened after an attacker inspired by the Islamic State group fatally stabbed a police officer at the gates in 2017.\n\nBut politicians have no such protection in their constituencies. Amess published the times and locations of his open meetings with constituents on his website.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May, a Conservative, tweeted that Amess was a \u201cdecent man and respected Parliamentarian, killed in his own community while carrying out his public duties. A tragic day for our democracy.\u201d Ex-Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was \u201cshocked and horrified.\u201d\n\nTwo other British lawmakers have been attacked over the past two decades during their \u201csurgeries,\u201d regular meetings where constituents can present concerns and complaints.\n\nLabour legislator Stephen Timms was stabbed in the stomach in 2010 by a female student radicalized by online sermons from an al-Qaida-linked preacher.\n\nIn 2000, Liberal Democrat Nigel Jones and his aide Andrew Pennington were attacked by a man wielding a sword during such a meeting. Pennington was killed and Jones wounded in the attack in Cheltenham, England.\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s slaying, Conservative lawmaker Tracey Crouch tweeted: \u201cHeartbroken. I could write reams on how Sir David was one of the kindest, most compassionate, well liked colleagues in Parliament. But I can\u2019t. I feel sick. I am lost.\u201d\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party tweeted: \u201cElected representatives from across the political spectrum will be united in sadness and shock today. In a democracy, politicians must be accessible and open to scrutiny, but no one deserves to have their life taken while working for and representing their constituents.\u201d\n\nCarrie Johnson, wife of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, wrote on Twitter that the news was \u201cabsolutely devastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was hugely kind and good. An enormous animal lover and a true gent,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is so completely unjust.\u201d\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Church of England, said the killing was a blow to \u201ceveryone who desires a peaceful and flourishing democracy.\u201d",
