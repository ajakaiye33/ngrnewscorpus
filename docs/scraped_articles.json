          "text": "The House of Representatives has asked the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to suspend the plan to review electricity tariff in June.\n\nIt also condemned electricity distribution companies for transferring debts incurred by former occupants of building to the new occupants or tenants.\n\nAt the plenary on Thursday, the House adopted a motion moved by Aniekan Umanah titled: \u2018Call on the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission to Suspend the Proposed Increase in Electricity Tariff\u2019.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the motion, the House urged the Federal Government to direct NERC to \u201crescind the decision to further increase electricity tariff proposed for June 2021 in view of the hard times Nigerian masses are currently going through.\u201d\n\nThe House further mandated its committees on Power, Poverty Alleviation, and Labour, Employment and Productivity to ensure compliance with the resolution.\n\nUmanah, while moving the motion, noted that the Electric Power Sector Act of 2005 established the NERC with a mandate to license Discos, determine the operating codes and standards, establish customer rights and obligations and set cost-reflective industry tariffs.\n\nThe lawmaker also noted that the Act prescribed its funding from 15 per cent of electricity charges paid by customers to the Discos.\n\nHe recalled that the NERC, working with the Discos, had increased electricity tariffs five times since 2015, the latest being on January 1, 2021.\n\nUmanah said, \u201cThe House is aware that despite those increases, Nigerians have not enjoyed significant improvement in power generation, instead they daily grapple with epileptic services from the Discos and unilateral exploitation in the name of estimated billing arising from non-metering of over 50 per cent of consumers.\n\n\u201cThe House observes that poor services by the Discos have impacted negatively on the socio-economic growth of the country as the International Monetary Fund Report of 2020 on Nigeria indicated that the manufacturing sector lost over $200bn to inadequate power supply, while $21bn was said to have been spent by Nigerians on generators within the period under review.\n\n\u201cThe House further observes that the Nigerian masses have gone through so much hardship in recent times arising from acts of terrorism, banditry, kidnappings, and farmers herdsmen\u2019s crisis with its toll on agricultural activities, displacement from ancestral homes, loss of loved ones, starvation arising from inability to return to daily occupation and loss of personal properties running into several million of naira.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker added, \u201cThe House is concerned that at a time governments all over the world are adopting measures to cushion the devastating effects of the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic on their citizens by providing a wide range of palliatives to losses of loved ones, jobs, businesses and general distortion in the social life, NERC is tinkering with the idea of a further increase in electricity tariff after that of 1 January, 2021, in a country where two-thirds of the 200 million population is grappling with the crippling effects of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe House also unanimously adopted a motion by Olatunji Shoyinka titled: \u2018Need to Investigate Transferred Debts Incurred by Old Electricity Customers to New Users by Distribution Companies in Nigeria\u2019.\n\nThe lawmakers consequently resolved to mandate the House Committee on Power to \u201cengage the distribution companies and other relevant regulatory agencies to find a lasting solution and report within four weeks.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Open grazing/spare parts comparison: Malami under fire as Akeredolu, South stakeholders lampoon AGF",
          "text": "Comparing open grazing to spare part sale betrays terrible mindset \u2013 Akeredolu\n\nSenate spokesman wants Malami fired, says AGF under primordial sentiment\n\nStand thoughtless, prejudicial \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nComment nonsensical, says Falana\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, on Thursday came under fire for dismissing Southern governors\u2019 ban on open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Senate spokesman, Ajibola Basiru and others, who criticised the AGF, said his comment fell short of what Nigerians expected from the chief law officer of the country.\n\nSouthern governors last week at their meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital, banned open grazing as part of measures to address insecurity, particularly killings and kidnapping by armed herdsmen.\n\nBut Malami, in an interview on Channels Television on Wednesday, described the ban as unconstitutional, saying, \u201cIt is as good as saying, perhaps, maybe, the northern governors coming together to say they prohibit spare parts trading in the north.\n\n\u201cDoes it hold water? Does it hold water for a northern governor to come and state expressly that he now prohibits spare parts trading in the north?\u201d\n\nMalami\u2019s statement annoying, preference for anarchy\u2013 Akeredolu\n\nReacting to the statement, the Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, said the ban had come to stay.\n\nIn a statement he personally issued, Akeredolu said the Malami\u2019s statement was unfortunate and unexpected from a senior advocate.\n\nAkeredolu said, \u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a senior advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy. Clinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to loss of lives, farmlands and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange, it, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset. The decision to ban open grazing stays and it will be enforced with vigour.\u201d\n\nAGF\u2019s stand thoughtless, prejudicial \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nOn its part, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, lashed out at Malami for comparing open grazing to spare parts sale in the North.\n\nOhanaeze, in statement by its spokesman, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said the remark by the AGF was \u201cthoughtless, insidious and prejudicial.\u201d\n\nIt also described Malami\u2019s statement as \u201cmalevolent, ominous and incendiary.\u201d\n\nWhile reminding Malami of his past statements, where he said that \u201cthe rule of law is subservient to national security\u201d, it said he (the AGF) had become a chief law officer that twisted the law at will.\n\nOhanaeze added, \u201cMalami had also condemned the Amotekun security outfit by the South-West and so on. Malami knows that there has never been a report of a clash between the Southern motor spare parts sellers and the indigenous northerners.\n\n\u201cThe motor spare parts sellers render their services to the populace from shops or sheds and are in no way comparable to the Fulani herders who invade farmlands, destroy crops, debauch women, maim, abduct and kill.\u201d\n\nRemove Malami, Senate spokesman tells Buhari\n\nThe Chairman, Senate Committee on Media, Basiru, in a statement in Abuja asked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to remove Malami from office immediately.\n\nHe said it was \u201cless than dignifying\u201d to be equating open grazing with southerners selling spare parts in the North.\n\nThe Senator, who said he issued the statement in his personal capacity, stated, \u201cIt was not dignifying of the status of the nation\u2019s Attorney General and Minister of Justice to make such remarks.\u201d\n\nThe Senator said equating the activities of archaic nomadic herdsmen destroying people\u2019s means of livelihood with others legitimately carrying on businesses by selling spare parts in their shops stood logic on its head.\n\nThe Senator noted that the statement of the attorney general was one capable of derailing the unity, peace and progress of Nigeria.\n\nHe, therefore, called for \u201cthe immediate removal from office of the AGF.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAnyone who cannot rise above primordial sentiments and pursuit of parochial ethnic agenda need not occupy position of trust especially at this time of sectional agitations.\u201d\n\nThe Senator also advised those who had no meaningful contributions to national discourse operating on the basis of equity and justice to keep quiet and stop rubbishing the Buhari-led APC regime.\n\nHe challenged the AGF to cite relevant sections of the constitution which allowed the herders to trespass on other people\u2019s land and destroy the crops in the guise of freedom of movement, adding that AGF\u2019s comment was less than patriotic.\n\nMalami\u2019s comment dangerous, raising tension \u2013 Abaribe\n\nAlso, the Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, accused the attorney-general of threatening the nation\u2019s unity.\n\nAbaribe, in a statement in Abuja by his media aide, Uche Awon, said Malami\u2019s statement had exposed his mindset about some people in Nigeria.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhile the local \u2018bureau de change\u2019 business mostly done by the Fulani is operating in all parts of Nigeria, why have they (Fulani bureau de change operators) not elicited any resentment of other Nigerians?\n\n\u201cIt is simply because they live and do their business peacefully without any problem. It is the murderous activities of Fulani herders that have given rise to the current demand for laws that will bring about peaceful coexistence of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the correlation between spare parts sellers in a rented shop or government properly designated area and marauding Fulani herders destroying farms, killing and raping thus trampling on people\u2019s private properties and means of livelihood?\n\n\u201c Such a divisive statement from a top Federal Government official, in fact, the chief legal adviser to the Federal Government at that, exposes a very dangerous mindset. This disposition has no doubt raised the tension in Nigeria to a frightening level.\u201d\n\nComparing open grazing to spare parts sale nonsensical \u2014Falana\n\nOn his part, a human rights lawyer, Mr Femi Falana (SAN, in a statement, said it was funny that Malami, who is the chief law officer, was ignorant of the fact that northern governors had taken a decision to ban open grazing since January.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn April 27, 2018, the members of the National Economic Council resolved to ban open grazing and adopt the Livestock Transformation Plan of the Federal Government. The National Economic Council is constituted by the Vice President, the 36 state governors, the Minister of Finance and the central bank governor.\n\n\u201cOn February 9, 2021, the Northern Governors Forum banned open grazing in all states in northern Nigeria. On February 11, 2021 the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum banned open grazing in all the 36 states of the federation.\u201d\n\nThe senior advocate said comparing spare parts trading with open grazing was nonsensical.\n\nFalana argued that spare parts traders paid rents and had been known to be peaceful in their conduct.\n\n\u201cThe AGF equally said that banning open grazing is like banning the sale of spare parts. The comparison is not applicable as the sellers of motor parts who operate in shops and markets in all states have not been accused of engaging in the killing of fellow citizens and destruction of their properties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ban on open grazing has not affected the rights of herders to move freely and acquire land in any state for the establishment of ranches in line with the provisions of sections 41 and 43 of the constitution.\n\n\u201cSince the constitution does not cover the right of animals to move freely and destroy farmlands it is grossly misleading to give the impression that the ban on open grazing has abrogated the right of herders to carry out their business,\u201d he argued.\n\nFalana advised Malami to note that as the AGF and minister of justice, he ought to watch his utterances in order not to divide the country.\n\n\u201cMalami should be reminded that he is the AGF and Minister of Justice of Nigeria. So, in making statements he should always regard the sensibilities of every part of the country and respect all legitimate interests of the entire people of the country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, also condemned Malami.\n\nIn a statement issued by a chieftain, Mr Sola Ebiseni, on its behalf, the group said Malami\u2019s statement showed his support for killer herdsmen.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe sectarian and emotional vituperations of Abubakar Malami on the ban of open grazing of cattle by the governors of Southern Nigeria did not come to discerning Nigerians as a surprise.\n\n\u201cIt only pitiably exposed him as being most unfit for the office of the attorney-general having always allowed his sectarian disposition to becloud his eminent qualifications.\n\n\u201cContrary to his latest vituperations, the ban on open grazing and movement of animals by foot is not a denial of freedom and liberty of movement and does not require the slightest touch of the constitution for the governor to pronounce. For the attention of Malami, most of the states already have laws banning open grazing and the pronouncement of the governors was merely to give effect to an existing law.\u201d\n\nSpare parts dealers, legitimate traders \u2013 S\u2019South governors\n\nThe Chairman, South-South Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Delta State Ifeanyi Okowa, also faulted the AGF.\n\nThe governor, who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olise Ifeajika, said the spare parts traders obeyed the laws of the land.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe spare parts traders before starting their business, rented shops or as the case maybe, bought land and built shops. They obey the laws of the land.\n\n\u201cHerdsmen move their cattle into people\u2019s farm and destroy their farm produce. When the owners talk, the herders will kill, destroy, rape their women and even kidnap them.\u201d\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, in a statement, said the AGF\u2019s comment was beyond the scope of his powers as he was not in a position to interpret the constitution.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe proponents of open grazing support it with the right to freedom of movement granted under Section 41 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis section cannot be interpreted to violate other constitutional provisions, especially Section 43 that grants the right to private or public property.\u201d\n\nThe National Patron of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Senator Walid Jibrin, in an interview with journalists in Kaduna, said open grazing by herdsmen was outdated.\n\nJibrin called for an alternative to open grazing and commended southern governors for the ban. He also berated its critics.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nAlhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, on Thursday said calls for secession in some quarters in Nigeria was unacceptable.\n\nThe minister made this known while delivering a speech virtually at the opening ceremony of the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) held in Bauchi State.\n\nMohammed, however, said it was rational and ideal for citizens to call for restructuring and true federalism, adding that whatever challenges facing the country can be overcome.\n\n\u201cWhile it is alright for citizens to call for restructuring and true federalism, what is not acceptable is the call in certain quarters for secession.\n\n\u201cWhatever challenges we have today as a nation, can and will be surmounted. In fact, the Federal Government had set in motion the necessary machinery to tackle the challenge of insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe should therefore not allow today\u2019s challenges, whether in the area of economy or security, to jeopardise our unity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe information minister, who apologised for not being able to be physically present in Bauchi for the event, however appealed to NIPR to use its platform to work for the unity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat task has never been more urgent than now against the background of discordant voices in the country and calls for separation.\n\n\u201cI see NIPR as a capable partner in government\u2019s effort to douse the tension in the land and beat the drum of unity rather than the drum of war.\n\n\u201cMay I also repeat my call to NIPR to raise voice against those fanning the embers of disunity and discord in the country. Without a country that is peaceful and secured, there can be no development.\n\n\u201cThis administration is doing everything possible to return peace and security across the country,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe further urged the NIPR to partner with the federal government in the fight against fake news, misinformation as well as hate speech.\n\nEarlier, Mallam Mukhtar Suraju, the National President, NIPR, said the event was coming at a time when Public Relations was solely needed to redirect the compass of the country.\n\nHe observed that all promises the country held were bedevilled by so many challenges, many of which he said were ordinarily avoidable and unnecessary.\n\nSuraju said the challenges ranged from insecurity to social tension occasioned by mutual mistrust and suspicion among leaders of various components of the country.\n\nHe, however, added that NIPR believed in Nigeria and its continued corporate existence.\n\n\u201cWe believe we are much better off together than staying in bits and pieces but this must be based on trust and confidence of all of us and one another.\n\n\u201cWe must therefore continue to engage ourselves constructively and sincerely so that we will bequeath a better nation to future generations of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, who was represented by his Deputy, Alhaji Baba Tela, appreciated NIPR for allowing the state to be the host of the AGM.\n\nMohammed, who said the NIPR meeting was first of its kind in the whole Northeast, explained how much he relished his professional bond with the institute.\n\nHe also expressed gratitude for the cordial relationship between his administration and the state chapter of NIPR, adding that such a relationship will not only be maintained but also strengthened.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that activities that graced the occasion include cultural dance and conferment of \u2018fellow\u2019 title on some members who were also given their fellow medallion, among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nThe effort towards consolidating democracy in Africa by the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation (GJF) received a boost on Thursday with the Foundation\u2019s signing of a memorandum (MOU) of understanding with the African Union (AU) to establish an effective partnership between the two parties for promoting peace and a culture of good governance on the continent.\n\nThe African Union Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Ambassador Bankole Adeoye and the Executive Director of GJF Ms Ann Iyonu signed the agreement at a ceremony at the AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where both parties expressed the need to improve peace, security and governance in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Ambassador Adeoye described the collaboration between the AU and the organisation founded by former Nigerian President Dr Goodluck Jonathan as a landmark event, noting that the continental body looks forward to rewarding results from the initiative.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are committed to the cause of promoting democracy in Africa. That is why today we think this is a landmark event. It is also very strategic for us to push ahead with the idea of promoting good governance, peace and security because without good governance there will be no peace and security and without peace and security there will be no democracy. As we sign this agreement, I believe we are signing for the good of our continent and the future of our peoples.\n\nA statement issued by GJF spokesman Mr. Wealth Dickson Ominabo quoted the commissioner to have further said: \u201cOn behalf of His Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, I also congratulate former Nigerian President Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan for this initiative.\n\nIncidentally, I was Nigeria\u2019s ambassador here in Ethiopia when he started the initiative. It took some time, but I am happy that today the dream of this collaboration has become successful.\n\nOnce again, I want to congratulate the foundation. I believe that today marks the beginning of a closer and practical collaboration that will lift the work that AU does in this regard. \u201d\n\nIn her remarks, Ms, Iyonu who represented the Foundation noted that GJF was founded in 2015 for the advancement of peace and prosperity on the African continent, adding that it serves as a platform to champion and catalyse democratic governance across Africa.\n\nAlso read:\n\nShe maintained that the focus of the Foundation is consistent with the \u201cAfrican Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ADC) which was adopted by member states of the African Union (AU) in 2007 to promote liberal democracy, human rights, peace, security and stability on the continent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further Iyonu said: \u201cSince its establishment, the Foundation has successfully implemented projects targeted at building a democratic culture of accountability and strengthening of governance. Recently, we launched the West African Elders Forum whose members are former Presidents and respected leaders of the sub-region. The Forum aims at proactively limiting instability and violence and protecting the integrity of the democratic process.\n\n\u201cThe Foundation believes that credible elections inspire goodwill and patriotism in the people and rallies them to common goals and agenda for the public good. It is for this that GJF and its founder and chairman have continued to crusade for improved processes which require an impartial electoral management body to build public confidence in electoral processes and ensure transparency, integrity and credibility of elections.\u201d\n\nShe further commended the AU for seeing meaning and strength in the work of the Foundation, saying: \u201cWe are pleased that the African Union is not only identifying with this aspiration but is also collaborating with us in the effort to enthrone an enduring democratic culture and encourage good governance in Africa\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

A situation report (SITREP) by one of the intelligence services sighted by PRNigeria said that the notorious terrorist leader must have been killed during the struggle for power between the Boko Haram and the ISWAP groups. The reports stated that \u201con May 19, 2021, about 1829hours, ISWAP top fighter, Baana Duguri-on this selector \u2013 geolocated around Sambisa forest, Pulka Gwoza LGA BRS, informed ISWAP logistics commander, Modu Sulum- geolocated opposite General Hospital Konduga LGA Borno state, that they killed Abubakar Shekau over all BH leader in Sambisa Forest date.\n\n\u201cDuguri disclosed that the ISWAP fighters\u2019 team surrounded the BH leader with his team and shooting ensued between the two factions. Duguri further added that Shekau detonated a bomb and killed himself when he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Duguri informed Sulum that the two sides also lost some fighters during the shooting. He averred that even yesterday, ISWAP was pursuing Abubakar Shekau and he discarded his cap and ran, but, today, the pursuit continued and he was finally killed. Duguri asked Modu Sulum if the other BH members who fled are returning to their houses?\n\n\u201cIn his response, Sulum rejoiced over the death of Abubakar Shekau and glorified God over the success. He also said few BH members are returning to their houses.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian military has placed all Borno State Commands of the Nigerian Army and Air Force on alert. The troops have lately been carrying out discreet bombardments around the Sambisa axis and Lake Chad axis, which may have triggered the current crisis and strife between the two, hitherto, collaborators.\n\nFindings revealed that ISWAP has been in pursuit of Shekau, which led to him discarding his camp and running off until he was rounded up yesterday, which led to his death. The clash also resulted in some casualties on the ISWAP side. When contacted by PRNigeria, the spokespersons of the military and intelligence services were reluctant to talk.",

          "text": "Says with Buhari\u2019s \u2018commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it\u2019s obvious that we should join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of \u2018\n\nBy Bassey Inyang\n\nThe Governor of Cross River State, Professor Ben Ayade has given reasons why he defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress.\n\nAyade announced his defection on Thursday morning at the Executive Council Chamber of the Governor\u2019s office while hosting seven governors of the APC; among them Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Senator Hope Uzodimma of Imo State; Hon. Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State; Jigawa State Governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; and the Chairman of APC National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlso present was the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\nSome of the governors and the minister had stormed the state since Wednesday to lobby Ayade to join the ruling party in Nigeria.\n\nWhile announcing his decision to dump the PDP, Ayade declared that henceforth, Cross River State has become an APC state, and urged all his supporters and followers to go to their respective wards and register with his new party.\n\nBefore decamping formally to the APC, he held a two-hour meeting with the APC delegation led by the party\u2019s interim chairman and governor of Yobe State.\n\nOthers at the meeting were the state deputy governor, Prof Ivara Esu, Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Eteng Williams Jones and members of the state house of assembly, some National Assembly members, members of the Cross River State Executive Council members, local Government chairmen, councilors and some stakeholders, including Dame Princess Florence Ita-Giwa and High Chief Asuquo Ekpenyong amongst others.\n\nSpeaking on why he was joining the APC, Ayade highlighted the character and attributes of President Muhammadu Buhari and the realisation that Cross River, which has been emasculated economically following the ceding of its oil wells, needed to be in sync with the party at the center, as the main reasons for moving.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201chaving seen and known the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and his commitment to this country, his nationalistic disposition and all the efforts he has made to bring Nigeria to where we are today, it is obvious that at this point we needed to join hands with him to build a Nigeria that we can be proud of .\n\n\u201cWe need all governors to recognize that it is not party that matters. It is character, it is honor, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation. We all need to as a team work ahead of the president by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us.\n\n\u201cI believe that if everyone of us as governor joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, an elated Buni said he and his team were in the state to formally welcome Governor Ayade to the APC.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am here on behalf of the APC family to welcome His Excellency the Executive Governor of Cross River State formally to the APC. As from today he is the leader of the party in the state. \u201d\n\nMinutes after his formal defection, Ayade took to the social media where he further explained why he dumped the PDP for the APC.\n\n\u201cThis morning I formally joined the All Progressives Congress. This decision was borne out of the need to bring Cross River State in sync with the policies and programs of the federal government. I believe that if everyone of us as governors joins hands with Mr President, I think we can sit on the same dining table and fashion out a way to govern this country.\n\n\u201cWe need all Governors to recognize that it is not party that matters. It is character, it is honor, it is commitment to the vision of this great nation.\n\n\u201cWe all need to as a team work ahead of the President by working towards building a prosperous country that the succession worries of 2023 will come without the fears and the worries the international community has for us,\u201d Ayade wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFormer Leader of the 7th Senate of Nigeria, and Secretary, APC 2018 National Convention Planning Committee, Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, SAN, a chieftain of the APC from the state has joined in welcoming Ayade into the party.\n\nIn a press statement issued by Ndoma-Egba on Thursday, he described Ayade\u2019s entry into the APC as a good development for the state.\n\nThe statement made available to journalists in Calabar read as follows:\n\n\u201cCongratulations Governor Ben Ayade:\n\nOn behalf of myself and political associates, I heartily congratulate Your Excellency, Senator Prof. Ben Ayade, Governor of Cross River State on your well thought out decision to formally defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) today and join the league of Progressive Governors in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency will recall that Cross River State has always been in the mainstream of Nigeria politics. There is no gainsaying the fact that the past 6 years of being in the opposition has impacted the State negatively, even though you have consciously navigated the ship of governance in sync with the APC-led Federal Government. As a State, we can ill afford to remain in the opposition. I commend you for recognizing this fact and doing the needful for the good of our dear State.\n\n\u201cAs you join us in the Progressives fold, my expectation is that your coming will enrich our internal democracy and I enjoin you to be consultative, inclusive, democratic, transparent and accountable because these are the hallmarks of the All Progressives Congress family. I also expect that your presence in the APC will further strengthen the party and improve our electoral fortunes in Cross River State. I have no doubts that the APC family in the State has received you with open arms and will work with you to reposition our dear State on the path of unprecedented socioeconomic and sociopolitical development.\n\n\u201cOur core objective remains forging a stronger, united and formidable APC that will deliver the dividends of good governance to all Cross Riverians irrespective of political affiliation, ethnicity and religion. I trust that you are well in tandem with this.\n\n\u201cOnce again, congratulations and welcome to the All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the laws of the respective states banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people.

          "text": "Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, says Rochas Okorocha, his predecessor, refused to be registered as a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking when he received the APC registration and revalidation appeal committee in Owerri, the Imo capital, on Thursday, the governor maintained that he has promoted an all-inclusive process in the state, irrespective of affiliations.\n\nHe, however, said he will not allow the process to be hijacked by selfish individuals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not unaware that some people wanted to hijack the process. What I assure everybody is that nobody will be excluded. I recall getting a phone call from the governor of Niger state, telling me that the former governor, Okorocha, complained,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUzodimma, however, added that after attempts to get Okorocha to participate in the registration process, \u201cthe governor called me back from Niger state and told me that from all indications, Okorocha is not serious; that instead of talking about registration, he\u2019s talking of party structure\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had issues before I became the governor. As a result, people had their sympathies here and there. But after I became governor, I don\u2019t have a choice but to unite the membership of the party,\u201d Uzodimma said.\n\n\u201cThe committee I set up to supervise the registration, a few days ago, said they were approaching two million. And I told the speaker, if INEC registration in Imo state is four point something million, you must get me three million. I cannot make this type of statement if the idea is to exclude people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that some of our leaders in this party need help.

          "title": "Stax wants you to enjoy USSD with better design, without ever dialling codes again",
          "text": "The BackEnd explores how tech products are built in Africa, highlighting uniqueness, user behaviour assumptions, pilots, pivots and challenges during the product cycle. A new edition every other Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nMost people who started using mobile phones in the 2000s became familiar with USSD through loading and checking airtime balance. With time, mobile banking became a major use case; again for airtime transactions, but also for buying internet data, sending money and paying bills.\n\nUnlike mobile apps that need to be downloaded and installed, USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data, if you insist) is lightweight and straightforward to use.\n\nDial the code for the desired service, follow the instructions e.g. \u201cpress 1 to Check Balance\u201d on each page and, provided there isn\u2019t some \u201cconnection failure\u201d or \u201centry error\u201d, your wishes will come true.\n\nA misconception is that USSD is for people who use basic phones but the feature has become mainstream even among smartphone users in Africa. A study of smartphone users in Bangladesh, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa showed that 87% of all financial-related transactions were conducted via USSD, with only 13% via mobile app.\n\nSo, USSD works well. But it still has its fair share of frustrating glitches that you normally wouldn\u2019t encounter on an app. For one, you need to memorise the code for each service you want to access. You could minimise an app to get information from, say, your notes app. But you mostly can\u2019t minimise a USSD session once it\u2019s started.\n\nUSSD\u2019s original design did not foresee \u201chow the introduction of smartphones would bridge the worlds of computing and telecommunications to form an entirely new industry,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say we should throw it away. On the contrary, some companies recognise that USSD is here to stay in Africa. As such, they are merging the best of both worlds: stacking the visual appeal and interactivity of smartphones on top of USSD\u2019s simple and efficient backend.\n\nOne such company is Hover, a US-based company, and their solution is called Stax.\n\nMaking USSD smart\n\nStax is a mobile app currently available only to Android users in 10 countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It has three use cases: buy airtime, send money, and request money. All without ever dialling any USSD code.\n\nStax\u2019s main promise is that users never have to dial a code again\u2026 while enjoying USSD.\n\nIt\u2019s not a digital wallet or account, so it doesn\u2019t ask for an email address or phone number. But \u2013 and this is an important but \u2013 Stax needs certain phone permissions.\n\nWhat permissions? Three precisely: to make and manage phone calls; send and view messages; and access your contacts.\n\nWith those enabled, you can input how much airtime you want to buy, choose the bank or fintech-powered account you want to debit and input the phone number to credit or select from your phonebook.\n\nIt would be great if this is where it ends but \u2013 somewhat unfortunately \u2013 Stax asks for two other permissions to complete this task of buying airtime. Permission to display on top of other apps on your phone and another to connect with mobile money and telecom services on your behalf.\n\nThis gave me pause and maybe it is because of the copy: \u201cAllow Stax to have full control of your device?\u201d\n\nThree paragraphs beneath that question describe why the permission is needed. But all the bad news I have absorbed about privacy risks over the past four years flashed before my eyes, discouraging me from clicking \u201cAllow.\u201d\n\nJess Shorland, co-founder of Hover, agrees that some work needs to be done to make users more comfortable with the permissions. But she has an explanation for why they are necessary:\n\n\u201cIt allows us to automate the USSD session on behalf of the user. We\u2019ve basically built a different interface for USSD. The user interacts with that interface in a way that is a lot more screen-reader friendly.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one big permission request\n\nIn other words, the accessibility permission is what enables Stax to do these things on the user\u2019s behalf.\n\nWhen a user gives Stax access, the app activates a screen reading functionality and acts as a web browser. USSD is still happening in the background but instead of presenting those USSD screens, Stax\u2019s SDK reads the USSD dialog, runs the functions and shows the user a familiar app interface.\n\nBut what are the risks? Because there is no way to convince a user that giving up control doesn\u2019t somehow make them a little vulnerable. Shorland says Stax only takes the information needed to enable the user complete their transaction.\n\n\u201cEverything happens client side, not on our servers. It\u2019s also what enables us to be offline,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the app is open-source as a sign of transparency.\n\nWho in Africa needs Stax?\n\nI guess it\u2019s kind of cool that Stax, a fintech app, works offline like regular USSD. But with the internet being more central to the digital and financial services space today, why should we cheer for Stax?\n\nHover CEO and co-founder Ben Lyon says they are \u201cbuilding for the world as it is today so that we can bridge it to where it ought to go.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, there were 159 million monthly active mobile money accounts in Africa, according to the GSM Association. Africa represents more than half of the global mobile money usage.\n\nLyon thinks such numbers and smartphone usage \u2013 expected to double to 678 million by the end of 2025 \u2013 will make USSD even more mainstream. \u201cIt is a standard view of the tech industry that USSD is a bygone thing. It is actually just categorically wrong.\u201d\n\nIf that view is wrong as he insists and if USSD\u2019s user experience needs to be modernised for the smartphone age, then solutions like Stax would seem right on time.\n\nStax wants the app to be under 10MB so that it will work easily on every (Android) phone. Average transaction time is supposed to be 12 seconds.\n\nMy airtime purchase this morning took a bit longer. It showed a transaction failure message at the end and my bank debited me two seconds later. But I got the airtime.\n\nStax is\u2026 a work in progress\n\nAs of today, Stax currently supports transactions for eight banks (Access, First, Guaranty, Keystone, Sterling, UBA, Wema, Zenith), OPay and Paga.\n\nBeing in the USSD business in Nigeria means getting into the CBN (banks) vs NCC (telcos) scuffle around who pays for USSD services. What does Hover think about this debate?\n\n\u201cBecause we believe that USSD is about accessibility and inclusion, I believe strongly that consumers should not pay to access the channel,\u201d Lyon says.\n\n\u201cI hope NCC and other players come around to this view that consumers should not pay.\u201d\n\nOutside of that and other potential headaches, Stax\u2019s focus will be on convincing individuals and businesses that the app is reliable for all seasons and geographies, regardless of internet connection, says Peace Itimi, who leads growth for the product.\n\n\u201cWe are not monetizing Stax yet and it\u2019s not on the near term roadmap to monetize it,\u201d Lyon says. \u201cThere is a WhatsApp sized opportunity here and our first priority is to make sure we can seize the opportunity at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBen also name-drops WeChat as a possible inspiration for monetization. With a large user base, Stax could begin enabling discovery and access to third party services, in what could make Stax a super app of sorts.\n\n\u201cWhen people understand what the product can do, they will fall in love with it,\u201d Itimi says.\n\nThat depends: on how they fix those curious accessibility permissions, and if people really feel the need to switch from basic USSD \u2013 which works okay \u2013 to a shinier, app-enabled life.",

          "title": "Many people have one concern: NITDA warns Nigerians against digital colonialism as Whatsapp\u2019s new privacy policy takes effect",
          "text": "Whatsapp has been more subtle about telling users to sign new terms of service but NITDA says some dangers remain\n\nIn January 2021, users of the popular instant messaging app Whatsapp got notifications about new terms of service and an updated privacy policy. The notification came with the warning that if users did not accept the new terms by February 8, they would lose access to the app.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the world\u2019s most popular apps and owned by Facebook, a company many people distrust, that sort of announcement will hog headlines. There\u2019s also the fact that many tech users are becoming concerned about privacy and the kind of data apps collect about them.\n\nSo for a few weeks, we saw articles suggesting that people should switch to apps like Telegram and Signal, which do not collect as much information on their users. As a result, Signal saw a rush of downloads.\n\nAlthough the pushback was intense, Whatsapp did not budge on its terms and privacy policy; instead, it decided to soft-pedal on the new terms of use and be more subtle about getting users to sign it.\n\nWhatsapp still wants you to agree to new terms\n\nIn the weeks leading up to a new deadline of May 15, Whatsapp began sending reminders to users as an in-app notification. While it will no longer block users from using the app if they don\u2019t agree to the new terms, it will restrict some functionalities.\n\nThe company said in a blog post in May, \u201cfor the last several weeks, we\u2019ve displayed a notification in WhatsApp providing more information about the update. After giving everyone time to review, we\u2019re continuing to remind those who haven\u2019t had the chance to do so to review and accept. After several weeks, the reminder people receive will eventually become persistent.\u201d\n\nWhatsapp is swapping its forceful method and wants to send reminders until users agree. Yet, countries are still concerned, and in Nigeria, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NIDTA) issued a statement Tuesday about Whatsapp.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp users are at liberty to decide on giving consent to the processing of their data based on the new privacy policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) recognises; we have consent (a clear, unambiguous expression of privacy terms communicated by the controller and accepted by the Data Subject) as one of the lawful basis for data processing. Acceptance of the new privacy policy and terms of use implies that users\u2019 data would now be shared with Facebook and other third parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers will now be subject to the terms and policies of Facebook and other receiving entities with or without being direct subscribers to such services.\u201d\n\nNITDA is wary of new policy\n\nAt the heart of the new terms, Whatsapp wants to become a place where businesses directly sell to customers. Small businesses will have virtual storefronts, while bigger businesses will be able to integrate Whatsapp into their existing technology stack.\n\nIn a statement, NITDA published some portions of Whatsapp\u2019s new policy\n\nOne concern many people have is whether Facebook will have access to their Whatsapp chats, but the company insists that messages on the IM platform are encrypted end-to-end. Yet, NITDA says users should \u201climit the sharing of sensitive personal information on private messaging and social media platforms as the initial promise of privacy is being overridden on the basis of business exigencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNITDA is exploring all options to ensure Nigerians do not become victims of digital colonialism,\u201d the agency added in its statement.\n\nIt is not clear what these options are. For now, the choice ultimately lies with users who will determine how to guard their privacy as WhatsApp\u2019s new rules go into effect.",

The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody. Despite the crash in value, holders only lose when they sell off their assets at the current prices.\n\nThe second part of the Asemota tweet mentioned above projected strength: \u201cStill buying the dip on margin though. Worst case, I lose everything. Best case, I can afford another condo.\u201d (He explained his risk calculus in a follow-up tweet).\n\nOther bruised holders like Francis are confident of a rebound. \u201cThe only thing I can do [is] HODL,\u201d an acronym popular among crypto enthusiasts that could be interpreted as Hold On for Dear Life.\n\nOgechukwu is also holding on, saying he is in the game for the long haul. \u201cI won\u2019t be selling. I know I will still grow but looking at the value still makes my stomach churn.\u201d\n\nWhile it is mainly a consumer affair, Dip Day affects crypto companies who facilitate trades. Binance experienced network congestion on Wednesday (I tried to sign up, unsuccessfully). ETH and ERC20 withdrawals were temporarily disabled for about an hour.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder of Buycoins, a Nigerian crypto exchange, is looking beyond the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat matters is my long term thesis and aggressively improving the tech so it\u2019s tangibly accessible to as many people as possible around the world,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nWhat does Musk, the unanimous hero and villain of this story so far, think of all this?\n\nTesla has \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 19, 2021\n\nWhich, in the crypto world, is another code for \u201cHODL!\u201d",

          "text": "ZOLA Electric, one of Africa\u2019s leading renewable energy providers, has launched a robust distribution scheme to drive market penetration and access to its product in its quest to provide clean, effective, and reliable power anywhere.\n\nOlufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria\n\nAlready, ZOLA Electric has signed into their distribution network some of the leading distributors of solar and renewable products across Nigeria and has opened its doors to onboard even more. Blue Camel, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions including PV panels, solar streetlights, solar home systems, and a major distributor for global solar brands, was recently signed into the scheme. Blockchain, Black bit Solar, Shokenny Solutions, Enersys Energy, Solarmate Energy, and SOSAI Renewables are already in different stages of the distribution partnership.\n\nAlmost half the population has no access to electricity. The rest of the Nigerian population is grossly underserved by the electricity grid. As a result, diesel generators are the default source of power, with an estimated 100 million people currently relying on diesel generators each day (GTM, 2019). According to Nigeria\u2019s Rural Electrification Agency (REA, 2017), the use of these generators collectively costs Nigeria\u2019s households and businesses nearly USD 14 billion every year, while the Energy to Access Institute (Dalberg, 2019) estimates that fuel subsidies for small gasoline-powered generators cost the government USD 1.6-2.2 billion each year. Besides the economic costs, diesel generators entail significant health risks including lung disorders caused by emissions, as well as environmental risks including air and noise pollution. Diesel generators produce about 29 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions each year in Nigeria, a total comparable to the annual emissions from 6.3 million passenger vehicles.\n\nSigning on distribution partners will contribute significantly to help bridge the electricity supply deficit by expanding access to ZOLA\u2019s innovative power solutions across the country.\n\nThe move by the brand, which currently serves over one million users across three continents in over ten countries, is part of its efforts to boost its current market operation, as well as provide reliable power solutions to markets that lack energy access and make it possible for homes and businesses across Africa and anywhere in the world to generate, store and consume energy sustainably.\n\nAdebimpe Adebisi, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric Nigeria; Olumide Ajayi, Group Director, Technical Operations, ZOLA Electric; Enobong Kennedy, Group Marketing Director, ZOLA Electric; Olufemi Ashipa, Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria and Natasha Amaefuna, Business Development Manager, ZOLA Electric during the ZOLA Electric Media Meet at the ZOLA Experience Centre in Lagos on Tuesday, May 18, 2021.\n\nCommenting on the development, the Ag. Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria, Olufemi Ashipa, said; \u201cThe solar space in Nigeria has come a long way from the days of using dirty and expensive power resources to clean energy sources, offering modular and scalable technology. Since many customers do not have existing appliances, ZOLA is able to offer a closed-loop system that guarantees a certain baseline of performance and runtime. At ZOLA, we are driven by the desire to provide Africa\u2019s most extensive off-grid renewable differentiated power solutions to people anywhere. We understand that power is pivotal to accelerating the overall socio-economic development of the continent, so we have designed the ZOLA Infinity and ZOLA Flex, for this purpose.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe ZOLA power solutions help to provide customers with steady electricity supply in any situation. The ZOLA technology-driven solutions backed with superior power storage and dynamic energy charging system were conceived at Oxford University and designed in Silicon Valley. They are easy to install, scalable, and help the average home or business bridge their power deficit.\n\n\u201cWith ZOLA currently powering more than 1 million people; comprising over 200,000 homes and businesses across Tanzania, Rwanda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria, we are poised to actualise our objective providing 24 hour clean power anywhere and help the continent realise her untapped potentials.\u201d\n\nABOUT ZOLA ELECTRIC\n\nZOLA Electric is the leading renewable energy technology company in Africa and our overarching purpose is to help our end-user and distributor customers power homes and businesses and stay connected with clean, affordable, and reliable Power Anywhere. By providing affordable and accessible distributed smart storage + solar technology, ZOLA helps the average home or business leapfrog the grid.\n\nZOLA designs distributed renewable energy solutions based on the latest in smart storage, solar and power electronics technology. Adaptable to energy needs and income.\n\nStarting out 8 years ago by providing solar home solutions to off-grid rural communities in Tanzania, ZOLA has evolved into a technology company whose products can solve an energy access problem. We partner with leading companies to distribute our products globally.\n\nZOLA powers more than 1 million people each day and more than 200,000 homes and businesses across Sub-Saharan Africa. ZOLA is a recipient of the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Award and the Zayed Future Energy Prize.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

Modeled after physical galleries such as Nike Art Gallery in Lagos, artdey aims to provide an exceptional educational and customer experience. In addition, artdey has organised popular physical popups in relaxed venues in Lagos, offering locals the opportunity to shop contemporary African art both on and offline.\n\nAn Art lover at the last artdey pop up\n\nSpeaking on current and future plans for the tech marketplace, Chioma Onyenwe, artdey cofounder stated,\n\n\u201cWith the dearth of tourism caused by the pandemic, this curated platform gives African independent artists, underrepresented in the global art markets, access to global collectors, thereby increasing their chances to earn a living. In time, we hope to offer online auctions, similar to global standards set by sites such as artfinder.com and expand our database represented artists over the continent. We are also expanding our physical popups and coming to the capital of Nigeria, Abuja.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, the brand added documentary photography to the platform, where images captured will create a sense of community among other storytellers while stimulating the imaginations.\n\nTo learn more about how buyers and artists can leverage on this platform, visit www.artdey.com\n\nConnect with us on Instagram @artdeyafrica and through mail at [email protected]\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "title": "Why prices of crypto currencies are dropping",
          "text": "In the past few days, many crypto currencies have wiped off significant gains made since the beginning of the year renewing fears of the 2017 burst, where the price of bitcoin crashed from around $20,000 to below $3,500.\n\nBut experts say this time the price decline is different, as the market has stronger fundamentals and is coming into maturity on the back of institutional investments and growth in emerging market consumers.\n\n\u201cThis bitcoin bull run is not just from institutions,\u201d Marcus Swanepoel, CEO/co-founder of Luno, a global crypto currency exchange with a significant presence in emerging markets like Nigeria and other African countries, says in a tweet. \u201cOur (retail) volumes in South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Indonesia all trebled over last month and at all-time highs. Emerging market consumers are voting with their money and they\u2019re ready for a better financial system,\u201d Swanepoel notes.\n\nMore investors in the market mean renewed scrutiny into the workings of the very infrastructure that powers the market and how it is deployed. There are questions about environmental impact, use cases, illicit activity, and regulation.\n\nBitcoin, the most valuable crypto asset, has been the most affected with the price falling by over 30 percent from as high as $58,000 it recorded last week to around $36,000. It recovered on Wednesday towards $40,000 and settled around $40,229 on Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, the end-of-day bitcoin price has fallen by over 25 percent over seven days on four other occasions since the start of 2017. These were December 24, 2017, when the price fell from the $20,000 peak of the 2017 bull run; February 5, 2018, when the price fell below $10,000 as the bull run ended; November 25, 2018, when the price went to $4,000 as crypto winter set in, and Mid-March 2020, when the price fell as low as $4,000 as financial markets reacted to COVID-19.\n\nEthereum price, which surged to an all-time high of $4,308 about seven days ago, dropped to $2,200 on Wednesday before recovering above $2,800. As of press time, the price was at $2,684 on Thursday.\n\nWhile the price fall at 30 percent is high, the price level of both Bitcoin and Ethereum is still significantly high at over $40,000 and $2,000 respectively. The price decline\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\nLong before Elon Musk and Tesla came along, there have been debates over the electricity consumption of bitcoin mining and the impact it has had on the environment and climate change.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes to mine one bitcoin. At 600 seconds (10 minutes), all things being equal, it will take 72,000GW (or 72 Terawatts) of power to mine a bitcoin using the average power usage provided by ASIC miners.\n\nIn explaining why it suspended bitcoin payments, Tesla said it was concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.\n\nA report by the BBC in February found that the bitcoin network consumes 121.4TWh of power per year, which means that it would be the 29th highest energy-consuming country in the world, above Argentina and below Norway.\n\nIt is however important to also acknowledge that fiat currency printing and minting, gold mining, and the banking system consume far more energy than bitcoin mining.\n\nHowever, stakeholders in bitcoin mining and operations say the technology is built in such a way that it incentivises the use of clean power. This is because it is currently much cheaper than non-renewables, and in an industry with such significant financial rewards, this matters. Miners will always go wherever they can use the cheapest power, and they will move to those regions where power is cheapest.\n\nA report by payment firm, Square, also explains that renewable sources typically produce excessive supply when demand is low. Conversely, they struggle to provide enough when demand is high. The Square report recommends addressing divergent renewable production and demand for electricity by building an ecosystem \u201cwhere solar/wind, batteries, and bitcoin mining co-exist to form a green grid that runs almost exclusively on renewable energy.\u201d\n\nUse cases\n\nThe use cases of crypto currencies remain a concern of many institutional investors. In the past, the most uses for bitcoin have been as a speculative asset \u2013 investors stake capital in hopes of trading for high capital.\n\nBut crypto currencies like bitcoin have potential for transforming payments and remittance in the financial services sector. This is why the market continues to celebrate the entrance of payment institutions such as PayPal, Mastercard, and Visa in the market. US banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have also provided support for their investors in crypto currencies.\n\nData from Chainalysis show that institutional investors have spent $410 billion to acquire their current bitcoin holdings. $300 billion of this has made a loss at a price of $36,000. However, the remaining $110 billion in profit is greater than all that had been spent to acquire all bitcoin held in mid-March 2020, when the last major price fall occurred.\n\nIllicit activities\n\nThis is one sore spot that critics of crypto currencies easily spotlight. In Nigeria where authorities have taken a hard stance on the market, the financial regulator accuses crypto currencies of funding terrorism and kidnappings, two malaise fuelling insecurity in the largest country in Africa.\n\nIronically, long before crypto currencies became a trend in the country, fiat has funded criminal networks wreaking havoc, and also oiled the bank accounts of corrupt politicians. But the anonymity of crypto currencies is making it very attractive for criminals.\n\nCybercrimes are also rising with criminals demanding for payment in crypto currencies. A report on Ransomware 2021 by Chainalysis found that known payments to attackers rose 337 percent from 2019 to 2020, when they reached over $400 million worth of crypto currency. Ransomware is reportedly the fastest growing segment of cryptocurrency-related crime, with victim payments to attackers growing 311 percent to reach nearly $350 million worth of crypto currency.\n\n\u201cAttackers show no signs of slowing down in 2021, and have already taken in more than $81 million from victims so far this year. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are low-end estimates, and that the true numbers are almost certainly higher,\u201d the report released in May 2021, noted.\n\nIt is a challenge that many crypto currency operators are still scrambling for answers for. In the absence of regulation, crypto currency exchanges have since taken up the challenge to build their own security firewalls, these efforts have mostly paid off as the number of breaches has reduced significantly.\n\nRegulation\n\nInstitutional investors are also wary of regulatory positions that do not favour the crypto currency market. China, which has since 2017 flirted with the idea of not supporting crypto currency transactions, this week reiterated that financial institutions and payment companies were banned from providing services related to crypto currency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) toed a similar prohibitive path in February 2021. India is also planning a review of regulation for the crypto currency market. The Indian government is reportedly looking at the possibility of regulating crypto currency. Unlike China and Nigeria, Indian authorities think a blanket ban recommended by former finance secretary Subhash Garg in 2019 has become out-dated.\n\n\u201cThere is a view within the government that the recommendations made by the Subhash Garg committee are data and a fresh look is needed at use of cryptos rather than a total ban,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn Nigeria, the government is not totally aligned with an outright ban of the market. The Vice President and many lawmakers have disagreed with the CBN on the prohibition, recommending regulations for the market instead.",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor and Atedo Peterside have faulted the comment by the attorney-general of the Federation, Abubakar Malami opposing the ban on open grazing. They have said such a view was deceptive.\n\nRecall that the Southern Governors forum took the decision in the meeting in Asaba, the Delta State capital recently; they had complained that the movement of armed herders, bandits into the Southern region had constituted security breaches which had affected the everyday lives of the people.\n\nOpen grazing is the archaic practice of moving ruminant animals in open fields, plains and bushes in search of pasture or foliage, in recent time it had led to clashes between farmers and herders across Nigeria with thousands of lives lost, while thousands have also been displaced from their ancestral homes.\n\nBut speaking in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today Programme Wednesday, Malami, noted that such a decision would not stand because it violates Nigerians right to free movement, violating the provision of the law of the country.\n\nHowever, in a tweet Thursday, Atedo noted that the constitutional right to movement of people does not correspond to the free movement of cattles and destruction of properties across the country.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous to link a ban on open grazing to the constitutional right to the free movement of persons. The later does not extend to the free movement of cattle, goats, sheep etc through farms with the attendant destruction of somebody\u2019s harvest,\u201d Atedo said.\n\nAkeredolu, who is the chairman of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, spoke in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, titled, \u2018Our decision is irreversible and will be enforced\u2019.\n\nThe Ondo Governor, urged the AGF to challenge the Southern Governor\u2019s position on open grazing in court, stressing that Malami\u2019s view on the issue was wicked considering the problems and damage of open grazing to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI have just read the press statement credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Shehu Malami SAN on the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing in their respective States.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting.

It is the murderous activities of Fulani herders that have given rise to the current demand for laws that will bring about peaceful coexistence of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the correlation between spare parts sellers in a rented shop or government properly designated area and marauding Fulani herders destroying farms, killing and raping thus trampling on people\u2019s private properties and means of livelihood?\u201d\n\nThe senator warned that, \u201cSuch a divisive statement from a top federal government official, infact the Chief legal adviser to the federal government at that, exposes a very dangerous mindset .

Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\n\u201cClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to the harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\n\u201cComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\n\u201cMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people.

          "text": "Israel\u2019s security cabinet on Thursday voted to approve a tentative cease-fire after 11 days of fighting with Hamas in Israel and the Gaza Strip.\n\nA Hamas official confirmed to Reuters that a \u2018mutual and simultaneous\u2019 truce with Israel would begin on Friday at 2 a.m.\n\nThe White House is expected to respond to the news shortly.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of a Wednesday call between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During that call, Biden said that he expects a \u201csignificant de-escalation\u201d in violence, according to the White House readout of the call.\n\nIt was their fourth conversation since violence erupted between Israel and Hamas last week.\n\nThe tenor from Washington towards Tel Aviv has grown increasingly impatient in recent days, as the death toll in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes topped 200, including more than 100 women and children. In Israel, 12 people had been killed by rockets fired by Hamas as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe latest round of fighting has marked the worst outbreak of violence since the war between Israel and Hamas in 2014.\n\nThe White House has pursued a strategy of what it calls \u201cquiet, intensive diplomacy\u201d behind the scenes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have had over 60 calls, from the president on down, with senior leaders in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and other leaders in the region\u201d since the start of the conflict, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe president has done this for a long time, for decades, he believes this is the approach we need to be taking,\u201d she added.\n\nBiden has appeared reluctant to publicly pressure Netanyahu to halt the airstrikes on what Israel says are military targets embedded in civilian neighborhoods in Gaza.\n\nThis has prompted calls from progressive Democrats in Congress and U.S. allies abroad for the president to take a more visible role and exert more diplomatic pressure on Israel, which is deeply reliant on the United States for weapons and military equipment.\n\nIn Tel Aviv on Wednesday, Netanyahu briefed foreign diplomats and ambassadors on the worsening violence and reiterated previous claims that the Israeli military tries \u201cto target those who target us with great precision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no army in the world that does more than the Israeli army, in the Israeli security services, in Israeli intelligence to prevent collateral damage,\u201d Netanyahu said.",

Ogoni used to be green, you could go to farm or fish.\n\nWe used to have very impressive harvests. You would spend just an hour in the water and you have a lot of fish. Today, you can spend the whole day without catching anything.\n\n\u201cOil was first pumped in Ogoni in 1956 by Shell. Since then, several international oil companies have extracted oil from across the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cIn Ogoni and elsewhere, communities have faced an environmental catastrophe. About 40 million litres of oil are spilled every year across the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cAir, land and water have all been contaminated, with studies reporting devastating effects on residents\u2019 health and livelihoods.\n\nVast areas of the state\u2019s waterways and mangrove swamps, one of the most diverse ecosystems in Africa have been destroyed or put at risk.\n\n\u201cFarmland has been cloaked in oil, contaminating crops and exposing people to high levels of heavy metals such as chromium, lead and mercury among others\u201d, Fabeke said.\n\nOur correspondent reports that Shell did not explicitly say that it would exit onshore Nigeria completely or give a timeline for any potential asset sales.",

All the documents ranging from the invitation letters and our client\u2019s reply with the documentary proofs will be found if demanded.\n\n\u201cSir, it is instructive to ask why the witch-hunt? Why the hurry to declare our client wanted? Why the publication without properly inviting our client in accordance with the law? What actually is the aim behind these investigations having been investigated by the DSS and EFCC on the same subject matter?\u201d\n\nKumo said he was ready to approach the ICPC the moment he is properly served with an invitation.",

If you evaluate what we have lost as a continent against what African counties owe, Africa should be a net creditor to the world. They can decide to deduct the loans given to African countries from all the money taken from the continent, there will still be a substantial amount to return to Africa.\n\n\u201cThe money should also be returned with interests as they have been in use over there. The money should be placed in an Escrow account, and a regional development bank that knows how to manage money should be in charge of such funds.\u201d\n\nThe ICPC Chairman advocated a workable framework that will reduce the timeframe for the repatriation of identified stolen funds and assets, decrying the huge loss suffered by the continent due to long and tedious processes which usually takes several years to complete.\n\nBesides, Prof. Owasanoye said there were on-going efforts by the Federal Government to block illicit outflows of funds through the review of international transactions that enable IFFs.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe are reviewing the legacy transaction in oil and gas, tax investments and the use of waivers in Nigeria to close loopholes that facilitate IFFs. For instance, a lot of damage can be done through confidential clauses in loans, oil and gas contracts, and others. The review will prevent dodgy politicians from taking money out.\u201d\n\nA member of the Thabo Mbeki Panel on Illicit Financial Flows out of Africa, Ms. Souad Aden Osman, said that efforts to stop IFFs were more critical now than ever due to the huge level of poverty and underdevelopment in Africa.\n\nIn her lead presentation titled \u201cCommon African Position on Asset Recovery (CAPAR), Osman urged African countries to mount a coordinated effort against IFFs by taking action and speaking with one voice to recover stolen funds.\n\nShe said, \u201cCAPAR is the bedrock for technical instrument for negotiating for funds taken from the continent to be returned. It recommends efficient recovery and unconditional return of stolen assets with due respect to our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nCAPAR, she added, recommended the deployment of recovered assets for the good of the citizens and not be allowed to be re-stolen.\n\n\u201cThe recovery and return of asset must be applied for the development of the country. We should be mindful that the identified assets are at the risk of retransfer unless frozen by destination countries,\u201d said Osman of the Coalition for Dialogue on Africa (CoDA), a civil society organisation.\n\nIn his contribution, the Chairman African Union Advisory Board Against Corruption (AU-ABC), Hon. Luis Andriamifidy, identified some of the challenges the Council face in repatriation of IFFs to include: the matter of sovereignties of countries involved, a common legal framework to be adopted, and how to proceed with court processes especially on admissibility of evidence, among others.\n\nAndriamifidy, who emphasised the need for a policy dialogue to ensure a common Africa position, called for a strong advocacy approach both within and outside the continent.\n\nThe Commissioner of Anti-Corruption Commission of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Francis Ben Kaifala, lamented the issue of cultural differences and how assets recovery has not taken root in many African countries unlike Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nHe revealed that his organisation had in two years recovered over $3 million in cash excluding cars, houses, among others, which was more than what they country had achieved in 18 years.\n\nHe stressed the importance of developing a common legal assistance which will reduce the resources spent in chasing after IFFs by African countries.\n\nKaifala also recommended training, development of pressure system on international bodies, streamlining of recovery processes to make them less cumbersome, and a proper framework for the discovery and disposal of assets as part of measures address IFFs.\n\nIn her lead presentation during the second plenary session, a member of the United Nations High Level Panel on IFF (FACTI Panel), Hon. Irene Ovonji-Odida, expressed the hope that the conference will result in an increased understanding of IFFs and commitment to action which is needed to curb it.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cFinancing Sustainable Development by Stemming IFFs: the FACTI Report in Perspective\u201d, Ovonji-Odida revealed the cost of financial integrity gaps.\n\nAccording to her, FACTI discovered that $1.6 trillion, which is 2.7% global Gross Domestic Product, was lost in money laundering by criminals; $500-600 billion lost to tax havens by corporations and BEPS while $20-40 billion was lost to bribes to public officials in developing countries, and $7 trillion private wealth hidden by banking secrecy in advanced countries.\n\nShe said these loses were responsible for fiscal deficits, regressive taxation, criminality, low public trust, and weak rule of law, among others.\n\nOn FACTI Panel\u2019s recommendations, Hon. Ovonji-Odida mentioned an overhaul in the international tax norms and institutions, plus a corporate tax vision including reforms on transparency; a domestic structure; law and enforcement mechanism to be reformed with increased transparency and more dynamic response to emerging risks.\n\nIn his contribution, the Chief Executive Officer, Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU), Don Deya, opined that sustaining political will was key to the issue of IFFs.\n\nHe suggested the reformation of international tax laws and institutions while calling on investigative journalists and whistleblowers to put pressure on beneficiary countries.\n\nAlvin Mosioma, Executive Director of Tax Justice Network Africa, in his contribution, also said that the problem was the lack of political will to concretise and transfer talk to action on the issue of IFFs.\n\nHe aligned his recommendations with FACTI and stressed the need for more political support; creation of accountability mechanism for leaders both globally and nationally; and increased capacity building for countries.\n\nHe finally charged Africa to organise and present a united front against IFFs which is affecting it adversely as a developing continent.\n\nOn his part, a reporter with Agence ECOFIN, Togo, Fiacre Kakpo, said Africa needed to take the bull by the horn by asking the international community to stop IFFs if they are not truly encouraging it.\n\nHe suggested that Africa insist on accurate tax information while ensuring that all loopholes in tax laws are plugged.",
          "summary": "He urged foreign beneficiaries of IFFs to deduct loans to African countries from the illegal funds in their possessions, and returned the outstanding amount with interests to the continent.\nThey can decide to deduct the loans given to African countries from all the money taken from the continent, there will still be a substantial amount to return to Africa.\nIn her lead presentation titled \u201cCommon African Position on Asset Recovery (CAPAR), Osman urged African countries to mount a coordinated effort against IFFs by taking action and speaking with one voice to recover stolen funds.\nHe stressed the importance of developing a common legal assistance which will reduce the resources spent in chasing after IFFs by African countries.\nHe suggested the reformation of international tax laws and institutions while calling on investigative journalists and whistleblowers to put pressure on beneficiary countries.",

          "text": "Opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to summon courage and hold sessions with Nigerians via townhall meetings in the six geo-political zones just like the one he had with Nigerian citizens living in France.\n\nAccording to the PDP Spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan , President Buhari should be bold to face Nigerians at home and give account of his administration in the last six years.\n\nThe PDP noted that it was not enough for President Buhari to visit far away France and attempt to use unsuspecting Nigerians living in Paris in a desperate effort to window dress the shambolic economic and security situation foisted on our nation by his failed administration.\n\n\u201cOur party holds as despicable that Presidency handlers could opt to ridicule Mr. President by making him to believe that Nigerians in the Diaspora could be swayed by cosmetic claims when they are aware of the contrary political, economic and security realities on ground in our country.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said it finds it ludicrous that President Buhari asserted in the Paris meeting that he was committed to free and fair election, when in reality, he failed to sign the Electoral Act amendment Bill.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the fact that most elections under his watch had been marred by outright alteration of results, violence, voters suppression by security operatives as witnessed in the Kogi state governorship election; as well as endorsement of the subversion of electoral mandate to enthrone the candidate of his party as the Imo state governor even when he came fourth in the election.\u201d\n\nThe party added that Mr. President owes the nation more than a passing comment in explaining how his instructions to the military led to the killing and maiming of Nigerians at the polls.\n\n\u201cMr. President must be reminded that his administration conducted the worst election in our national history as witnessed in the 2019 elections as well as some of the off-season elections.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our party shudders that Mr. President can assert that he is committed to a multi-party system, in a situation where brazen efforts are being made by his administration to strangulate the main opposition party, with various instruments of suppression including encouraging the EFCC to unconstitutionally harass our party leaders.\u201d\n\nThe PDP stressed that it was equally jolted by Mr. President\u2019s presentation of imaginary commitment of his administration towards security, economy, agriculture and education.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is even when his administration has taken no decisive steps to vanquish terrorists, bandits and kidnappers marauding our nation; when the economy is in shambles with no sense of direction by his government; when the education sector is in chaotic state as no meaningful investment has been made in the sector in the last six years and when the nation is faced with food crisis because his administration has failed to end terrorism so that our farmers can return to farmlands for production.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party urged President Buhari to end his unnecessary showboating and address the situation by ending the corruption in his administration, supporting the amendments to the electoral act and the 1999 Constitution to guarantee credible elections as well as enthroning elements of true federalism to engender state policing, fairness and equity in our country.",

The AGF is quoted to have said that this reasoned decision, among others, is akin to banning all spare parts dealers in the Northern parts of the country and is unconstitutional.\n\nIt is most unfortunate that the AGF is unable to distill issues as expected of a Senior Advocate. Nothing can be more disconcerting. This outburst should, ordinarily, not elicit a response from reasonable people who know the distinction between a legitimate business that is not in any way injurious and a certain predilection for anarchy.\n\nClinging to an anachronistic model of animal husbandry, which is evidently injurious to harmonious relationship between the herders and the farmers as well as the local populace, is wicked and arrogant.\n\nComparing this anachronism, which has led to the loss of lives, farmlands, and property, and engendered untold hardship on the host communities, with buying and selling of auto parts is not only strange. It, annoyingly, betrays a terrible mindset.\n\nMr Malami is advised to approach the court to challenge the legality of the Laws of the respective States banning open grazing and the decision of the Southern Governor Forum taken in the interest of their people. We shall be most willing to meet him in Court.\n\nThe decision to ban open grazing stays.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nGovernor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has explained that his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) is due to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s leadership qualities, saying he wants to help the 78-year-old in dealing with the challenges facing the country.\n\nAyade moved to the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday after months of speculations but explained, however, that he had no issue with his former party.\n\n\u201cAs to whether there are issues in the PDP, no. The party stood by me all through the way,\u201d the governor said during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn any other legal issue that I have had, PDP had stood with me. PDP gave me the opportunity to be a senator; PDP gave me the opportunity to be governor. I would never have any time to pull down PDP. I have integrity, character, and honour. My politics have ethics. My decision to join APC is to join the President to reduce the tension in the country.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Depressed\u2019 Governor?\n\nNigeria has in recent times grappled with myriads of security challenges and the governor is calling on citizens to rally around the country\u2019s leader to help in combating these issues which he says make him unhappy.\n\n\u201cI feel depressed when the nation is challenged with security issues,\u201d he noted. \u201cInstead of us rising as an orgasmic whole to see how we can support the President to deal with these foreign herders that are colonising our various roads and farms, we rather sit back; we tend to create an impression as if the government is not doing well.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: More PDP Governors Are Joining APC, Says Ayade\n\nThe Cross River leader also hinted that some governors on the platform of the PDP will soon join the ruling party, denying claims he defected to the APC because he suffered a huge loss at the recent PDP congress held in his state.\n\n\u201cI am happy to announce to you that very soon, more governors are joining (the APC) because what we want to achieve is a country where we all can sit with the President and agree on our succession process, we don\u2019t have to fight,\u201d Ayade explained, but did not mention the governors.\n\nThe former lawmaker also expressed joy over his defection to the ruling party, noting that his cabinet and other persons will soon move from the PDP.\n\n\u201cAll the chairmen of the local governments, almost all the House of Assembly members, most of the National Assembly members, my entire commissioners and cabinet today,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is the amount of the political structure \u2026 in Cross River State, once the governor moves, everybody moves.\u201d",

The BBC offers that today,\u201d Davie said.\n\nBashir has long been alleged to have used forged documents that suggested the palace staff were working against Princess Diana and being paid to spy on her.\n\nMatt Wiessler, a former graphic designer for the BBC, said he mocked up false bank statements after Bashir reached out to him.\n\nThursday\u2019s report found that Bashir also likely created another set of fake bank statements, which he again showed to Spencer.\n\nThe 1995 interview was a seismic moment in British public life. During the event, Diana told Bashir that there were \u201cthree of us\u201d in her marriage to Charles, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, whom the heir to the throne would later marry.\n\nBuckingham Palace was blindsided by the interview and thrown into crisis by Diana\u2019s comments, which cast a rare light on the inner workings of the royal family.\n\nThe broadcaster launched an internal inquiry in 1996 and concluded that documents had been forged but didn\u2019t play a role in Diana\u2019s decision to participate in the interview.\n\nThe report is critical of both Bashir\u2019s behavior and of the way the 1996 probe was carried out by the BBC.\n\nIt concludes that \u201cwithout justification\u201d the BBC \u201ccovered up\u2026 facts as it had been able to establish about how Mr Bashir secured the interview.\u201d\n\nThe BBC\u2019s former director-general Tony Hall, who was in charge of news and current affairs at the time of the controversy, said Thursday that he was \u201cwrong to give Martin Bashir the benefit of the doubt,\u201d according to PA Media news agency.\n\nLast week Bashir stepped down from his role as the BBC\u2019s religion editor, citing health reasons.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s investigative current affairs show Panorama \u2014 the same program which featured the 1995 interview \u2014 will air a documentary on the controversy on Thursday.\n\nThe program will examine the inside story of how Bashir obtained the interview, and how the BBC responded when it discovered he had faked bank statements and shown them to Earl Spencer.",
