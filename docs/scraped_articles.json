          "title": "Buhari restates Nigeria\u2019s commitment to safer, healthier global climate",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) has restated Nigeria\u2019s commitment to a safer and healthier global climate, listing the country\u2019s updated Nationally Determined Contribution to include the elimination of kerosene lighting by 2030.\n\nBuhari spoke during a virtual meeting, hosted by President Joe Biden of the United States, at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change.\n\nHe listed other measures to include an increase in the use of buses for public transport and a reduction in the burning of crop residues.\n\nBuhari said that an updated NDC to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had been submitted to replace the interim contribution of May 27, 2021.\n\n\u201cOur updated NDC includes the waste sector which is expected to contribute to the reduction of Nigeria\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cThis development raised an additional two per cent to the Nationally Determined Contribution from 45 per cent to 47 per cent conditionally and 20 per cent unconditionally below business-as-usual.\n\n\u201cOther action plans that are inherent in our NDC include; the elimination of kerosene lighting by 2030, increase in the use of bus rapid transit as a means of transportation for the general public.\n\n\u201cAlso, 50 per cent reduction in the fraction of crop residues burnt by 2030 and implementation of forest programmes.\n\n\u201cInitiatives to deliver 20 per cent greenhouse gas emission reductions and enhanced removals equivalent to approximately 74.2 Metric tons of Carbon Dioxide by 2030.\n\n\u201cAnd ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase out Hydro-fluoro-carbon emissions,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari also said that Nigeria was developing national frameworks for Article 6 and for carbon pricing.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have finalised the Sectoral Action Plan for the implementation of the revised NDC in the key priority sectors, namely Energy, Oil & Gas, Agriculture & Land use, Power, Transport and Water and Waste\u2019\u2019.\n\nOn the Global Methane Pledge, the President said Nigeria joined the Global Methane Alliance in 2019 with a commitment to methane reduction targets of at least 45 per cent by 2025 and a 60-75 per cent reduction by 2030.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s 2019 National Plan to Reduce Methane has started through the required voluntary actions, with an initial focus on elimination of Short-Lived Pollutants methane in the Oil and Gas sector.\n\n\u201cOur plan aims to improve air quality and reduce Nigeria\u2019s contribution to climate change through 22 specific mitigation measures in eight source sectors.\n\n\u201cThese are transportation, cooking and lighting in households, industry, waste, oil and gas, agriculture, power and Hydro-Fluoro-Carbon.\n\n\u201cAlso, adoption and ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aimed at phasing out Hydro- fluoro-carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cThe full implementation of these measures would be effective in reducing Short-Lived Pollutants.\n\n\u201cThis is with an 83 per cent reduction in black carbon emissions by 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario, and 61 per cent reduction in methane emissions.\n\n\u201cThese measures are also effective in reducing other air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, and also reduce carbon dioxide emissions,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe president said implementation of the measures could reduce exposure to air pollution across Nigeria by 22 per cent in 2030, while reducing Nigeria\u2019s contribution to climate change.\n\n\u201cMy administration approved Nigeria\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All Action Agenda in 2016, which has a target of almost tripling generation capacity in the next decade, to reach a total of 30 Gigawatt by 2030.\n\n\u201cOf this, 30 per cent will be generated from renewable resources, with almost half of this provided by medium and large hydro.\n\n\u201cThe Clean Energy Transport Scheme in major Nigerian cities involves the introduction of compressed natural gas for buses in public transport.\n\n\u201cNigeria is aware that its heavy dependence on fossil fuel makes the country especially vulnerable in a world that has a target to reduce or even eliminate fossil fuel as a key driver of the global economy,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said.\n\nHe said that a number of countries were already setting bans on the sale of oil-consuming Internal Combustion Engine vehicles.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria is also aware that short-term response to the transition from fossil fuel to clean energy may jeopardize our economic growth.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we intend to use the Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy as our transition process,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said.\n\nAccording to him, the Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy provides Nigeria the pathway to carefully assess the opportunities that might arise in terms of a cleaner, more dynamic, and more sustainable growth model.\n\n\u201cIt will also provide the options for the country to implement a less carbon-intensive model of economic development in the face of decreasing global reliance on fossil fuel energy,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nHe added that achieving a climate-neutral economy by 2050 would require progressively phasing out or profoundly changing the country\u2019s carbon-intensive industries, which would be particularly challenging.\n\nBuhari further explained that this would require a well-managed transition through effective visioning and full financial support from partners.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria is ready to partner with countries and relevant stakeholders to achieve the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nBuhari thanked President Biden for convening the important event which he said, had remained crucial to the well-being of national economies as well as the continued existence of all people on the planet.\n\nThe president also thanked other members of the Major Economies Forum for Energy and Climate Change for their commitment to climate action.\n\nHe lauded the consensus on the deployment of clean energy technologies at the lowest possible cost and the establishment of a global partnership to drive transformational progress across the globe.\n\n\u201cIt is our fervent hope and expectation that the partnership will be vigorously pursued in order to mitigate the consequential adversities of climate change on our environment.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, the bad effects of climate change are disastrous to humanity, considering the magnitude of environmental destruction and its negative impacts on our respective countries.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have witnessed several environmental challenges including creeping land degradation, desertification, and drought in the northern part.\n\n\u201cWanton deforestation, land encroachment, invasion of coastal lines, biodiversity loss, flooding and coastal erosion in the southern region of our country.\n\n\u201cThese developments reinforce Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\n\u201cThis is geared towards the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic consequences and to the rules of the 2015 Paris Agreement,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nBuhari said he had already signed the Nigerian Climate Change Bill on Nov. 18, 2021, in fulfillment of Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the Glasgow Climate Pact.\n\n\u201cThe Climate Change Act provides a legal framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring green and sustainable economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe Act will support and enable the implementation of national climate actions.\n\n\u201cThis includes accessing climate finance and carbon trading that will enable a reduction in greenhouse gases that are contributory factors to climate change and its attendant effects,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe virtual summit was addressed by about 20 presidents and prime ministers or their representatives.\n\nThose who personally did so included the host, President Biden, President Buhari, the German Chancellor, the President of Turkey, Prime Ministers of Japan and Canada as well as the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the European Commission.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The Senior Special Adviser (SSA) to President Muhammadu Buhari on Youths and Student Affairs, Nasir Adhama, has assured Nigerian youths that the President will ensure an election without interference in the coming General elections of 2023. He said the President wants to leave behind his best legacies which would include the non interference and electoral reforms before his departure from office. Adhama said this at the democracy day lecture, held in Abuja by the Nigerian Youth Congress (NYC) titled, \u2018Election and Governance: Youth as watchmen against electoral violence.\u2019\n\nAdhama who was represented by his technical assistant, Dr. Aminu Kyaku said, \u201cWe all know that this country is blessed with a huge population and the youths make up a bulk of the population so basically there can\u2019t be an election without the involvement of the youths, it is the youths vote that the politicians target to win elections. The question is what is in it for us as youths, for Mr. President, it is very clear, he is the father of Nigerian youths and I can tell you that if there is anything that this President wants to leave as one of his best legacies, it is election without interference and the electoral reforms that he has supported for INEC and the new electoral act 2022 passed into law.\u201d\n\nPresident NYC, Blessing Akinlosotu, said the lecture which is a third of its kind by the organization, is to discuss, criticize and evaluate the good, the bad and the ugly situations the country has found itself in as a people. \u201cThe unrest in the country has also largely distracted the power players to an extent that good governance is nearly becoming the impossible in all strata of government. Whereas experience teaches that the most critical moment for bad governments is the one which witnesses their first steps toward reform.\n\n\u201cThe need therefore to take the steps needed for the reform of our dear country Nigeria necessitated the ideas to organize ourselves as young Nigerians, in a manner that will hold in view the mending of our impaired democratic system which has long since, thrown us to Insecurity as a result of lack in the mutual ineligibility informed by the ethno insensibility,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Senate President Ahmad Lawan and former Niger Delta Affairs Minister Godswill Akpabio are back in contention for next year\u2019s senatorial election after their party, All Progressives Congress (APC), submitted their name yesterday to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as its candidates for Yobe North and Akwa Ibom North West respectively.\n\nYesterday was the deadline set by INEC for all parties to turn in the names of all their candidates in the 2023 presidential and national assembly polls.\n\nThe lists were channeled through a portal dedicated for that purpose by the commission.\n\nEach party was assigned a code by INEC for the uploading of its list.\n\nThe portal officially shut down at 6pm last night.\n\nThe Commission had, in a statement, said: \u201cAll nominations must be uploaded to the portal on/or before the deadlines. The portal will automatically shut down at 6.00pm (1800hrs) on Friday 17th June 2022 for national elections and 6.00pm (1800hrs) on Friday 15th July 2022 for state elections.\n\n\u201cWith this innovation, the Commission has eliminated the physical interface between party officials and INEC staff for the purpose of submitting the list of candidates for the 2023 General Election.\u201d\n\nTinubu submits forms\n\nThe media office of the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said he had \u201creturned his duly completed nomination forms to INEC\u201d as stipulated by the electoral law and Independent National Electoral Commission guidelines and timetable.\n\nTinubu\u2019s spokesman, Tunde Rahman, who signed the statement, said the forms were returned on Wednesday June 15, two days ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate that HE As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu now stands ready to contest the February 25, 2023 presidential election to deliver progressive good governance to our people,\u201d he said.\n\nOkupe is Obi\u2019s stand-in running mate\n\nLabour Party (LP) submitted the name of a former presidential spokesman, Dr. Doyin Okupe, as running mate to its presidential candidate, Mr.Peter Obi.\n\nBut Okupe himself confirmed that he was merely standing in until when the party would pick its authentic presidential running mate.\n\nHe said: \u201cNaturally, we comply with the electoral body and in doing so, we believe that choosing the vice-presidential candidate is part of the electoral process. And you will understand that Mr. Peter Obi came into the Labour Party on the 29th of May, which is exactly three weeks ago.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our idea and our reasoning is to bring together in the country, and for the first time, the largest political coalition possible, because we are facing two political giants \u2013 APC, PDP. And we are serious about upstaging them and we will.\n\n\u201cBut to do that, we cannot do it alone. We need to be able to put together this coalition and the so-called third force is now alive, and it is forming, and it is important for us to ensure that all the stakeholders are carried along from the beginning to the end.\n\n\u201cSo, because of this, I, Dr. Doyin Okupe, am standing in as the vice-presidential candidate of the Labour Party.\u201d\n\nLawan, Akpabio set for another shot at Senate\n\nThe names of the Senate President and Akpabio were on the list of the APC senatorial candidates submitted yesterday.\n\nThe duo had sought the APC presidential ticket.\n\nBut while Akpabio stepped down at the last minute, Lawan placed fourth with 152 votes in the primary.\n\nMachina mulls legal action over substitution of name with Lawan\n\nHowever, the winner of the APC Senatorial primary in Yobe North, Bashir Machina, is threatening legal action over the substitution of his name with that of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in the list sent to INEC.\n\nMachina, who had vowed not to surrender his ticket to Lawan, told reporters in Abuja last night that he would go to court to challenge alleged attempt to rob him of his mandate.\n\nHe asked the party APC to correct the omission of his name, saying: \u201cIn the list sent to INEC, my name was found to be misrepresented.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was erroneous, my name was not on the list of the names that were said to be presented today to INEC. For the avoidance of doubt, I remain the candidate duly elected to the APC Yobe North zone C senatorial zone.\n\n\u201cI am the elected candidate; I did not withdraw for anybody and will not withdraw because, as a matter of right, that is the mandate given to me by members of our great party, the delegates. So surreptitiously removing my name, I consider, is very undemocratic, illegal and of course inhuman.\n\n\u201cInsha Allah, I will take measures, first by reminding and appealing to my party that if this action is truly done, it should be corrected, especially if it is erroneously done. We are seeking redress from the National Working Committee of our party under the able leadership of Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the national chairman, that there is an anomaly and we need it to be corrected.\n\n\u201cI remain the candidate and it remains so. I hope our leadership will take the necessary measures. We will work hard to exploit and explore all the necessary channels as provided by our guidelines. In the event of the contrary, as Nigerian citizens and as law-abiding citizens, the constitution of our country is the overall law above every aspect of our lives as Nigerians, I would have no choice but to resort to court (legal) action.\n\n\u201cThis is what I intend to inform Nigerians through this medium, that an abnormality and illegality are about taking place, and it is undemocratic. This is a democratic party. It is always the will of the people that is supreme and the greatest justification of the will of the people is by casting their votes, as they did to elect me.

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, and his Social Democratic Party (SDP) counterpart, Engr. Segun Oni, were last night locked in a war of words, heightening tension ahead of today\u2019s election.\n\nOni accused the APC, which is the ruling party in the state, of intimidating its supporters. The APC dismissed the allegation as a lie.\n\nSecurity agents went round the major streets of the state capital, Ado Ekiti, yesterday in a signal to potential trouble makers to think twice while the police announced a restriction on vehicular movement from 12 a.m. to 6 p.m. today.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said everything was in place to have a successful election.\n\nEngineer Oni, during a press conference in Ado Ekiti, accused the APC of unlawful arrest and intimidation of SDP supporters for the purpose of demobilising them ahead of the polls.\n\nThis, according to him, was a breach of the peace agreement initiated by the Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering strictly to the democratic tenets and ethos in the conduct of the governorship poll, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d had been unleashing terror on his supporters with fake soldiers.\n\nHe cited the case of one of his supporters who \u201cwas arrested and detained for alleged kidnapping three days back, using a section of the police.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But peace can only be absolutely protected when you are standing on justice, equity, truth and fair-play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and be arresting people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nHe asked INEC and the security agencies to shun partisanship and provide a level playing for all candidates.\n\nBut the Director of Media and Publicity, Biodun Oyebanji Campaign Organisation, Hon. Taiwo Olatunbosun, dismissed the SDP allegation, describing it as malicious and puerile.\n\nHe said Oni resorted to cheap lies to gain public sympathy preparatory to the election, having realised that the majority of Ekiti people had abandoned his ambition for Oyebanji.\n\nOlatunbosun said the SDP were \u201ctrying to get unnecessary attention. If they know that they don\u2019t have candidates who can win election, they should quit the race. They should stop all these unnecessary insinuations and assumptions.\n\n\u201cSDP should stop chasing shadow. Are they saying APC is a security agent or agency? APC is not Police, DSS, and Civil Defence, so why are they accusing us of arrest of their supporters?\n\nArmy, Police, Amotekun in show of force in Ekiti\n\nArmed soldiers, policemen and operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and those of the Ekiti State Security Network codenamed \u2018Amotekun\u2019 yesterday patrolled the major streets of Ado Ekiti in Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) in a show of force ahead of the governorship election in the state.\n\nGun-wielding security operatives were also deployed in strategic parts of the city and public buildings including the state secretariat of INEC.\n\nThe patrol caused major traffic logjams along the old Ado-Iyin Road, Federal Poly-Ijan-Ekiti, Ado-Akure, Ado-Ilawe roads all in Ado-Ekiti, and some streets in Ikere-Ekiti, the largest town in the state.\n\nPolice Inspector General Usman Akali Baba said the show of force was meant to alert residents to the security agencies\u2019 readiness for the election.\n\nBaba, in a statement through the police chief in charge of the governorship poll and Deputy Inspector General, Johnson Kokumo, equally announced a restriction on the movement of vehicles from 12 am on Saturday to 6pm for the conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cIn view of the forthcoming governorship election in Ekiti, the Inspector General of Police through Deputy Inspector General of Police, Force CID and DIG for Southwest, who is the election security Commander for the Ekiti State gubernatorial election, DIG Johnson Kokumo, wishes to inform the people of Ekiti State that the Nigeria Police Force has mobilised all necessary assets in partnership with other security agencies to provide adequate security and ensure free, fair and credible election,\u201d the police said in the statement.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cThe Inspector General of Police equally ordered the restriction of vehicular movements within the State, particularly along the entry and exit points to Ekiti State with effect from 12:00am of Saturday 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm by 6:00pm of same date.\n\n\u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate into the State and cause mayhem during, before and after the election.\n\nThe Inspector General assured residents of adequate security for all to come out en masse and vote for the candidates of their choice without fear of harassment and harassment.\n\n\u201cThe IGP hereby assures the public of the Force readiness to perform its statutory duty of protection of lives and properties of law abiding citizens of Ekiti State State throughout the period of the election and beyond while calling on everyone to support and cooperate with the operatives deployed and ensure prompt report of any suspicious person or group of persons to the nearest Police Station or call the following numbers:\n\nJoint Situation Room: 09021198809 or 07059119144 and Control Room: 08062335577\u201d, he added.\n\nNo fewer than 17,000 police personnel and about 10,000 from the NSCDC alone are on duty for the period of the election.\n\nObservers are of the view that the election will be a straight fight between Oyebanji, Oni and Olabisi Kolawole of the PDP.\n\nINEC: We\u2019re ready, BVAS will perform optimally\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) pledged yesterday that it was set for a free and fair election today.\n\nThe agency\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily that over 980,000 residents have been captured in the commission\u2019s voters\u2019 register but less than 200,000 of the figure were expected at the polling units.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have a total of 988,923 voters on the voters\u2019 register,\u201d Okoye said. \u201cThis is the number that will vote during this governorship election.\n\n\u201cOf this number, as of the 13th day of June 2022, 749,065 have collected their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards (PVCs). So, we are ready for this particular election, and every PVC that has not been collected will be mopped up and kept in safe custody pending the conclusion of the election.\u201d\n\nThe commission, he said, had deployed more Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for the exercise compared to the number of polling units where the election will take place.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn any polling unit where we have more than 750 registered voters, we are going to deploy an additional BVAS to those polling areas,\u201d the INEC national commissioner said. \u201cWe have a total of 2,445 polling units that will be used for this election, but we have deployed a total of 3,346 BVAS to Ekiti State. So, we are going to have redundancies in every registration area.\n\n\u201cWe have also trained enough registration area technical assistants who can intervene at very short notice if there is any challenge with the BVAS. From the test runs we have done, we are confident that the BVAS will perform optimally and that every person who is genuinely and legally registered to vote in this election will have an opportunity of exercising his/her right.\u201d",

          "title": "PDP: The coup that gave Okowa VP slot \u2013 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nLess than 48 hours after the Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar unveiled Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as his running mate for next year\u2019s presidential election, new facts have emerged on how power-play knocked off the choice of Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\nThis is even as the crack in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors Forum has widened since the emergence of Atiku as the standard bearer of the party.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the development told Saturday Sun how various power blocs, especially Northern leaders, spearheaded by Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), pushed for the rejection of Wike, despite the overwhelming support from governors elected on the platform of the party. One of the sources said Wike\u2019s biggest headache was the national chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, who had repeatedly accused the Rivers State governor of sponsoring the crises rocking many state chapters of the party. The source listed the crises in PDP state chapters in Edo, Cross River, Ebonyi, Delta and Anambra as allegedly sponsored by Wike.\n\nHe said worried by the development, Ayu, who is often seen as pro-North, mobilised leaders in the region to ensure Wike\u2019s defeat at the recently-concluded presidential primaries of the party. He said the last-minute power-play at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja, venue of the presidential primaries, was spearheaded by Ayu, in conjunction with the Northern leaders who prevailed on Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State to step down for Atiku.\n\nAccording to the source, who is a member of the PDP National Working Committee (NWC), Ayu, again, mobilised Southern governors who are anti-Wike, led by Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, to scuttle the governors\u2019 push to name Rivers governor as Atiku\u2019s running mate. He revealed that the 19-man committee set up by Atiku to screen possible running mates were given four names. He said out of the 19 members, 16 voted in support of Wike. The NWC member further revealed that seven out of 13 PDP governors also rooted for Wike ahead of Gov Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, Gov Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta and Gov Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu.\n\nHe said when the report was debated by the NWC of the party on Wednesday, Wike also got the endorsement of members to emerge as Atiku\u2019s running mate. The source said the governors and over 80 per cent of NWC members were shocked when Atiku and Ayu jettisoned the popular decision and settled for Okowa. He said the snubbing of governors led to the boycott of the unveiling of Okowa by eight out of 13 governors. He listed Seyi Makinde of Oyo, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia, Ugwuanyi of Enugu, Wike of Rivers, Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa, Gabriel Ortom of Benue, Tambuwal of Sokoto and Darius Ishiaku of Taraba as governors who didn\u2019t attend the unveiling. Obaseki of Edo, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, Douye Diri of Bayelsa, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi and Okowa attended the event. The source explained further: \u201cOkowa was not the first choice of PDP leaders, especially governors. They felt since Wike performed well during the primaries, he should be the running mate to Atiku. That was the arrangement.\n\n\u201cEven members of the committee constituted by Atiku settled for Wike. PDP NWC members settled for Wike. But Ayu and Atiku, without consulting anyone, announced Okowa. The decision has created more crises and if not properly managed, can mess up the chances of the party.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, Atiku was not against anyone recommended. But certain forces were vehemently against the choice of Wike, especially Northern leaders. They believe that Wike doesn\u2019t support anything that involves the North and will be a problem.\n\n\u201cBut governors and other stakeholders had a different view. For them, Wike was better placed to deliver the South for the PDP. The South East may likely vote for Peter Obi. That leaves the South South and some parts of the South West for the PDP to battle. Governor Makinde is a close ally of Wike and he would have worked well with Ayo Fayose who also supports him, to garner some votes for the PDP in the South West. But with this development, I doubt if the party can appease those aggrieved governors.\n\n\u201cNo candidate in Nigeria can win any presidential election without winning Lagos, Kano and Rivers States. They\u2019ve the highest number of votes. PDP is not in charge of Lagos and Kano. If it can\u2019t manage Wike, how will it win Rivers? These are the issues confronting the party right now.\n\n\u201cEven the NWC is divided. Unfortunately, Wike has more loyalists in NWC of the PDP than Atiku. In fact, almost all members of NWC, beside the chairman, are loyal to the state governors. How Atiku will navigate this and unite the party is a test I don\u2019t know how the PDP will pass.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*Ex-VP says he\u2019s not afraid of taking difficult decisions, donates N10m to Owo victims\n\n*Our candidate has solutions to Nigeria\u2019s challenges, Delta gov posits\n\n*Party plans to offer Wike campaign DG and prominent role in govt if they win\n\nChuks Okocha, Sunday Aborisade, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nPresidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former vice-president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has continued to receive commendations from far and near, over his choice of the Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nProminent amongst those, who had hailed Atiku over his choice partner were the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum led by the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; the Chairman, PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jubrin; former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu and Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Ndidu Elumelu, among others.\n\n\n\nAtiku had, 24 hours to deadline set for the submission of names of presidential candidates and their deputies by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), announced Okowa, as his running mate.\n\n\n\nThe main opposition party, had been back and forth on the choice of its running mate since its presidential convention on May 28, including setting up advisory committees to assist on the choice of the most suitable candidate, and further delayed till 24 hours before the INEC deadline.\n\n\n\nHowever, unknown to many, the choice of running mate is a decision the presidential candidate of any party alone, is constitutionally empowered to make and not of anyone else as clearly spelt out in section 142 ( 1) of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\n\n\nThe section states thus: \u201cIn any election to which the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Chapter relate, a candidate for an election to the office of President shall not be deemed to be validly nominated unless he nominates another candidate as his associate from the same political party for his running for the office of President, who is to occupy the office of Vice-President and that candidate shall be deemed to have been duly elected to the office of Vice-President if the candidate for an election to the office of President, who nominated him as such associate is duly elected as President in accordance with the provisions aforesaid.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, therefore, exercised this power and right, although after comprehensively consulting with other stakeholders such as the NWC, BoT, founding fathers, elders of the party to ensure that all of them were carried along, before finally settling for the Delta State governor, yesterday.\n\n\n\nHowever, sources close to the Atiku campaign informed THISDAY yesterday that, the party plans to offer Wike, who came second in the primary and was one of the top contenders for the postion of VP, the Director General of the Atiku campaign and also a very promient role in the government if they win the election in 2023.\n\n\n\nAtiku, who at the unveiling of Okowa as his partner on the presidential journey, boasted that he was never afraid of taking difficult decisions, also donated the sum of N10 million to victims of the recent attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Okowa, while accepting his nomination, claimed Atiku, had solutions to the numerous challenges bedeviling the country.\n\nReacting to the development, while Ayu, said Okowa was chosen on merit, Jubrin, also described the choice of Okowa as an act of God.\n\n\n\nAddressing party members, Atiku, said with the convention behind the party, \u201cWe have arrived at the stage for me to pick a running mate, because this is a joint ticket. I am very happy to announce today that I have reached a decision on that.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom. In these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be president. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot, which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understand the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understand the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe person must appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalised world.\n\n\u201cMy running mate must understand that without security, development will be very difficult, because local and foreign investors, who have been scared away already, would not return to invest in our economy. Thus, my running mate will be a person, who will stand by me as I confront the frightening level of insecurity in our land.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you know, the APC government went to sleep as huge swathes of our country\u2019s territory fell into the deadly hands of gangs of criminals, including those masquerading as freedom fighters or pastoralists, while our farmers and genuine pastoralists are unable to go about their businesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe costs in precious human lives and properties have been enormous. My running mate must also not only symbolise the imperative of reuniting our country but also be able to work with me to achieve that objective. This is because a united Nigeria is a potentially stronger, more prosperous, and more secure country able to lead Africa and give hope to the Black race.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn addition, my running mate has to be someone, who is not afraid to speak his mind and give honest advice, and, be by my side as I work very hard to reverse the destructive impact of the past seven years of the APC government.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP candidate explained that in the United States of America from where Nigeria borrowed key aspects of current presidential system, \u201ca running mate is used to balance the ticket, complement the candidate and, after victory, assist the president with governance. Sometimes a candidate is chosen, who generates a buzz and adds huge excitement to the campaign.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut, today in Nigeria, we face huge challenges, which leave us little room for drama. We have to win the elections and get to work immediately. My running mate has to be ready to start working with me, from day one, in addressing our country\u2019s challenges. Nigerians will not accept anything less.\n\n\u201cThat is why I promised the governors of our party that my running mate will come from among them. Our current challenges call for a government that is highly focused and disciplined.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have sought the support, guidance, and counsel of the PDP in selecting a befitting running mate, who meets all or most of the qualities enumerated above. The wisemen and sages of the party, put together by our NWC, have gone fishing and brought home an enviable group of awesome politicians that surpasses these qualities.\n\n\u201cEveryone of the recommended persons is a fit and proper individual to hold this office. While this makes me marvel at the bundle of talents that abounds in our party, it also compounded my task of choosing a single person from among them.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me, therefore, pay tribute to my party and, most especially, to all those that made the shortlist that must now be narrowed down to a single person. They are all dedicated party-men suitable for this task. I wish all the recommended persons could be announced today as my running mates. Unfortunately, only one MUST be chosen.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult decision that I am called upon to take. But, as someone hoping to lead a complex country such as ours, tough and difficult decisions would remain a part of my everyday life. Let me, therefore, start this momentous journey with a crucial decision about who, among the eminently qualified shortlist, would be my running mate.\n\n\n\n\u201cAccordingly, let me state that the person I have chosen as my running mate possesses all those identified qualities. He personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for our country but also the future that our young people yearn for and deserve. He is a serving state governor, who has demonstrated, in his state and through his conduct, that governance is about service to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know that he will not only add excitement to our already energised ticket and campaign, but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023. I am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of running mate, who will help to lead us to victory next year not only in the presidential election but also in the governorship and legislative elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country. He has both legislative and executive experiences. Please, join me in welcoming to the ticket, the next vice-president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know him to be a fighter; you know him to care about winning; you know him to care about good governance; and you know him to care about our people. Now, my dear friends, let\u2019s do the disciplined hard work necessary to win this election. Let\u2019s go. Thank very much.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking on party unity, Atiku said, \u201cParty unity is critical not only for us to prosecute a winning campaign but also to provide good governance that our country seriously deserves and our people earnestly yearn for. The task of winning the coming elections will be a tough one and we must not take anything for granted.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccepting his nomination, Okowa said, \u201cFirst, I must give thanks to God for this day and I want to appreciate the party for having a very successful convention. And I thank the national chairman and his team and the chairman of the convention committee for giving us a convention that everybody could definitely say two or three are fair. And we came out more united than people ever thought.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to thank you, sir, for all that you\u2019ve done through this very period. I thank God that you were able with your team, the National Working Committee, to steer the party through this period, and we have produced a very experienced candidate, who can take back Nigeria in our rescue missions. I\u2019m sure that we will be able to begin the rebuilding process of this nation right from May 29 2023. We must thank God for that.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. President-in-waiting, I must truly thank you for finding me worthy to be on this ticket. I do know that it was a very tough decision, even as you have spoken this afternoon. But I thank God that amongst my very qualified colleagues, even those more qualified than myself, that I found favour and I\u2019m here today as the vice-presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile thanking you, I do understand that it\u2019s a great work that is ahead of us. By the special grace of God, we will work hard to ensure victory for the party. There is no doubt that there is a great work ahead of each and every one of us.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe building back process is going to be collective and we\u2019re trusting that all of our team members will want to be part of that story at the end of the day. The story which will obviously be positive and will yield positive results, will require that each and every one of us must support our principle as we move forth in the next few months, and that at the end, we will win the elections with a landslide victory.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, we must create in ourselves, in yourself, a new approach to political issues, a new commitment, which I believe we all yearn for. It will require a lot of commitment from each and every one of us. It will require the unity of each and everyone of us in our various wards, in our various local governments and states. We need the PDP to return to power.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have answers to the questions because I\u2019ve had the opportunity of going through our candidates book, and I hope each and every one of us will take time to go through \u2018My Covenant with Nigeria\u2019. It is something worth studying. It is something put together, which I don\u2019t think, other presidential candidates of other parties have not been able to put together. You need to go through it. You will find the solutions to our problems in that document. I also appreciate our presidential candidate publicly for making this happen earlier.\n\n\n\n\u201cBased on social media reports that he has taken time to understudy, because of the experience that he has had in the past, he has been able to prepare solutions. I believe that we will definitely by the special grace of God, we go for the elections, we will wins landslide. I am very happy to be on this tickets.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am sure by the special grace of God with the national chairman leading us, it should be well with our party. Please, let\u2019s join hands together to walk with our principal to ensure that we win the elections landslide once again. I want to thank Mr. President-in-waiting for finding me worthy to be on the tickets. I want to thank the party for accepting that I be on this ticket,\u201d Okowa stated.\n\n\n\nEarlier, National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, explained that, Atiku wrote NWC to help help choose a presidential running mate, adding that upon the receipt of the letter, he set up a 17-man committee headed by the Deputy National Chairman, Ambassador Umar Damagun, and a decision reached was transmitted to Atiku.\n\nThe PDP chairman, who denounced claims that, \u201cNo voting took place when they met,\u201d stated that the selected committee reached their decision based on consensus and the presidential running mate was chosen based on own merit and criteria as the NWC has no inputs at all.\n\n\n\nThe occasion was witnessed by the Governors of Edo, Godwin Obaseki, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, among others, including all members of PDP leadership.\n\nThereafter, Okowa went for screening before the Tom Ikimi-led committee, which gave the Delta governor a pass mark.\n\n\n\nJubrin, who described the choice of Okowa as an act of God, said in a statement that, \u201cthis decision must be generally accepted as the act God, who gives life to who He wants and takes away life from who He wants. He has bounties unlimited.\u201d\n\nUrging all PDP members to accept this decision in good faith and give the strongest support to Atiku as President of Nigeria and Okowa as his vice-president, he said, \u201cBoth Muslims and Christians must come together to give support to them all.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll PDP members must come together to unite for PDP to take over from APC Government of Buhari. All Muslims and Christians must come together and forget any religious differences and regard Nigeria as one entity. All Nigerians should vote for PDP to ensure that Atiku and Okowa are fully accepted and voted for,\u201d he stated.\n\nPDP Governors Forum Congratulates Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa on VP Selection\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party Governors Forum (PDP-GF) yesterday congratulated the Governor of Delta State, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 General elections.\n\n\n\nIn a statement signed late yesterday by the chairman PDP Governors Forum. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal noted in particular that the PDP Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, promised to select a serving PDP Governor as his running mate, ostensibly not just because of the contributions of the Governors to the effective running of the Party and its stability, but because of their experience and executive capacity. He kept his word.\n\n\n\nHe said that Governor Okowa has distinguished himself as Governor of Delta State, stating that he also has cognate legislative experience as a former Senator as well as what it takes to be an effective Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nTambuwal said \u2018 the great task of recovering, rescuing and rebuilding Nigeria begins with the Atiku / Okowa ticket. The APC has completely messed up Nigeria. It has failed in all aspects of governance; insecurity, bad economy, dysfunctional education, health and social services are the hallmarks of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cWith the Atiku/Okowa ticket help is on the way. We shall overcome\u201d the chairman of the PDP Governors said.\n\nObaseki, Secondus, Ekweremadu, Elumelu Congratulate Okowa\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, former national chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, and House of Representatives Minority Leader, Ndidu Elumelu, have congratulated the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the running mate to the candidate of the PDP in the 2023 presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nObaseki, in a statement, said Okowa\u2019s emergence would translate to victory for the party in the forthcoming elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you, my friend and brother, His Excellency, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa on your emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\n\n\n\n\u201cAn energetic grassroots mobiliser, Okowa, a two-time governor, senator and commissioner, has the needed experience that would guarantee victory for our party in 2023 elections in our bid to rescue the country and place it on the path of progress and prosperity.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we embark on this all-important mission to rescue Nigeria, we must now all work together in unity, as a people and party, to reclaim our country.\u201d\n\n\n\nSecondus, in a statement from his media office, commended the duo for the maturity they brought into the contest, which must have been responsible for their eventual victory.\n\n\n\nHe described Atiku as a square peg in a square hole, whose pedigree in the nation\u2019s political space remains outstanding and speaks for itself, adding that his choice of Okowa as running mate said it all about his knack for picking good heads to be around him for the gargantuan task ahead.\n\n\n\nHe however, said with the picking of a running mate, the candidacy was complete and PDP was now set for the inevitable journey back to Aso Rock come 2023.\n\nEkweremadu, in a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, also described Okowa as highly resourceful and prepared for the office of the Vice President.\n\n\n\nHe commended the party and its presidential candidate, Atiku for the decision, while calling on all party leaders and faithful to go to work to ensure the success of the ticket at the presidential polls.\n\n\u201cI join our party leaders, party faithful, and supporters in congratulating my brother and friend, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of our great party, the PDP.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a sound choice by our presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and our party. No doubt, Okowa brings immense electoral value to the PDP ticket. He is highly resourceful and he is prepared for the Office of the VP. I urge every party leader and member to now go to work to ensure the success of the ticket at the 2023 polls,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nElumelu, in a statement, said Okowa\u2019s confirmation as running mate was no doubt informed by the confidence and trust reposed in him by Atiku, other PDP leaders and supporters of the party across the nation.\n\nHe, therefore, expressed optimism that with Abubakar leading the charge, and Okowa by his side, the PDP was sure of victory in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you, Your Excellency, Sen. Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, the humble, hardworking and down to earth Governor of Delta State, on your emergence as the Vice-Presidential Candidate of our great party the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have again brought honour and pride to our dear state, Delta, where you have demonstrated uncommon commitment as evinced in your unprecedented achievements in all sectors and we assure you and His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, of our unalloyed and unwavering support for the task ahead.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Atiku Abubakar is a statesman par excellence, a brilliant administrator, remarkably committed and competent leader, a unifier and detribalized Nigerian, who has exceptionally deep understanding of the challenges of our nation and the solutions thereto.\n\n\n\n\u201cImportantly sir, as a leader, particularly, as the Chairman of the South South Governors\u2019 Forum, I earnestly urge you to use your emergence to immediately initiate processes that will lead to peaceful reconciliations and calming of all frayed nerves including some leaders, who may feel sidelined or scorned in the process of nominating the vice-presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022PDP screens vice-presidential nominees today\n\n\u2022Party\u2019s NWC meets over c\u2019ttee\u2019s recommendations on running mate\n\n\u2022Atiku speaks on how to free up funds for social investments\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\nDesperate to beat deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has quietly submitted his forms, with the inclusion of a \u2018place holder\u2019 as running mate.\n\nAt the same time, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has constituted a 12-man committee-led by Chief Tom Ikimi, to screen the presidential nominees of the party.\n\nAlso, following the meetings of the various elders and consultative committees of the party, on the choice of a vice presidential candidate, the National Working Committee (NWC), of the PDP, met to decide on the recommendations made by the various committees.\n\nThis is as the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said his main objective was to have Nigerians, who would be the beneficiaries of his policy framework to interrogate the policies on how to reduce infrastructure deficit and free up funds for social investments in the country.\n\nAn insider in the ruling APC told THISDAY last night in Abuja that the action by Tinubu and the APC was aimed at meeting the statutory requirement and beat the Friday, June 17, 2022 deadline by INEC for presidential candidates to submit names of their deputies to the commission.\n\nBut the choice of running mate is yet to be resolved hence the decision to include a \u201cplace holder\u201d instead as vice-presidential candidate, while Tinubu and the APC were still making consultations for a suitable deputy that would enhance the party\u2019s victory in 2023.\n\nThe controversy over the suitability of the APC running with a Muslim-Muslim ticket or otherwise, has been very intense in the last few days.\n\n\u201cThe name of the running mate submitted would be changed for another northern politician in the next few weeks. The one submitted is just holding the ticket in trust for another candidate to be picked by Tinubu and the party in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe candidate is still widely consulting, because the issues around the choice of running mate are many and he is yet to address them all. So, he is still asking for more time to look into it all \u2013 whether he is running a Muslim-Muslim or a Muslim-Christian ticket.\n\n\u201cHe personally thinks there\u2019s a need for more consultation and that\u2019s what he is doing. The debate on the choice of deputy has assumed a level that is currently greater than the party and the candidate, hence the need for comprehensive consultation, which is what he is doing,\u201d a reliable party source hinted last night.\n\nThough some names had been mentioned as possible running-mate to the former Lagos state, it was gathered that no compromise have been reached yet.\n\nA source in the Tinubu\u2019s camp told THISDAY that all the northern governors want the position.\n\nThe source added that if Tinubu had his way, he would have loved to pick the former Governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima as his running-mate, but he wanted the president and the governors to pick.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAll northern governors want it. If Tinubu has his way, it will be Senator Kashim. But he wants the president and governors to pick for him.\u201d\n\nAsked why Tinubu does not want to pick his running mate himself, the source stressed he didn\u2019t want to be a winner takes it all.\n\n\u201cHe does not want to be the winner takes it all. You need to respect the president. Buhari did not choose VP for himself in 2015.\u201d\n\nFrom the PDP camp, a credible party source, had disclosed that after an extensive deliberation, where Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and sacked former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha, were considered, the vice-presidential nomination committee, settled for one of the governors.\n\nA statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, however, named Dr. Akilu Indabawa, as the Committee Secretary while Mr. Sunday Omobo, was nominated as Administrative Secretary.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the the Electoral Guidelines of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the National Working Committee (NWC), has approved the nomination of the following party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated Vice Presidential Candidate of our Party for the 2023 general election,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nOther members of the committee, the statement listed, were Chief Osita Chidoka, Member; Rt. Hon. Binta Bello, Member; Chief Mrs. Alh. Mutiat Adedoja, Member; Rt. Hon. Austin Opara, Member; Prof. Aisha Madawaki, Member; Mrs. Ayotunde George-Ologun, Member; Chief Mrs. Chidiebelu Mofus, Member; and H.E. Fidelis Tapgun, Member.\n\nThe party said the screening exercise would hold at the National Working Committee (NWC) Hall, PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, today, June 16, 2022. at 10am.\n\nDeadline for the submission of presidential candidates and the vice-presidential candidates ends tomorrow, June 17, as the INEC website shuts down automatically by 6pm.\n\nAlso, deadline for the submission of governorship and state assembly candidates ended yesterday, Wednesday, June 15, while the submission for National Assembly candidates ends tomorrow, Friday June 17.\n\nSources close to the party informed THISDAY that the NWC will submit the names of three vice presidential nominees to Atiku for his consideration.\n\nThe three nominees were of South South and South East zones.\n\nHowever, based on the timetable by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the PDP is expected to submit the names of its presidential candidate and running mate today or before 6pm tomorrow, Friday, June 17, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku, while reacting to the observations by the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), said it was important to emphasise that actively promoting private sector participation in infrastructure development would be beneficial to the economy.\n\nHe also said it was inevitable that Nigerians incentivise the private sector to take risk and invest in the economy for obvious reasons.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media office, Atiku said, \u201cThere is no telling that Nigeria\u2019s huge infrastructure deficit is making businesses uncompetitive and stunting economic growth. The supply of efficient infrastructure, including roads and rail transportation, communication, adequate power etcetera is extremely important for the economy to grow and create much-needed jobs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to build the economy of our dreams, we must increase the stock and improve the quality of our infrastructure. Inadequate infrastructure has been identified as the most problematic factor for doing business in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate further said, \u201cIn terms of actual spending, Nigeria currently spends less than 1% of its annual GDP on infrastructure as against the required levels of between 3%-5% of annual GDP. This shortfall has created a deficit, estimated at USD 3 Trillion over the next 30 years. Our overwhelmed public sector does not have the resources or expertise to deliver.\n\n\u201cWhile our financing requirement is approximately 100 billion USD per annum, Nigeria\u2019s entire budget is only USD 30 billion. The National Development Plan envisages that 80% of all investments will come from the private sector.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, Nigeria\u2019s core infrastructure sectors are not operating efficiently. Almost all the infrastructure sectors from roads, railways, housing, power, and energy are operating below potential. Over the years, we have observed how these enterprises consume huge public resources, while offering poor quality services.\n\n\u201cMany of these state-owned Enterprises have become a source for political patronage, corruption, and rent-seeking to the detriment of Nigeria\u2019s long-term economic growth\n\n\u201cFor example, Nigeria\u2019s refining infrastructure remains poor despite the perennial injection of unending public resources for turnaround maintenance. The country\u2019s refining capacity per capita is 0.002 bpd/capita compared to Libya\u2019s 0.06 bpd/capita and South Africa\u2019s 0.01 bpd/capita.\n\n\u201cAs of today, Nigeria imports over 80% of its refined products to meet its current needs and is said to be the largest importer of PMS in the world, with significant balance of trade implications,\u201d Atiku explained.\n\nSadly, he contended that, \u201cThe fiscal cost of maintaining these state-owned Enterprises is enormous, and it comes with even greater opportunity costs. By holding unto these underperforming enterprises, Nigeria is sacrificing investments in critical areas, including education, health, water, sanitation, and rural infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFor example, the first phase in the rehabilitation of Nigeria\u2019s refineries is expected to gulp US$1.55 billion! With its current precarious fiscal position and daunting development challenges, Nigeria cannot afford to forego productivity enhancing investments in human capital development and channel scarce resources to moribund enterprises.\u201d\n\nSpecifically on his policy document tagged: \u201cMy Covenant With Nigeria\u201d, Atiku said, his objective was to drive private investment to shift Nigeria from being a \u201cnet importer\u201d to a \u201cnet exporter\u201d of petroleum products and become the refining hub of the entire West Africa region.\u201d\n\nAccording to the former vice president, \u201cWe cannot hope to achieve this without extensive reforms to restore investor confidence, which is currently at its lowest ebb. The active participation of the private sector in the downstream sector will help drive efficiency and healthy competition in the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Public Enterprises, had stated that 67% of the 142 privatised firms were performing, explaining that it must be noted that several firms, not just liberalised enterprises, were facing business environment challenges in Nigeria.\n\nMany have closed and or being forced to relocate to neighbouring countries, because of the poor business environment.\n\nTo this end, Atiku said, \u201cThere is no denying the fact that Nigeria has derived enormous benefits from the creation of a liberal environment to facilitate private sector participation in key sectors of the economy. Today, the IT sector is undeniably the fastest growing services sector in the Nigerian economy. We need to replicate these efforts by extending the reform initiatives to other sectors.\n\n\u201cOf course, different countries have implemented liberalisation programmes with varied outcomes and over time and space just as other policies. But it is easier to point to success stories around the world: from Vietnam to Mexico; from Indonesia to South Africa and Egypt etcetera than outright failures.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, liberalisation and deregulation programmes, have supported the private sector to unleash its growth potentials and enabled these governments focus on investing in education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, water and sanitation with such proceeds.\n\n\u201cEvery reform measure has the potential to create difficulties especially, in the short-term, but with a positive impact on incomes, employment, and poverty, over the medium and long-term. Liberalised firms may face difficulties as they transit from the old culture of rent-seeking and dependence on government for survival, to a new business culture that is driven by efficiency and competition.\n\n\u201cBut Atiku Abubakar will ensure that his economic reform measures are accompanied by a series of mutually supportive activities aimed at easing these difficulties and making the reform measures impactful.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development at Coventry University in the UK.\n\nHis departure meant that he could no longer be around to help his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s and moved back home, he settled in Accra, where he would eventually build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. He knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate.

          "text": "This article was co-authored by Koromone Koroye, Hannatu Asheloge, and Ngozi Chukwu\n\nAfrica\u2019s technology ecosystem as we know it is thriving and primed for astronomical growth and success in this decade. Over the past 5 years, our ecosystem has celebrated several key milestones:\n\nExits and acquisitions in the millions.\n\nImpressive funding rounds ranging from seed to Series C.\n\nThe arrival of new angel investors and venture funds eager to serve African entrepreneurs.\n\nBusiness and product expansions into multiple regions within Africa.\n\nWhile these milestones are valid and deserve amplification, we cannot ignore the diversity elephant in our meeting rooms, tech conferences, pitch stages, and panel sessions. Funding received by female-owned startups is still significantly low compared to what their male counterparts receive from foreign and local investors. In this widely-read piece by Max Culliver and Africa: The Big Deal, they paint a gloomy picture of existing gender disparities within Africa\u2019s venture funding space. In 2021, 93% of the funding in Africa went to male-led startups \u2013 a pretty shocking figure by any standard.\n\nBut the news isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. This year alone, we\u2019ve seen more African female founders raise capital for their startups and get accepted into reputable accelerators like Techstars Toronto Accelerator (Techstars Toronto) and Y Combinator (YC). This article aims to recognize some African female founders making great strides across various industries and sectors on the continent.\n\nThis list comprises women who are mothers, advocates, readers, dancers, hikers, swimmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and so much more.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Peter Efosa Osakue hailed the Judiciary and its use of soft copies during the filing process which he noted was a new innovation. He informed that by the use of CD\u2019s the process was more dynamic by causing less stress to judges. He nonetheless called lawyers to be computer literate to cut down on turning in blank documents CD\u2019s to judges.\n\nGoing further, he called on the executives arm of government to grant financial autonomy to the judiciary to make it independent. He also sued for increased salaries and allowances for Judges.\n\nNBA Chairman, Pius Oiwor while speaking on irregularities bedeviling the judiciary touched on the issue of financial autonomy, which he said was guaranteed by the constitution. He said it was a concept that was most welcome, also needed in the legislature to make for ease of carrying out their constitutional roles.\n\nBarr. Douglas Ogbankwa called on the judiciary to walk the talk. They should apply technology in the arbitration of justice especially in the use of teleconferencing. He posited that there was no reason why the courts couldn\u2019t have zoom trials for instance, in this time and age, where there is use of advanced technology. Making reference to the valedictory speech of Hon. Justice Esther Amenaghanwon Edigin, he quoted, \u201cLet the executive take the nail from the neck of the judiciary so that it can breath.\u201d\n\nHe said the judiciary should do more and stop ruling against itself when suits concerning the autonomy of the judiciary come up for hearing.\n\nIt is worthy of note that most lawyers unanimously sued for an amendment of the filing process, frowning at shouldering costs for filing of judicial processes, documentation (kilo) and added burden of mobilizing bailiffs adequately for optimal service delivery.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Today, this 3.6km road is being constructed by Saro Africa from the tax credit which the company should have paid.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIt\u2019s a very innovative finance method; the first to be used by a state government in Nigeria. The federal government does tax credit for big, large corporate organizations but here, we, as a state, have been able to attract an investor and used his tax credit to enhance infrastructural development in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are lucky in the state because we have an investor and partner like Saro Africa who believes in Africa, Nigeria, and in our state. These projects were conceptualized about five years ago but construction could not commence until last year due to various challenges.\u201d\n\nObaseki said the project is important because the raw materials to be used can be sourced locally and hundreds of people will be employed.\n\nChief Executive Officer of Saro Group of Companies, Mr. Rasheed Sarumi said the integrated agricultural project is a joint venture between Saroafrica and Mohinani Group under the Green Hills Agric Projects.\n\nHailing the government for creating a business-friendly environment, Sarumi noted that the factory will be commissioned in quarter one, 2023.\n\nMr. Sarumi said the project is valued at N24 billion.\n\n\u201cThis is an integrated agricultural project. This factory needs 480 tonnes of cassava per day and there are about 5,000 hectares of land to grow. Already 1,500 have been grown; 350 people from neighboring communities will work here on the feedstock alone. The 480 tonnes per day will be converted to waste for feedstock for the piggery,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAs the re-election campaign train of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola moved to Aiyedire, Iwo and Ola-Oluwa local government areas of Iwo federal constituency, the traditional rulers in the constituency, Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi; Olu of Ile-Ogbo, Oba Abeeb Adetoyese Agbajelola, and Olowu of Kuta, Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama have described the governor as perfect example of good governace going by the manner he has managed the state resources.\n\nThis is just as they reassured him of their commitments to ensure his return for second term.\n\nThe monarchs said the re-election of Oyetola remains their collective project and is non-negotiable, hence the need to vote massively to ensure his re-election.\n\nThe revered traditional rulers said Governor Oyetola has performed creditably well and that his return for a second term will be a pay back for his good governance in all sectors.\n\nSpeaking in his palace, Oluwo of Iwo Oba Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, said the performance of the governor within the three and a half years was enough reason to get him re-elected.\n\nOba Akanbi who described Iwo as the home of progressive politics in Yorubaland, said the town has never been disappointed for being loyal to progressive government.\n\n\u201cIn Iwo, we are known for progressive politics. Historically, here is the home of progressive politics. It is the home of the progressives and nothing can change it. Since the progressive party has been favouring us, we have no reason to do a volte face. We shall continue to remain in the progressive.\n\n\u201cThe President we have been yearning for is coming to us soon in the Progressives, so also the Governor of our choice. So, we remain resolute to this cause. I want to appeal to other traditional rulers in Iwo Federal Constituency to continue to remain resolute and support the progressive government. It is time to speak with our votes.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work in unison to retain Oyetola and ensure the victory of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the next year\u2019s general elections. As you can see, the results of the last governorship election was not too good. But I can assure you that now, it will be much better, particularly from Iwo land. We have 30 kings with 48 ruling houses with numerous chiefs. We can\u2019t find it difficult to speak to them. I want to assure you that by the grace of God that enthroned us, you will emerge.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking in his palace, Olowu of Kuta, Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama, said the Governor has worked for second term in view of his modest achievements in the last three and a half years.\n\nHe said: \u201cI see your visit as a formality because you have done excellently well to earn second term. Your re-election is our collective project. We don\u2019t need campaign because your good works have campaigned for you already.\n\n\u201cYou are a perfect example of the saying, \u2018one good turn deserves another.\u2019 We don\u2019t have any doubt that you will be returned and this can be attested to by the visible indices. You have used your managerial skills to take us to where we are today. All the awards you earned, you deserved them. We will do all possible to support you.\n\n\u201cWe have no other reason than to vote for you. Your administration has brought development, peace, stability, unity and progress. It is only an enemy of progress that will not vote for you. You have rekindled our hopes as traditional rulers. That is why we have traditional rulers across my domain here. They\u2019re for you.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you of our utmost support. Your first term has been very smooth, peaceful and successful. You can count on our support, your second term is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Olu of Ile-Ogbo, Oba Abeeb Adetoyese Agbajelola, said the monarchs were resolute to return the Governor for second term, saying he has done excellently well to merit it.\n\n\u201cWe have done the necessary things to ensure that you are returned. We have carried out necessary rites and by the grace of God, you will be re-elected. I can assure you that in my domain, we don\u2019t know any ther political party apart from APC. We will continue to support you and we will not renege on our promise to continue to support you.\n\n\u201cWe will not back out. It is your time and by the grace of God nobody will change it. It is only a self-seeking individual that will look for an alternative, because to us, there is no reason in changing a winning team, particularly one that has performed creditably well. If anyone is still going round to become this or that outside this that we know, he is either wasting his time or ready to waste his resources because your project is done deal\u201d, the monarch added.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd at the venues of the campaign, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola urged members of the party to come out in large number on July 16 to vote for him.\n\nOyetola who spoke briefly on some of the achievements of his administration in the last three and a half years said inspite the pocket of challenges being faced shortly after he came on board, yet he was able to surmount them and record great things.\n\nHe urged those who have not collected their Permanent Voter\u2019s Cards to do so as it remains the only power to vote for continuity and consolidation of good governance.",

Ejike Mbaka, has apologised to the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi, and his supporters over his Thursday\u2019s outburst against the former Anambra State governor.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t mean to malign the person of Obi while speaking about the latter\u2019s frugal lifestyle.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMbaka had declared that Obi will never be president of Nigeria because he is \u2018stingy\u2019 and except he repent.\n\nWhile the cleric\u2019s outburst had generated mixed reactions among Nigerians, the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, under whose jurisdiction Mbaka operates, however, outrightly condemned and dissociated the Diocese from what it called inflammatory political utterances of Mbaka against Obi.\n\nThe Diocese described the outburst of Mbaka against Obi as unbecoming and divisive.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement personally signed by Mbaka on Friday, he said he is a servant of God and his intention was not to malign Obi\u2019s image, but to pray for him.\n\n\u201cMay God\u2019s will be done in his life. I pray to God whom I serve to give our beloved people good and excellent leaders who will take care of them and lead them to the promised land.\n\n\u201cAnyone who God wishes to make our Leader is my choice. In this vein, I give my blessings to His Excellency Peter Obi and his supporters, I also give my blessings to the other candidates and their supporters whose intention is also to give Nigeria good leaders.\n\n\u201cIn any way, the supporters of Mr. Peter Obi feel offended by my utterances or however I was misunderstood by them, I ask for their understanding and forgiveness. As a servant of the Most High God, I pray that it shall be well with my people. I am an ardent supporter of Good Governance, Justice, Equity, Love, and Godliness.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to God for His unquantifiable and favorable blessings, miracles, love and life for the Adoration Ministry, Enugu, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI assure the people of God and Nigerians that I am praying for Good Governance and Good Leadership in this country and that God will give us leaders after His own Heart.\n\n\u201cAs it stands right now, it is obvious that Nigeria is passing through indescribable insecurity challenges, an inestimable unemployment crisis, massive corruption, heinous crimes, and unbearable suffering engendered by bad leadership.\n\n\u201cI bear with my fellow country men and women in whatever we are passing through in this trying time. I call on the adorers and the entire people of God to join hands in praying that God will deliver us from the plans of the devil and its wicked agents.\n\n\u201cAt this time our people are passing through the valleys of shadows of death (Ps23.4), I pray for peace, love, and anything that will bring blessings and favour to our people and to our suffering teaming youths. I will always stand with you in all your ordeals. God will take care of you and bless you miraculously for me.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to fight or malign Mr. Peter Obi. He is my friend and remains my friend and brother I love him and I wish him Success May God bless him and his good supporters. God\u2019s will be done in his political endeavors(Mk.14:36).\n\n\u201cThe followers of Peter Obi are the same youths I am praying for, sacrificing for, fighting for, speaking for, and working for their integral well-being. What the youths are passing through and their conditions give me sleepless nights. It is for this reason that I yearn for good governance and worthy leaders that will take care of them.\n\n\u201cWe are passing through indescribable, unbearable, and undeserved hardship in this country. I pray for Divine intervention.\n\nI am not in any political party but I support good people and good governance. Any good person that God can give us is my choice candidate.\n\n\u201d I am a servant of God; For the sake of peace, I ask for forgiveness in any way I am misunderstood. And to Peter Obi himself, I ask God to bless him and manifest his will in his life. When God says Yes, who can say No? And when God says No, who can say Yes?\n\n\u201cI bless Peter Obi and pray for him. I bless my dear fellow Adores and pray for them. I bless the people of God everywhere and I pray that it shall be well with you all.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of those who were gruesomely killed on Pentecost Sunday at St St. Francis Xavier parish Owo, Ondo State who are being buried today, there will be no all-night Adoration program today,17th June 2022.\n\n\u201cWe join the entire Catholic Church to mourn their demise. May their souls and the souls of the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in Perfect Peace. Amen.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, all adorers are asked to convene on Sunday 19th June 2022 for our usual 10 am Mass and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and Fellowship. Thank you and God bless you all,\u201d he stated.",

He is quite close to the presidential candidate and has been with him for a very long time,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is a very informed decision to put out his name.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision followed wide consultations and that the party needs a person from a region with a large voting population.\n\n\u201cI think what it is is that it was the decision of the presidential candidate after due diligence,\u201d the APC chieftain added.\n\nThe APC, it is believed is putting Kabiru as a placeholder to beat the deadline given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for presidential candidates to submit the names of their running mates.\n\nINEC had given a Friday, June 17th, deadline for the submission of the names.",

Thus, expectations are high, especially with regards to early deployment of poll officials and materials, logistics, election security and inclusivity, amongst others.\n\n\u201cSituation Room notes the assurances given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a transparent election and the Nigeria Police to provide adequate security to voters and poll officials professionally. Accordingly, the Situation Room, therefore, outlines its expectations for Ekiti state governorship,\u201d Ugochukwu said.\n\nCharges to INEC, security agencies\n\nUgochukwu said further that the Situation Room expected an improved administration and management of the 2022 Ekiti state governorship election and urged INEC to take steps to hold poll officials to account for any violation of its guidelines.\n\n\u201cSituation Room observed the smooth distribution of sensitive election 2 materials from INEC\u2019s state headquarters to Registration Area Centres (RACs) and Super RACs in some locations. Situation Room commends INEC\u2019s novel approach in 2 the logistics and early distribution of sensitive election materials two days to the Election Day.\n\n\u201cGiven that Ekiti state does not have any difficult terrain, Situation Room 3 expects an early deployment of materials and officials on election day. Situation Room will be holding INEC accountable for its commitment and assurances, and will look out specifically for the following on Saturday, June 18, 2022: Early distribution and deployment of personnel and materials, Timely opening of polls: Knowledge of election ad hoc staff, procedures by INEC voting procedures particularly the efficacy of the BVAS, Electronic transmission of polling unit results and upload to INEC Results Viewing Portal (Rey Portal), and Transparent Collation process.\n\n\u201cSituation Room notes the position of the Electoral Act 2022 and INEC\u2019s Guidelines for the conduct of elections regarding the mandatory use of the Bimodal Voter accreditation System (BVAS) and welcomes the Commission\u2019s assurance that the accreditation devices are properly 2 configured and ready for the election.\u201d\n\nUgochukwu also disclosed that during the group\u2019s interaction with the REC a few days back, he confirmed that a mock election was held across the three senatorial districts.\n\n\u201cThese assurances are particularly uplifting following the noticeable shortcomings of the devices during the Anambra state governorship election and recently conducted FCT area councils\u2019 elections. The functionality of the BVAS will therefore form a critical part of the Situation Room\u2019s observation of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cSituation Room expects to see polling officials properly apply the provisions in the INEC guidelines to support Persons with Disabilities with assistive materials during this election, especially as the Electoral Act 2022 now makes it mandatory for INEC to take reasonable steps to ensure that PWDs, special needs and vulnerable persons are assisted during voting and provided with suitable means of communication during polls.\n\n\u201cSituation Room calls on the Nigeria Police to enforce to the latter its operational guidelines for police officers on election duty. It is hoped that officers engaged in the governorship Election are properly trained on the guidelines and that all personnel will be identified by their name tags.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies deployed for the election must demonstrate their commitment to non-partisanship and ensure adequate security for the election, in a manner that does not allow or encourage violence to be used as a tool for vote suppression.\n\n\u201cWe further call on the Police Force to document evidence of violence and vote-buying in order to prosecute the perpetrators as well as share this information with INEC,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nThe Situation Room called on political parties participating in the election to conduct themselves in a manner that would be devoid of violence and restrain their supporters.\n\n\u201cIn this vein, Situation Room commends the political parties for their participation in the governorship debate, and the signing of the Peace Accord sends hope that they will abide by the principles of the Accord. Situation Room further calls on political 2 parties to do everything possible to avoid inducement of voters in any form and the propagation of fake news.\n\n\u2018The past governorship elections in 2014 and 2018 were fraught with widespread vote buying even popularising the term stomach infrastructure\u201d as a synonym for voter inducement.\u201d\n\nThe Situation Room also commended the indigenes for the high rate PVC collection and called on all eligible voters to go a step further by actually coming out en masse to peacefully exercise their civic responsibility on election day.\n\nIt also called on the residents to shun all forms of voter inducement and vote their conscience.\n\nINEC\u2019s directive\n\nMeanwhile, the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has appealed to the staffers of the Commission to uphold the code of conduct and display the usual sense of responsibility, professionalism and remain above board and firmly resist all forms of unethical behaviour.\n\nThe INEC boss also told his staff to always stick strictly to the Oath of Neutrality to which they had all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in them.\n\nYakubu, who gave the directive Thursday in a message preceding the election, urged the INEC staff to remember that the people of Ekiti state and indeed all Nigerians would be watching closely and waiting to see if the Commission would fulfil its promise made to them that only the voters would determine their next governor.\n\nHe said he confidently made the promise due to his strong belief in the commitment, efficiency and determination of all the staff to ensure a level-playing field in Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nProf Yakubu said further that from June 2021 when the timetable and schedule of activities were released for the Ekiti governorship election, the Commission had collectively implemented several activities and taken every step to guarantee a free, fair, credible and inclusive process to the Election Day.\n\nHe, however, said the Ekiti election would be historic because it would be the first governorship election to be conducted based on the provisions of the new Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe message read, \u201cFrom June 2021 when we released the timetable and schedule of activities for the Ekiti state governorship election, we have collectively implemented several activities and taken every step to guarantee a free, fair, credible, and inclusive process this Saturday, June 18, 2022.\n\n\u201cThis election is coming seven months after the successful conduct of the Anambra state governorship election in November 2021, but it will be historic because it will be the first governorship election to be conducted based on the provisions of the new Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cLet us remember that the people of Ekiti state and indeed all Nigerians will be watching us closely and waiting to see if we will fulfill our promise. They will observe the opening time of each of the 2,445 polling units in the state, the conduct of our staff, how you attend to voters and your attitude towards persons with disability.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\n\n\u201cYou must ensure that no political party or candidate is accorded any advantage over the other. We must also, always, stick strictly to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us.\u201d\n\nRestriction of movement\n\nIn a related development, the state Police Command has announced a restriction of vehicular movement in parts of the state from 12:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. Saturday, June 18, the date for the governorship election in the state.\n\nThe Command\u2019s spokesperson, ASP Sunday Abutu, said in a statement Friday in Ado-Ekiti that the restriction would be particularly along the entry and exit points to the state.\n\nAbutu said operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military as well as other security agencies had been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order.\n\nAccording to him, the development is to ensure that criminally-minded individuals do not infiltrate into the State and cause mayhem during, before and after the election.\n\nAbutu said the Command had mobilised all necessary assets in partnership with other security agencies to provide adequate security and ensure free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn view of the upcoming governorship election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Alikali, through the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG), Johnson Babatunde, who is the election security commander, has assured the public of the Force\u2019s readiness to perform its statutory duty of protecting lives and properties of law-abiding indigenes throughout the period of the election and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe Command called on everyone to support and cooperate with its operatives and ensure prompt report of any suspicious person or group of persons to the nearest Police Station or call the following numbers: \u2013 Joint Situation Room: 09021198809/07059119144; Control Room: 08062335577.\u201d\n\nNSCDC\u2019s action\n\nOn its part, the state\u2019s Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has released toll-free numbers for women, who might be victims of Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nAccording to the Command, the numbers are 08003003333, 080046837467.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 Acting Deputy Commandant-General (DCG) in-charge of NSCDC election operation, Haruna Muhammed, said although the state was adequately secured, it was important to ensure the rights of women are protected in politics.\n\nHe said the launch which was in collaboration with Balm in Gilead Foundation, USAID, United Nations and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) was a proactive measure to rescue probable election victims.\n\nMuhammed said the collaboration was a laudable effort in fulfilling part of the mandates of Corps\u2019s 2021 Gender Policy, adding that there was also an established N-alert security platform from the ministry of interior with three alert categories: See Something Say Something, Records and Election Monitoring.\n\nHe said NSCDC would continue to partner all organisations ready to ensure the security and rights of citizens are protected.\n\nNGO\u2019s mandate\n\nAlso, the executive director, Balm in Gilead Foundation, an NGO, Tumininu Adedeji, said the organisation had a mandate to support female survivors in times of violence.\n\n\u201cThis is because women are more at risk before, during and after elections. We have a mandate with the NDI to have a survival centre for stop Violence Against Women in Politics (VAWIP) campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have community mobilisers stationed across the state giving reports of what is going on in polling units,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said residents who would be unable to call by themselves due to several reasons could be interceded for by another, adding that the emergency toll-free numbers were available even after the elections for violence survivors.\n\nAdedeji advised citizens who were in the habit of attacking women during election processes to desist from such acts.\n\nNYSC\u2019s demands\n\nAlso, the director-general, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Muhammad Kaku Fadah, has charged corps members that would serve as electoral officers to strictly abide by the electoral laws and \u201cavoid any action that can endanger\u201d their safety.\n\nHe warned all stakeholders in the election to prioritise the safety of all corps members participating in the election.\n\nA statement issued by the director, press and public relations of the Scheme, Mr. Eddy Megwa, also indicated that Gen. Fadah visited stakeholders in order to seek adequate protection for the corps members before, during and after the election.\n\n\u201cCorps members participating in the exercise have been trained by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to function as polling officers across the 16 local government areas of the state in the governorship election to be held on Saturday, June 18, 2022.\n\n\u201cBefore now, the corps members had been inducted into the dos and don\u2019ts of the electoral process that would make the exercise a huge success.\n\n\u201cThis is a fall-out of the constant interaction between the NYSC Ekiti state secretariat and INEC, which are critical stakeholders in ensuring free, fair and credible elections in the country.\n\n\u201cBefore now, the involvement of corps members in elections in the country have added credibility to the electoral process, which has been commended by local and foreign observers at different times,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",
          "summary": "\u201cThis governorship election is the first election to be conducted following the enactment of a new electoral law.\nThus, expectations are high, especially with regards to early deployment of poll officials and materials, logistics, election security and inclusivity, amongst others.\nAccordingly, the Situation Room, therefore, outlines its expectations for Ekiti state governorship,\u201d Ugochukwu said.\n\u201cGiven that Ekiti state does not have any difficult terrain, Situation Room 3 expects an early deployment of materials and officials on election day.\n\u201cThese assurances are particularly uplifting following the noticeable shortcomings of the devices during the Anambra state governorship election and recently conducted FCT area councils\u2019 elections.",

          "text": "Following heavy bombardments from many Nigerians who unleashed condemnation on him over his negative comments against the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), Enugu, Reverend Father Ejike Mbaka, has tendered apology\n\nIn a statement, he personally signed Mbaka, whose outing was quickly denounced by the Catholic Diocese of Enugu, came out with a distraction, saying he might have been misunderstood as he did not mean to undermine the former Governor of Anambra State.\n\nThe statement, read: \u201cI am grateful to God for His unquantifiable and favorable blessings,miracles,love and life for the Adoration Ministry, Enugu,Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI assure the people of God and Nigerians that I am praying for Good Governanace and Good Leadership in this country and that God will give us leaders after His own Heart.\n\n\u201cAs it stands right now, it is obvious that Nigeria is passing through an indescribable insecurity, inestimable unemployment, massive corruption, heinous crimes and unbearable suffering engendered by bad leadership. I bear with my fellow country men and women in whatever we are passing through in this trying time. I call on the adorers and the entire people of God to join hands in praying that God will deliver us from the plans of the devil and its wicked agents.\n\n\u201cI am a servant of God and my intention is not to malign His Excellency, Peter Obi\u2019s image, but to pray for him. May God\u2019s will be done in his life. I pray to God whom I serve to give our beloved people good and excellent leaders who will take care of them and lead them to the promised land.\n\n\u201cAnyone who God wishes to make our Leader is my choice. In this vein, I give my blessings to the supporters of His Excellency Peter Obi. In any way they feel offended by my utterances or however I was misunderstood by them, I ask for their understanding and forgiveness. As a servant of the Most High God, I pray that it shall be well with my people. I am an ardent supporter of Good Governance, Justice, Equity,Love and Godliness.\n\n\u201cAt this time our people are passing through the valleys of shadows of death(Ps23.4),I pray for peace , love and anything that will bring blessings and favour to our people and to our suffering teaming youths. I will always stand with you in all your ordeals. God will take care of you and bless you miraculously for me.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to fight or malign Mr Obi. May God bless him and his good supporters. God\u2019s will be done in his political endeavors(Mk.14:36)\n\n\u201cThe followers of Peter Obi are the same youths I am praying for, sacrificing for, fighting for, speaking for and working for their integral well being. What the youths are passing through and their conditions give me sleepless nights. It is for this reason that I yearn for good governance and worthy leaders that will take care of them. We are passing through indescribable ,unbearable and undeserved hardship in this country.\n\n\u201cI pray for Divine intervention. I am not in any political party but I support good people and good governance. Any good person that God can give us is my choice candidate. I am a servant of God; For the sake of peace, I ask for forgiveness in any way I am misunderstood. And to Peter Obi himself, I ask God to bless him and manifest his will in his life. When God says Yes, who can say No? And when God says No, who can say Yes? I bless Peter Obi and pray for him. I bless my dear fellow Adorers and pray for them. I bless the people of God everywhere and I pray that it shall be well with you all.\n\n\u201cFor some Spiritual reasons, there will be no all night Adoration program today, 17th June 2022. Meanwhile all adores are asked to convene on Sunday 19th June 2022 for our usual 10 am Mass and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and Fellowship.Thank you and God bless you all.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

          "text": "Chief Edwin Clark and Ayo Adebanjo have criticised Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for accepting to run with Atiku Abubakar in the 2023 presidential elections, describing him as \u201ca traitor.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesmen made the comment under the aegis of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, they said it was \u201cunspeakable and quite disappointing\u201d that Okowa accepted the Vice Presidency nomination after it had been agreed, by Southern Governors, for the position of President to be zoned to the southern region.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018PDP Needs To Return To Power\u2019, Okowa Accepts Atiku\u2019s VP Nomination\n\nOthers who signed the statement include President-General, Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus and President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Ambassador (Prof.) George Obiozor.\n\nClark is the leader of the Pan-Niger Delta Forum while Adebanjo heads the Yoruba group, Afenifere.\n\nPresidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday had announced Okowa as his running mate.\n\nSee their full statement below:\n\nATIKU\u2019S VP NOMINATION: YOU ARE A TRAITOR, SOUTHERN, MIDDLE BELT LEADERS BERATE GOVERNOR OKOWA\n\nSTATEMENT BY SOUTHERN & MIDDLE BELT LEADERS\u2019 FORUM, SMBLF (17-06-2022)\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) has berated the Governor of Delta State, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa for accepting his nomination as Vice Presidential Candidate to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Presidential Candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. It is unspeakable and quite disappointing that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who is currently Chairman of the South-South Governors\u2019 Forum, and a native of Owa-Alero in Ika North-East Local Government Area (one of the Igbo-speaking areas) of Delta State, would exhibit such barefaced unreliability.\n\nIt bears recalling that the 17 Governors of the Southern States of Nigeria, both of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), under the Chairmanship of the Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, met in Asaba, the capital of Delta State on May 11, 2021, and took far-reaching decisions, including that, based on the principles of fairness, equity and justice, the presidency should rotate to the south, at the end of the statutory eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure. And this very Governor Okowa was the host of that historic meeting. The Southern Governors later met again in Lagos, on July 5, where they reaffirmed their decision, and again in Enugu, on September 16, to restate the call that the presidency should rotate to the south in 2023.\n\nIt is essential to underline that the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), applauded the meeting of the governors, given its significant representation and the gravity of the outcome; we followed up and issued a similar statement after our meeting in Abuja on the 30th of May 2021, asking that the presidency should rotate to the south. And went further, on several other occasions, to caution political stakeholders from the South, including serving and former governors, ministers, senators, etcetera, not to, on any account, allow themselves to be appointed or nominated as running mate to any presidential candidate, if the presidency is not zoned to the south and that we will work against such person or persons.\n\nIt is, therefore, most unfortunate that the Governor of Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa who should know better, accepted his appointment as running mate to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. We do not have anything personal against Ifeanyi Okowo but his action is treacherous and tantamount to a despicable pawning of the political future of the people of Southern Nigeria.\n\nSadly, it is also now common knowledge that he spent resources belonging to the government and people of Delta state, to lobby for the position, extensively. And that explains why he never made any statement when his party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), thoughtlessly jettisoned the zoning principle, which has become established as a norm and an intrinsic part of the political trajectory.\n\nIt is difficult to fathom how a political party can claim to be on a supposed \u201crescue mission\u201d with such false footings of unfairness, injustice, duplicity and gross insensitivity to national outlook.\n\nIt is regrettable that while most of Governor Okowa\u2019s southern and northern counterparts have maintained gallant, patriotic deference to the unity and peace of the country, above blinkered political considerations, by their resolute stance on the rotation of the presidency to the south in 2023, Governor Ifeanyi Okiwa, the Chairman of the South-South Governors\u2019 Forum, of all people, would gullibly and slavishly capitulated to the bonbon of absurdity. Thus, acceding to a situation whereby, one person rules for eight years and hands over to another of his stock, in a country of at least 360 ethnic groups. What a shame!\n\nThe people of southern Nigeria chimed at Asaba, Lagos, Enugu, Uyo, Port Harcourt, Umuahia, and Abuja, continuously on the zoning of the presidency and that another northern presidency after the eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari would be injurious to the unity and peace of the country.\n\nGovernor Okowa has, by his action, betrayed the trust reposed on him by his colleagues; the southern governors, the entire good people of southern Nigeria and all well-meaning Nigerians. He has made himself persona non grata, not only, with SMBLF but all citizens who treasure our oneness and hopes of a more united and peaceful Nigeria.\n\nWe, therefore, reject Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and his Vice Presidency, and leave him to his lot, but let the world know that this is a betrayal of the highest order.\n\nAnd that this is not a matter of loyalty to one\u2019s political party, but rather a greedy, parochial and unpatriotic action, committed against the general interest of his State, Delta state, the Niger Delta region, and Southern Nigeria. It is, certainly, also not in the interest of the nation at large.\n\nWe commend the patriotism of all Nigerians who cherish our unity and progress as a country and further urge all such Nigerians; in the North and the South; young and mature, the high and mighty; irrespective of religion and tribe, to remain steadfast on the centrality of the presidency to rotating to the South in 2023, in the national interest.\n\nSigned:\n\nChief (Dr.) Edwin Kiagbodo Clark, OFR, CON\n\nLeader SMBLF/PANDEF\n\nChief Ayo Adebanjo\n\nLeader, Afenifere\n\nPogu Bitrus\n\nPresident-General, Middle Belt Forum\n\nAmbassador (Prof.) George Obiozor\n\nPresident-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide",
          "summary": "Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday had announced Okowa as his running mate.\nAnd this very Governor Okowa was the host of that historic meeting.\nIt is, therefore, most unfortunate that the Governor of Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa who should know better, accepted his appointment as running mate to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\nSadly, it is also now common knowledge that he spent resources belonging to the government and people of Delta state, to lobby for the position, extensively.\nGovernor Okowa has, by his action, betrayed the trust reposed on him by his colleagues; the southern governors, the entire good people of southern Nigeria and all well-meaning Nigerians.",

          "text": "The apex Igbo Socio-cultural, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has congratulated the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, describing him as a \u201cdetribalised patriot, purveyor of morals and a poster personality\u201d.\n\nWhile expressing optimism that his candidacy will add enormous electoral value to the PDP, Ohanaeze noted that in all of Okowa\u2019s political career, he had served without skirmishes.\n\nThe Igbo apex body stated this on Friday in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Dr Alex Ogbonnia, titled \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo congratulates Okowa as vice-presidential candidate\u201d.\n\nOgbonnia said that Professor George Obiozor led Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide is proud of him.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cthe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide heartily congratulates an Igbo prodigy; an astute administrator, sagacious politician, brilliant physician, creative visionary, prudent resource manager, detribalized patriot, purveyor of morals and a poster personality, His Excellency, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, the Governor of Delta State as he secures the highly coveted Vice Presidential candidacy of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo has watched with keen interest and admiration the phenomenal trajectory of an University of Ibadan trained medical doctor from the Secretary to Ika North East Local Government; Chairman, Ika North East Local Government; Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources; Commissioner for Water Resources Development; Commissioner for Health; Secretary to the Delta State Government; Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; ECOWAS Parliamentarian; Governor of Delta State and today the Vice Presidential Candidate of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cAvailable records indicate that from birth, God endowed Okowa with a special grace. It is only grace that explains the mystery behind the profound achievements by a few in various areas of life which paradoxically present enormous challenges to many others. Perhaps, this explains why Okowa ennobled the various offices he held with remarkable skill, exceptional diligence, elegance and panache.\n\n\u201cThe life of Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa is a veritable tribute to humility, sincerity, simplicity, hard work, perseverance and centrality of morals in the dynamics of power. As a governor, Okowa had a clear vision which he pursued with incandescent passion, valour, candour, honour and unassailable accomplishments.\n\n\u201cAbove all other enviable attributes, Okowa resonates as a team player, diverse ethnic manager with a friendly finesse and character comeliness. He is one of the few who has sustained in government without the elixir and grandeur delusion that has become the characteristics of many in positions of authority.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Okowa has served both as sub-ordinate, co-ordinate and super-ordinate to several persons without skirmishes. Dr Ifeanyi Okowa is a quintessential gentleman.\n\n\u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worlwide led by Ambassador Professor George Obiozor is very proud of you. We are optimistic that your candidacy will add enormous electoral value to your political party, the PDP.\u201d",
