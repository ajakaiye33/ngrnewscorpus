          "title": "Why I prefer prayers to N50,000 offered me after returning missing phone \u2013 Lagos okada rider",
          "text": "Tosin Adedokun, an NCE holder who rides commercial motorcycle popularly called okada, for a living in Lagos, tells OPEYEMI ADEFEMI how he rejected a monetary gift after returning a missing phone\n\nTell us a bit about yourself.\n\nMy name is Tosin Adedokun. I am from Isale Oyo in Oyo State and I am 28 years old.\n\nAre you married? Do you have children?\n\nI am not yet married and I don\u2019t have kids yet. My getting married is in the hand of God. I will (get married) when God says the time is right.\n\nWhen did you start riding okada?\n\nI started commercial motorcycle business since my secondary school days. This should be my twelfth year riding okada.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you further your education after secondary school?\n\nAfter secondary school, I did NCE but I have not been able to further because of financial constraint.\n\nHow much do you make daily operating okada?\n\nWhatever I make everyday depends on how God blesses me that day. Some days, I make N1,500 in the morning after all deductions, which include feeding and fuelling my machine. In the afternoon, if there is a church programme I will attend after which I will go back to my business. What I make daily depends on God.\n\nIs it true you found a misplaced phone and returned it to the owner?\n\nYes, it is true that I returned a missing phone to its owner.\n\nHow did you find the phone and what kind of phone was it?\n\nOn that day I was just working and going about my regular business. As I was scouting for passengers, I saw the phone on the ground. I picked it up; kept it in my pocket and got back to my work.\n\nHow did you locate the owner of the phone?\n\nThe phone had rung multiple times and I was not even aware because it was on silence. By the time I discovered it had been ringing, the owner\u2019s wife called and I told her that they shouldn\u2019t worry as the phone was in safe hands. So, she gave me the directions to her place of work and I promised her that I would bring the phone to her.\n\nWhat was the owner\u2019s reaction when you returned the phone?\n\nThe man was very surprised. He could not believe that someone would actually return a missing phone. Out of excitement the man offered me monetary gift.\n\nHow much did he offer you?\n\nHe offered me N50,000 cash but I rejected the money and requested that he should just pray for me instead because that is all I need. I rejected the money because if I collected the money, I would spend it all but I believe his prayers will be with me forever. I believe very much in prayers.\n\nDid anyone try to discourage you from returning the phone to the owner?\n\nWhile I was having the conversation with the owner on how to return the phone, a particular woman was with me and she asked me what the matter was, so I explained to her and she was so surprised that I wanted to return the phone. She commended me and said I was a nice man. Apart from her, no one else knew about the phone until it got to the owner.\n\nWas your decision to return the lost phone to its owner based on your religious belief?\n\nLet me just say that it is God that has been helping me. That would be the fourth missing phone that I would return to the owner. There was a particular woman that forgot her phone on my bike and I returned the phone. She was very surprised. There was a particular time I lost my phone too but the person who found it did not return it to me. However, I haven\u2019t let that discourage me from returning what does not belong to me to the rightful owners.\n\nDo you have any plan for further education?\n\nI once attempted to further after my NCE but I could not afford it. I just hope I will be able to save enough money to be able to further my education. Before that, I will need a job that will be enough to cater for me while in school and also cater for my parents and siblings as well.\n\nDo you plan to quit okada business?\n\nYes, I plan to do so when I get a job that offers me more money. Sometimes I cry in my room because if I want to marry how do I present myself to my in-laws as an okada rider? Will I be accepted? And will the business be able to cater for my wife? This has been one of my major concerns. I used to have a fish business until thieves entered my farm and stole all the fishes in my pond. I was even thinking that even if I cannot further my education, I should be able to learn a skill that offers more that I get from okada business.",

          "text": "The National Council for Arts and Culture ( NCAC) and the National Council for Women Society (NCWS) have reached an agreement to evolve a new brand that will empower vulnerable Nigerian women and create a platform that will enable them contribute their quota to national development.\n\nThis agreement was reached when the newly elected executive of the NCWS led by Hajia Lami Adamu paid a courtesy visit to NCAC headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHajia Lami Adamu commended the warm reception accorded her and her team. She said she was at the Council headquarters to introduce the newly inaugurated executive of the Women Society to the Director General, Otunba Runsewe who has been a pillar of support to the Women Society in areas of skills acquisition, capacity building and empowerment and also seek areas of further collaborations.\n\nShe stated that the newly inaugurated executive of the society is proud to identify with Otunba Runsewe who has positively projected the image of Nigeria home and abroad within the Culture and Tourism sector and is also working assiduously to transform Nigeria\u2019s rich and diverse cultural heritage into a viable economy.\n\nHajia Lami Adamu revealed that the new leadership of the NCWS has commenced the development of a strategic plan as a roadmap for achieving the vision of the council for the next 5 years. These according to her include Promoting women in leadership and Governance, Promoting economic empowerment of women, Child protection and girl child education and Building an effective and efficient NCWS as a valued partner for promoting the gender agenda.\n\nThe NCWS president therefore solicited for a strong collaboration with the NCAC to enable the women society achieve its lofty programmes and take vulnerable women off the streets.\n\nIn his response, the Director General, National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Segun Runsewe while congratulating Hajia Lami Adamu on her successful inauguration as the 15th President of the NCWS praised other executive members for their victories.\n\nRunsewe expressed delight over the visit which according to him will open new vistas for collaborations for the NCAC and NCWS to empower Nigerian women and fortify the future of the girl child.\n\nThe Director General decried the fast eroding cultural values in the society which has led to juvenile delinquencies and borrowed Western cultures.\n\n\u201cAs Women, the onus is on you to begin a campaign to rescue our youths and the girl child from the claws of westernization and alien cultures and inculcate in them good moral principles and the true Nigerian Culture\u201d he added.\n\nRunsewe who doubles as the President of the World Crafts Council, African Region urged the Women Society to make a bold statement and redouble their efforts in sensitizing mothers to be mindful of the schools they send their children as a high percentage of immorality, rape cases and gender based crimes originate from the school environment.\n\nThe Director General reiterated the urgent need for the new leadership to hit the ground running given the onerous task ahead of them and promised to keep his doors open for collaborations and necessary support to make the NCWS achieve its desired objective.\n\nHe announced that the NCAC and the NCWS will midwife a brand that will empower vulnerable women and build capacity among them.",

          "text": "By Chinedu Adonu\n\nThe Igbo Youth Council, IYC, has again waded into the raging controversy over the detention of former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and his wife Beatrice.\n\nIt was reported that the couple are being held in the UK for charges bothering on alleged organ harvesting.\n\nThe group had earlier pleaded for caution and an end to the social media trail of the Senator.\n\nThe group has now written an open letter to the UK Embassy, begging that at least the Senator\u2019s wife be freed to enable her attend to their ailing daughter.\n\nIn the appeal made available to journalists on Sunday, the group said it was now clear that the Ekweremadus did not involve themselves in any untoward deal but had followed an established process to save the life of their daughter.\n\nThe letter of appeal was signed by Igbo Youths President-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike and the Secretary-General, Comrade Obinna Achionye.\n\n\u201cFollowing more emerging revelations in the case involving the former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, both true son and daughter of Igbo land, we find it expedient to make this open appeal to the UK Embassy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cContrary to earlier reports which flooded the media, it has become clear that the couple had no bad intention in mind.\n\n\u201cHaving seen that they had no other intention rather than to save the life of their daughter, as nobody will sit by and watch their child die without making efforts, we deemed it necessary to make this appeal.\n\n\u201cWe plead with the United Kingdom, through its Embassy here in Nigeria, to look into the implication of detaining the husband and the wife. We appeal for the release of one of them so the person can take care of the sick child who needs medical help urgently,\u201d the group wrote.\n\nThey also slammed fifth columnists who they said had gone on to create pseudo accounts with the name of the alleged victim of organ harvesting, David Nwamini.\n\nIYC said, \u201cwe observed that within the last 48 hours, no less than five fake Facebook accounts have been created with the profile of the alleged victim.\n\n\u201cThis is no doubt the work of blackmailers as they have gone ahead to be making posts with the said unverified accounts. The posts contain spurious claims and allegations which are clearly the handiwork of political enemies, all aimed at bringing the Senator down.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of time and the identity of those behind this shall be unveiled if they fail to desist from their evil antics.\n\n\u201cThey had earlier claimed that the boy in question is 15 years, but current revelations have proved otherwise. This is why we call for a thorough investigation.\n\n\u201cWe urge the general public to discountenance those posts as the truth will surely prevail and Senator Ike Ekweremadu and the wife will come out of these allegations with their reputation unscathed.\u201d",

Elections have never been contested and won on the platter of fairness, credibility and acceptability rather it had been manipulated to favour a party who is second to none in plundering the commonwealth of the people. DSP Omo -Agege shall win a landslide come 2023 gubernatorial election. I call on the people to rally support for all candidates of the umbrella Party,\u201d Chief Oyibode concluded.",

          "title": "Obasanjo: I made mistake picking Atiku as vice president The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "A fresh battle appears to be brewing between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nObasanjo, in a scathing remark yesterday, said he made a mistake picking Atiku as his running mate for the 1999 election.\n\nHe said it was one of the many genuine mistakes he has made in the course of his public life.\n\n\u201cOne of the mistakes I made was picking my Number Two when I wanted to become the president,\u201d Obasanjo told students from select secondary school students that participated in the final of the National Exhibition and Awards organised by Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship (SAGE) in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut because it was a genuine mistake, God saved me.\u201d\n\nAlthough the former president did not mention his former right-hand man by name in the statement, Atiku was his running mate in that election and that of 2003 before their relationship went sour.\n\nAnother costly mistake Obasanjo said he made, was not taking seriously a warning he got from an American ambassador that the late military head of state, General Sani Abacha, was planning to arrest him.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen Abacha wanted to arrest me, I was told by the American ambassador that they would arrest me and that America had asked that I should be given an asylum.\n\n\u201cI said no. It could have been a mistake because I could have lost my life.\n\n\u201cI will say there are many things that could have been a mistake but God saved me from them all.\u201d\n\nHe wondered how Nigerian youths could assume leadership positions in various cadres of governance when those contesting elective offices in the forthcoming 2023 general elections are largely septuagenarians.\n\n\u201cAnother thing inhibiting the youth from running is the amount of money involved in going into politics. I hope that things should not continue like this.\n\n\u201cI was 39 years old when I became the military head of state.\n\n\u201cTwenty years later, I came back as civilian president, but those there now do not want to allow the youths.\n\n\u201cIf things continue like this, I do not know how you can come in,\u201d he said.\n\nOn religious tolerance, he advised the youth not to see their own religion as superior to that of another person.\n\nObasanjo said: \u201cI have no right to say what another man believes in is inferior to mine.\n\n\u201cIf God had wanted all of us to be of the same religion, he would have made it so. And since He did not make it so, no person should attempt to make it so.\n\n\u201cYoung people should learn at a very early age in life that if there are five religions in the world, that is how God wants it to be. If there are 10, that is how God wants it. All religions originated from the same source.\n\n\u201cIf you are a Muslim and you do not live the way God wants you to live, you cannot enter Aljannah (Paradise). If you are a Christian and you do not live the way God wants you to live, the same thing, you will not enter Paradise.\n\n\u201cIf the basis of religion is doing the right thing for the benefits of mankind, you don\u2019t have to condemn any person because of what he believed.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any religion is superior to mine, and I don\u2019t believe that mine is superior to another person\u2019s belief.\n\n\u201cI will not allow any person to cast aspersions on my religion and will not do same to another person. Practice your religion the way God wants you to do it and don\u2019t condemn another person.\u201d\n\nObasanjo had in an earlier brutal assessment of Atiku, said he would not have had any second thought making Atiku his successor if he had \u201cbeen a loyal, faithful, dutiful and committed second-in-command.\u201d\n\nRecalling how he settled for Atiku as his running mate in the 1999 election, the former president said: \u201dI considered all candidates that were available and what I knew about them. I had earlier collected information about some to beef up my knowledge of them.\n\n\u201cThat night, I settled for Atiku Abubakar. Some of the reasons were: he worked hard for the project; he never indicated interest in the job to me; he had worked closely with Shehu Yar\u2019Adua and Shehu never passed any adverse comment on him; he had been elected as a governor, which already put him on the pedestal to move up politically, but he had been short-changed in the election that would have put M.K.O. Abiola in power, and he seemed to have some national outreach.\u201d\n\nStill on his assessment of Atiku, Obasanjo in his memoirs, My Watch, said: \u201cFor instance, until later, when a distinguished chief from Bauchi pointed out to me the value of pedigree queried Atiku\u2019s pedigree and blamed me for making a wrong choice.\n\n\u201cI did not pay attention to Atiku\u2019s parental background. Furthermore, until all efforts to help Atiku change had failed \u2013 having stumbled upon a report of inquiry carried out on him \u2013 I asked one of my predecessors why he did not inform me of how bad the report was and he said that he thought I knew.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThis was a man I wanted to dismiss and jail but for the intervention of Shagaya and Shehu Yar\u2019Adua. I took him at face value.\n\n\u201cHowever, if his appointment was an error, I fully accepted responsibility for the genuine mistake.\n\n\u201cAnd knowing all that I discovered about him, what would have been an unpardonable mistake and sin against God would have been to foist him on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMy mistake was containable and it was contained\u2026\n\n\u201cAs I moved on with my programmes for the second term, I had no clear indication about who would succeed me.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku had been a loyal, faithful, dutiful and committed second-in-command, I would not have doubted. After all, I picked him purposely for that in mind.\n\n\u201cWhat informed my position was the question my Chaplain, Rev. (Dr.) William Okoye, asked in the beginning of May 2006 about who I had anointed to succeed me, since we were almost one year away to the election. I told him no one yet. He was curious but he believed me.\n\n\u201cWe moved on as all sorts of clouds started to gather around Atiku if not at home, surely in the US, with his newly acquired wife to complete his total Nigerian husband outlook. \u2013 Yoruba, Hausa, Fulani and Igbo wives. Here, he achieved Federal character.\n\n\u201cIn addition, he acquired indiscriminately chieftaincy titles all over the country.\n\n\u201cBy 30 May, I told Revd. Okoye at a morning devotion session in my residence that I wanted to embark on one month fasting and praying in June for God to show us (PDP) how to proceed in getting a successor candidate. He joined me in the fasting and prayer with some other members of the Red Carpet Prayer Group.\n\n\u201cWithin three weeks of our fasting and praying, we received a letter dated 22 June, 2006 written by the US Department of Criminal Justice Office of International Affairs, which was brought to me by Nuhu Ribadu, the Head of EFCC, requesting us to investigate a number of Nigerians for suspicion of criminal activities in the US.\n\n\u201cAtiku Abubakar\u2019s name was among the names sent to us. Up to that time, EFCC had enjoyed a close cooperation and collaboration with law enforcement agencies in the UK and the USA.\n\n\u201cI gave the green light to Nuhu for the investigation as requested by the US Authorities. He carried out the investigation and forwarded his report to the US. The report was a bit uncomfortable and unsavoury for Atiku and his associates.\n\n\u201cI thought it was bad enough that the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was under investigation for corruption, when my Administration had made fighting corruption one of its cardinal objectives.\n\n\u201cAs it turned out, the investigation in Nigeria and in the US led to Atiku\u2019s house being searched by the US Bureau of investigation (FBI), the arrest and detention of his newly married wife, Jennifer.\n\n\u201cShe was also declared wanted at one time. It was so embarrassing for our Administration and Embassy in Washington under Ambassador George Obiozor.\n\n\u201cI believed that Atiku, for reasons not unconnected with the investigation, ceased from going to the US and put up his expensive house in an exclusive area of Washington DC for sale.\n\n\u201cHe bought the house early in our administration, and I blamed him for his poor judgement, though he tried to justify it by saying that he sold a smaller one to buy a bigger one; all the same, the timing was wrong. Congressman Jefferson eventually went to jail.\n\n\u201cWhat that request for investigation from the US did was start a process of elimination in the transition process. Since Atiku did not raise or discuss any issue concerning his matter in America with me except what I read in the local and foreign newspapers and reports, I did not ask him about anything.\n\n\u201cBy then, I had come to know Atiku for his connivance in covering up and not being straightforward on matters requiring truth and candour.\n\n\u201cOn a number of occasions, I had told him to his face that I saw him differently from Shehu Yar\u2019Adua, who was partly his political mentor and my second-in-Command during my military administration.\n\n\u201cShehu would never lie to me. Atiku would look at me in the face and say no when the answer should be yes. I found it curious and inexplicable.\n\n\u201cAfter I had confronted him on a number of occasions, inviting my Chief of Staff, Abdul Mohammed, to witness by joining the two of us to iron out some of his dubious actions; after I reported him to his father-n-law, the Lamido of Adamawa, I gave up on him.\n\n\u201cHe believed that denigrating me with his battery of media men and women was the surest way to succeeding me. I wished him well and moved on.\n\n\u201cSometime in the fourth quarter of 2004, an associate of Atiku came to my residence at the Aso Villa from Atiku\u2019s official residence. He felt uncomfortable and I tried to make him feel at ease.\n\n\u201cThen, he settled to tell me the story of what had just transpired in Atiku\u2019s residence. I listened with rapt attention.\n\n\u201cHe went on to say that Atiku told him that for him to become the President of Nigeria, the 2007 elections were only a formality.\n\n\u201cThe seven ingredients he needed for his enthronement were already in his hands. He controlled the National Assembly because both the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives were in his pocket. He controlled twenty-eight out of thirty-six governors. He had control of the media. His influence over the judiciary was overwhelming.\n\n\u201cWhat he needed was foreign endorsement, and for that, he had employed two lobby groups in the US and one in the UK. And finally, the money for the elections was in the purse.\n\n\u201cWhen the man finished, I thanked him without passing any comment. The man was surprised at my reaction and asked, \u2018You have nothing to say to these?\u2019\n\n\u201cI said I had nothing to say, and I immediately called my ADC, Chris Jemilola, to play a game of squash with me.\n\n\u201cOn our way to the squash court with my ADC, I said, \u2018People at times make plans and leave God out of their plans.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy casual remark struck Chris and he said, \u2018Sir, that was a profound statement.\u2019 I said that I made the statement because of what I had just heard of Atiku\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cI was not convinced he had put God in his plans. Atiku was confident and God was laughing.\n\n\u201cMost of Atiku\u2019s ingredients soon started to fall out of place one by one.\n\n\u201cThe first was the party, PDP. He thought I was powerless and had no clue about the execution of his plan with his group; part of his attack on me was for National Chairman of the Party to give the first salvo, then other things would follow as his grip on the Party would be firm and consolidated.\n\n\u201cThat salvo came in the form of a letter to me from the Chairman of the party, Audu Ogbeh, who had fully defected with Ayu to Atiku.\n\n\u201cThe letter, which was not the product of any issue or matter discussed with or at any party meeting, came suddenly.\n\n\u201cWhen I received it, I could read the sinister intention behind it. And I told Remi Oyo, my media person, that the letter would be out in the media within the couple of days. Remi doubted it would happen.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, I spent that night writing my reply, and I sent it in the morning.\n\n\u201cMy reply was clear. I wondered why Atiku and his group did not realise that with my reply, the battle line was clear or maybe they thought that the seven ingredients would remain intact to the end.\u201d\n\nHow political parties can substitute vice-presidential candidates \u2013INEC\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has clarified the conditions under which the political parties can substitute candidates whose names have been forwarded to it.\n\nSpeaking against the background of the debate over the right of the parties to remove and replace the names of candidates, INEC National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, said on Friday that the parties can make substitution if the nominated candidate dies or if the nominated candidate withdraws from the race.\n\nFielding questions on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, Okoye said: \u201cThe issue of withdrawal is at the absolute discretion of the duly nominated candidate and no one else.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cAs far as the law is concerned and as far as the commission is concerned, the commission makes it mandatory that the moment a presidential candidate emerges, such a presidential candidate must nominate an associate who shall run with him/her as a vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201dAnd so, both are seen as Siamese twins; they move together, and they fall together.\n\n\u201cIn the forms submitted by the various political parties, they submitted forms relating to their presidential candidates and they also submitted forms relating to their vice-presidential presidential candidates, and that is in compliance with the provisions of the constitution and in compliance with the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cThere is a provision in the Electoral Act for withdrawal of candidates validly nominated and the law provides that a political party cannot substitute a candidate that has been validly nominated except in two instances; if the nominated candidate dies or if the nominated candidate withdraws from the race.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of withdrawal, the nominated candidate shall \u2013 in his own writing \u2013 write a letter to the political party that nominated him, indicating that he has withdrawn from the race and that must also be accompanied by an affidavit duly sworn to by the said candidate.\n\n\u201cThen the political party that nominated the candidate will now forward same to the Independent National Electoral Commission, saying that our presidential candidate has withdrawn, or our vice-presidential candidate has withdrawn, and these are the documents of withdrawal and this is the person we are using to replace.\n\n\u201cBut as of today, the political parties nominated their presidential candidates and nominated their vice-presidential candidates, so the issue of withdrawal is at the absolute discretion of the duly nominated candidate and no one else.\u201d",
          "summary": "A fresh battle appears to be brewing between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\nObasanjo, in a scathing remark yesterday, said he made a mistake picking Atiku as his running mate for the 1999 election.\n\u201cTwenty years later, I came back as civilian president, but those there now do not want to allow the youths.\n\u201cHe went on to say that Atiku told him that for him to become the President of Nigeria, the 2007 elections were only a formality.\n\u201cBut as of today, the political parties nominated their presidential candidates and nominated their vice-presidential candidates, so the issue of withdrawal is at the absolute discretion of the duly nominated candidate and no one else.\u201d",

Nobody should think that he has monopoly of violence. That we are peaceful does not mean that we are weak or senseless.\n\n\u201cMr Peter Obi as a bonafide citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and born in Nigeria has the Constitutional right to contest for any political office he deems fit and nobody can stop that.\n\n\u201cObi is a successful man is all sense of the word. He agreed to contest for the office of the president of Nigeria not because he needs anything from the said office, but he made himself available because of the call on him by Nigerians who want to salvage our dear nation from collapse both economically, educationally and security-wise.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks he wants to attack such a peaceful and fulfilled man is sick and his sickness will be treated appropriately at the right time.\n\n\u201cOnly a wicked and idiotic person will be comfortable with the current state of the nation . Our country is in dire need of a drastic change that will turn things for good and some people are plotting to make matters worse because of their so-called conquest.\n\n\u201cWe call on those who know these criminals and their sponsors to warn them to remove the hands of the monkey from the cooking pot before it turns to the hands of a human being.\n\n\u201cWe want these criminals to know that even a mad man is owned by some people and if you touch him believing as a mad man roaming on the street that he has nobody, the real owners will come out to defend him.\n\n\u201cSince after the kidnap and release of the Methodist Prelate, His Eminence, Rev. Samuel Kanu at Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State, more innocent people have been kidnapped and some killed despite the presence of the military in that area. These smacks of a collaboration with these criminals and conspiracy.\n\n\u201cWe call on the security agencies to immensely move into action and arrest the real criminals plotting to assassinate Mr Peter Obi just because he answered the call of Nigerians to contest for the office of the president which he is eminently qualified to do so. Enough is enough.\u201d",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nNollywood actress, Chigozie Stephanie Alichi aka Chizzy Alichi-Mbah is not scared of husband snatchers.\n\nIn this chat, the movie star reveals reasons why no woman can dare take her man. She also shed more lights on her upcoming kids show and why she rejected many wealthy suitors before meeting and finally marrying her husband. Here are excerpts:\n\nHow has it been shuttling between Lagos and Asaba for movies?\n\nIt\u2019s not that hard because I have a supportive husband. He comes around sometimes when he is free and of course, there is a functioning airport in Asaba. I can easily breeze in and out. Although, right now, I want to stay more in Lagos, make more contacts, do more movies and focus more on my show.\n\nWhat does it take to maintain a happy marriage?\n\nMaintaining a happy home starts from the person you got married to. I had many suitors, people richer than my husband but I chose my husband because he is my best friend, my play and gossip mate. He\u2019s rich of course. He is somebody I have known because I learnt that in marriage, sometimes love vanishes and friendship sustains; secondly, he supports my dream. Some of my colleagues stopped acting as soon as they got married, but my case is different. In fact, I became a producer after marriage and I started a TV show because of him. So, my husband is my best friend and he always wants to see me happy and vice versa. And to me, that\u2019s how to maintain a happy marriage.\n\nBut you have made your husband stay off social media?\n\nI didn\u2019t, he is not a social media person. In fact, I am the one that brought him out. He is a quiet and reserved person. He\u2019s very simple, calm and calculated.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a social media account, are you scared of husband snatchers?\n\nYes, my husband doesn\u2019t have a social media account. He is only on Facebook, and no, I am not scared of husband snatchers. I mean who will snatch my husband? She carry 10 heads? I am a whole package and my husband is forever grateful. He is the one scared of losing me.\n\nSince Korra Obidi\u2019s marital issues, some celebrities have stopped posting their happy moments on social media; did her marriage crash affect you too?\n\nNot at all, they have issue obviously. Their marriage didn\u2019t crash because of online show off. Although, too much of everything, is bad. Marriage wey go last go last, whether you show off online or not.\n\nCan you forgive and take back a cheating partner?\n\nI have this orientation while growing up that all men cheat, men are polygamous in nature. And believe it or not, most men cheat. Though, there are still good ones and my husband is number one. If you leave a cheating partner, what is the possibility that the next person will not cheat? To me, it depends on what and how it happened.\n\nDoes your relationship status affect the kind of roles you accept?\n\nKind of, because even if my husband does not complain, my fans will be like \u2018she is married, why is she doing this?\u2019 And even, when I am doing some kind of roles like the \u2018sexy girl\u2019, I can\u2019t expose too much. You can cover or wear classy clothes and still be very sexy.\n\nHow about kissing scenes?\n\nDeep kiss? No!\n\nTell us more about your show. What inspired it?\n\nIt\u2019s divine. The inspiration came when I was cooking rice on a Sunday. I told my husband about it. He said I should give him few days to think about it, and boom, he said it\u2019s wonderful. We bought equipment, set up our stage and by God\u2019s grace, it would soon be airing on Africa Magic. It\u2019s a children\u2019s reality TV show (The Xperience) unscripted.\n\nWhat are the things kids will learn after watching the show?\n\nBoth children and adult will learn a lot. It will carry everybody along. It will also bring peace to most homes. Children are smart and they know everything; because it\u2019s unscripted, they open up as it is, and their parents always make amends after hearing them out. For instance, a child said his father is always angry and shouting, of course the father won\u2019t shout again. He will make amends after hearing from the son.\n\nIt seems you\u2019re a lover of kids, how many do you plan to have?\n\nYes, I am. I want to have five children and they are coming soon by God\u2019s grace. We are finally ready.\n\nYou intentionally didn\u2019t want to have kids immediately after marriage?\n\nIt\u2019s personal.\n\nWould you allow your child join the movie industry if he or she expresses interest?\n\nOf course, the movie industry is a great industry. I will gladly show my full support.\n\nWhat\u2019s your current relationship with Zubby Michael after the social media clash?\n\nWe are good now. We met at the airport and hugged it out.\n\nWhat are the three things about your husband that makes you love him specially?\n\nHe is very smart, calculative and intelligent. He is also quite simple and a selfless man, loving and caring. He caries me like an egg.\n\nDespite being married, do men still run after you?\n\nYes, as long as you are a pretty woman, men will always come around, including admirers and some wishing they married you instead.",

They will use their voice to inspire these young people to be huge contributors to the Nigerian economy and Africa as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe believe the young generation we have today has to be part of the movement for a better economy. We must also create huge awareness for them to participate in politics and governance for us to have good government in Africa and in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor you to participate in politics, you need good education to go into the labour market and to contribute to the economy so that we can have a better and secure society.\u201d\n\nTemofe said AEMA was poised to advocate for youth inclusion in the country\u2019s economy through its series of developmental programmes.\n\nHe explained that the African Economic Merit Awards aims to boost economic growth in African communities by uniting the successful business entrepreneurs with the latent talents.\n\nThe organisation, he said, works towards giving hope to Africans who have given up the creative ideas and business skills to power ideas of craftsmanship into a successful future.\n\nIn return, the AEMA awards successful African Entrepreneurs and non-profit organisations for their contribution to the development of communities through humanitarian and empowerment initiatives.\n\nStakeholders at the event commended the initiative of the AEMA, noting that the tour of universities would attract and encourage young entrepreneurs to focus on education, agriculture, technology and health to meet the needs of Nigeria\u2019s teeming population and those in the grassroots.\n\nOne of the guests, Mr Omoyele Sowore, a human rights activist and a pro-democracy campaigner, while applauding the AEMA\u2019s initiative, urged well-meaning Nigerians and government at all levels to support such programmes.\n\nSowore said it was necessary for the country to engage young entrepreneurs for high level production to grow the economy.\n\nHe, therefore, charged youths to engage and focus on AEMA\u2019s programmes to transform the country and make it conducive for businesses to thrive.",

The officials were unable to open the second box at the time of filing the report.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billions In Cash Meant For Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram In Abuja Home Of Ex-Chief Of Army Staff, Buratai | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/jjB9VYjkJB pic.twitter.com/U3lTpDMZyq \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 23, 2022\n\n\u201cThey did not submit the money to the CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) but kept it in the facility, trying to move the money. Two boxes were found but they (the ICPC) can\u2019t open the second one still,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nOn Sunday, SaharaReporters learnt $170,0000 (N103,700,000 at the parallel market rate of N610 to $1), \u00a385,000 (N64,600,000 at the parallel market rate of N760 to 1\u00a3) and \u20ac54,000 (N34,020,000 at the parallel market rate of N630 to 1\u20ac) in cash were found in the second box.\n\n\n\nThis amounts to N202,320,000.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported that the ICPC appeared to be doing the bidding of the former Army chief, Buratai, whose house was being used by a proxy, as the agency gave inconsistent figures of the amounts it found in the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items from the building.\n\nSee Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that while the ICPC granted bail to the military contractor fronting for Buratai, claiming that N30 million was found in the apartment, the agency later said in an official release that N175 million was recovered.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, had disclosed on Friday how the apartment was raided but did not give the details of Buratai\u2019s links to the recovery.\n\nBuratai, despite denials by his lawyer and other faceless individuals, already admitted to a newspaper that the property was his and no search warrant was obtained before it was raided.\n\nOne of the sources further revealed that the ICPC figures of recovery had discrepancies all in a bid to cover up for Buratai who is at the heart of the massive corruption unfolding.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Covered Up For Ex-Army Chief, Buratai, Failed To Submit Funds To Central Bank, To Secretly Move Cash From Facility\n\nOne of the sources had said, \u201cBuratai spoke to People\u2019s Gazette saying ICPC had no search warrant contrary to denials by his lawyer that the property was not his.\n\n\u201cICPC granted administrative bail to Buratai\u2019s front claiming that they only found N30 million. They then issued a statement claiming they found N175 million.\"\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time Buratai would be involved in such a massive scandal. Buratai\u2019s first issue was with a businessman who fronted for him in Kano but took away his loot. Buratai got military intelligence to arrest the guy but covered up the issue when the man threatened to spill.\n\n\"They advised Buratai to let him go or find an amicable way of settling the matter. Those involved properties are in Kano and Abuja,\u201d another top source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters on Friday reported that the ICPC confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for Buratai.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00 pm and 12:00 am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billions In Cash Meant For Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram In Abuja Home Of Ex-Chief Of Army Staff, Buratai\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property https://t.co/Kc5qFjmoEI pic.twitter.com/aAOVXKEsha \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 24, 2016\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nSee Also Exclusive Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters' investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

Two boxes were found but they (the ICPC) can\u2019t open the second one still,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nOn Sunday, SaharaReporters learnt $170,0000 (N103,700,000 at the parallel market rate of N610 to $1), \u00a385,000 (N64,600,000 at the parallel market rate of N760 to 1\u00a3) and \u20ac54,000 (N34,020,000 at the parallel market rate of N630 to 1\u20ac) in cash were found in the second box.\n\n\n\nThis amounts to N202,320,000.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier reported that the ICPC appeared to be doing the bidding of the former Army chief, Buratai, whose house was being used by a proxy, as the agency gave inconsistent figures of the amounts it found in the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items from the building.\n\nSee Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that while the ICPC granted bail to the military contractor fronting for Buratai, claiming that N30 million was found in the apartment, the agency later said in an official release that N175 million was recovered.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, had disclosed on Friday how the apartment was raided but did not give the details of Buratai\u2019s links to the recovery.\n\nBuratai, despite denials by his lawyer and other faceless individuals, already admitted to a newspaper that the property was his and no search warrant was obtained before it was raided.\n\nOne of the sources further revealed that the ICPC figures of recovery had discrepancies all in a bid to cover up for Buratai who is at the heart of the massive corruption unfolding.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Covered Up For Ex-Army Chief, Buratai, Failed To Submit Funds To Central Bank, To Secretly Move Cash From Facility\n\nOne of the sources had said, \u201cBuratai spoke to People\u2019s Gazette saying ICPC had no search warrant contrary to denials by his lawyer that the property was not his.\n\n\u201cICPC granted administrative bail to Buratai\u2019s front claiming that they only found N30 million. They then issued a statement claiming they found N175 million.\"\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time Buratai would be involved in such a massive scandal. Buratai\u2019s first issue was with a businessman who fronted for him in Kano but took away his loot. Buratai got military intelligence to arrest the guy but covered up the issue when the man threatened to spill.\n\n\"They advised Buratai to let him go or find an amicable way of settling the matter. Those involved properties are in Kano and Abuja,\u201d another top source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters on Friday reported that the ICPC confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for Buratai.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00 pm and 12:00 am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billions In Cash Meant For Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram In Abuja Home Of Ex-Chief Of Army Staff, Buratai\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property https://t.co/Kc5qFjmoEI pic.twitter.com/aAOVXKEsha \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 24, 2016\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nSee Also Exclusive Revealed: Buhari's Chief Of Army Staff, General Buratai, Wives Own Dubai Property\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters' investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

He recounted how the teacher refused to appear in court on two occasions in the past without any justification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nButtressing his point, the prosecution counsel also narrated how a bench warrant had to be issued against the teacher and executed by police operatives before he could be apprehended and brought to court.\n\nIjagbemi further claimed that while the defendant was on administrative bail, he allegedly committed a similar offence for which he is being arraigned.\n\nIn his ruling, Akeem Fashola, the judge, ordered that the teacher should be remanded in the prison till July 12 when his bail application would be considered.\n\nThe judge said the exhibits brought before the court by Babaji Sunday, the FCT police commissioner, and other arguments against the bail application need to be properly evaluated before arriving at a conclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "A Nigerian woman has claimed that King Sunny Ade, the juju music singer, is her biological father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman, named Elizabeth Temitope Ayeni, detailed a years-long paternity dispute in an interview with Punch.\n\nShe said her aged mother revealed this in 2019 after misleading her about her biological father for years.\n\nAyeni said she became inquisitive after a prophet told her there is a secret her mother was hiding from her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman said her mother told her Sunny Ade is her father after decades of withholding this information.\n\nAyeni recounted how unsuccessful trials to get through to the music star led her to National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) for help.\n\nShe said all effort to get Sunny Ade is still futile even after the NHRC sent him letters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe further said the intent was to establish a relationship with him rather than to get financial benefits.\n\nSunny Ade is believed to have married up to seven wives.\n\nBelow, Ayeni narrates her attempt to connect with the singer:\n\n\u201cIn 2019, a pastor told me to ask my mother to reveal a secret to me. First, I didn\u2019t take it seriously until my husband told me to. So I called my mother and she confessed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy mother said the man I had always known as my father, isn\u2019t my biological father. She said my biological father is Niyi and he is from Ondo state. When I asked who Niyi is, she said Sunny Ade the singer.\n\n\u201cMy mother said it all began when she was still living with her father. Then, her father wanted to marry her off to an aged man but she refused because she had met Sunny Ade earlier and was two months pregnant for him.\n\n\u201cShe said she eventually got married to the aged man since she couldn\u2019t get in touch with Sunny Ade anymore. After getting married, my mother said she went in search of Sunny Ade but couldn\u2019t find him.\n\n\u201cShe went back to her parent\u2019s place after the search and delivered me there. So, when I was two-year-old my mother left me with my grandma and remarried. Since the confession, I have been searching for Sunny Ade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI also went to a festival where he performed but couldn\u2019t get through to him. Every effort to meet with him has been fruitless so I went to NHRC for help.\n\n\u201cNHRC has also taken two letters and photographs to him but to no avail. All I want is to know my background not because Sunny Ade is wealthy.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kune, the controversial Kenyan foodtech startup, has shut down",
          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support.

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How renewable energy can solve Nigeria\u2019s energy crisis",
          "text": "Fuel queues recently resurfaced in many filling stations across the country following the shutdown of operations by some independent petroleum marketers who argue that they are no longer making reasonable profit by selling petrol at the government-stipulated price of N165 per litre.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time as Nigerian businesses and households have been grappling with the skyrocketing price of diesel since the beginning of the year. In January 2022, the price of diesel hovered around N350 per litre. Today, it goes for as high as N850 per litre in some parts of the country.\n\nThese rising energy prices have had a far-reaching economic impact. Many businesses and households that depend on diesel-powered and petrol-powered generators, amidst the continuing unreliability of power from the national grid, have seen their operating and living expenses go up. To cushion the effects of these soaring energy prices, various businesses have resorted to passing down the cost to their customers, leading to a rise in the prices of their services and commodities in the market and further chipping away at the income levels and purchasing power of the consumers.\n\nAccording to a report by the Paris-based International Energy Association (IEA), nearly half of all Africans without electricity live in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda. The Energy Progress Report 2022, published by the IEA alongside the United Nations Statistics Division, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), estimates that about 92 million Nigerians lack access to electricity from the national grid.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all rosy for those fortunate enough to have access to the national grid either, especially when you consider the fact that the national grid has collapsed at least five times this year already, plunging the entire country into near-total darkness.\n\nRead also: How sesame tumbled as Nigeria\u2019s top non-oil export product\n\nIt is clear that we have not been able to get it right in the energy generation and supply department as a country, despite possessing abundant crude oil reserves. It therefore makes sense for one to begin to wonder if renewable energy, especially off-grid renewable energy, could be the remedy for our thus-far seemingly intractable energy malaise.\n\nLike crude oil, Nigeria has abundant renewable energy potentials. Renewable energy, by definition, is energy that is derived from resources that can be replenished naturally on a human timescale. Five major sources of renewable energy exist: solar, hydro, wind, biomass and geothermal.\n\nMost parts of the country receive generous amounts of sunlight all year round, except, perhaps, for a few cloudy hours in a day during the rainy season. Large rivers crisscross the country, while windswept hills and coastlines punctuate its landscape. There\u2019s also plentiful vegetation suitable for biofuel. And considerable progress has been made in identifying and exploring potential geothermal sites in the country.\n\nDue to the relative advancement in indigenous expertise in solar photovoltaic technology, solar energy is the most widely available source of renewable energy in the Nigerian market. The assumed potential for solar power generation in Nigeria is 427,000 MW. In a country with an energy supply gap of at least 180,000 MW, according to the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, this is huge and potentially game-changing.\n\nTransitioning to solar energy systems can represent an effective cost-saving strategy for businesses and households. While the initial cost of purchasing a solar energy system may be high compared to diesel-powered and fuel-powered generators, many solar energy companies have flexible payment plans in place to cushion the impact of the initial outlay on their customers. Besides, solar energy systems are more durable and easier to maintain in the long run and they do not require constant fueling as sunlight is a free gift of nature.\n\nIssues around the high cost of solar energy systems (which has made them uncompetitive compared to fossil fuel generators), long wait for investment returns and inadequate information about renewable energy products have hindered the full take-off of the renewable energy industry in Nigeria. The government and other stakeholders can step in to facilitate the diffusion of renewable energy in the country.\n\nCommercial banks and other fund providers, for instance, can address the financing gap by developing innovative supply-side and demand-side financial products for operators and consumers in the renewable energy industry.\n\nOn the supply side, low-cost funding should be made available to manufacturers and service providers to catalyze local production. On the demand side, low-cost financing should be made available to businesses and households that desire to purchase renewable energy solutions.\n\nGovernment incentives, partnerships, patronage, demand aggregation, advocacy and capacity development are some of the other strategies that can be employed to help solar energy companies to enjoy the economies of scale, bring down the cost of their products and become more competitive. While the focus in Nigeria seems to be on solar, we must not lose sight of other renewable energy solutions like wind farms, off-grid hydroelectric power and biofuels.\n\nAside from its positive impact on the environment, the bottom lines of businesses and the disposable incomes of households, transitioning to renewable energy can also have a positive macroeconomic monetary impact. Between 30% and 40% of the country\u2019s scarce FX is spent on the importation of petroleum products like gasoline (petrol) and diesel annually, according to the Central Bank of Nigeria. Adopting renewable energy solutions can curb the demand for and importation of these petroleum products and go a long way in stabilizing the country\u2019s exchange rate.\n\nChinedu George Nnawetanma is a strategy and economic development professional.

          "title": "How to facilitate leadership succession in your organisation",
          "text": "When experienced workers leave an organisation, they take more than leadership skills or one pair of hands to do the work. Experienced workers also possess unique knowledge about the way past decisions have been made and why. That knowledge is vital for future competitive advantage.\n\nIt is rarely possible to reach the next generation without knowing what came before it. Besides, experienced workers have built a social network of people who help them accomplish their goals. But a successor will not know those people and may require years to establish a track record with critical social contacts.\n\nSo, how is your organisation handling succession planning and management?\n\nSuccession planning and management should not be confused with replacement planning, though they are compatible and often overlap. The apparent need for replacement is frequently a driving force behind efforts that eventually turn into succession planning and management programmes.\n\nSuccession planning should not stand alone. It should be paired with succession management. Succession management focuses on continuing daily efforts to build talent and may include the manager\u2019s role in coaching, giving feedback, and helping individuals realise their potential.\n\nA combination of succession planning and management programme is an organisation\u2019s deliberate and systematic effort to ensure leadership continuity in key positions, retain and develop intellectual and knowledge capital for the future, and encourage individual advancement. It is a proactive approach and should not be confused with replacement planning, which is risk management and is more limited in scope and reactive.\n\nSuccession planning and management are a strategy for identifying and developing future leaders for an organisation, not just at the top but also for significant roles at all levels. It helps organisations prepare for all contingencies by preparing high-potential workers for advancement.\n\nAs managers, our function includes identifying crucial job skills, knowledge, social relationships, and organisational practices and passing them on to prepare the future employees, thereby ensuring the seamless movement of skills and high-performing personnel within the organisation.\n\nEffective job design, varied internal development opportunities, and a smart organisational structure are essential to promote corporate objectives while creating an environment that fosters employee engagement and retention. The convergence of the organisation\u2019s needs and the employees\u2019 interests can occur in succession management because of its broad scope and open process.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that successful succession planning and management programs require the contributions and effort of various critical individuals across the organisation.\n\nSenior executives, management team, human resources, training and development, and managers and supervisors have ongoing roles in identifying and developing talent and ensuring that succession activities are seamlessly embedded into the organisation.\n\nStarting and executing a succession planning programme is not different from any other significant corporate initiative. It requires a focus on change management, communication, and cultural alignment that must be actively managed.\n\nHere are a few considerations for a successful succession management programme:\n\nAs we think beyond hiring or promoting today, our interest should be in the skills and experience we will need to gain future competitive advantage. Hence, we must discern the industry\u2019s direction and the potential progress it will make in the next five to twenty years. What areas of the business will grow?\n\nWhat areas will be scaled back? Is it likely that the organisation will expand and bring new talents into the organisation? How will technology impact the way we work? What types of national and international content needs and skills will emerge? We must identify the core competencies required for a broad range of critical positions, including those that may not exist today.\n\nWe must also evaluate the organisation\u2019s current capabilities and develop or acquire the learning and training opportunities required to fill the gaps. We must also pay attention to the functions and business units that will need an infusion of new talents in the future and start bringing in new employees with the proper skill sets in these required areas.\n\nLike any corporate initiative, buy-in and involvement from the C-suite are imperative. The managers must understand the value of succession planning, coaching, and developing talent beyond their immediate reports.\n\nThe organisation must continually assess key talents and determine if skilled workers have the competencies and experience required to move beyond their current positions.\n\nIt\u2019s a common fallacy that an individual doing an excellent job in their current position is ready for promotion. The succession planning team needs to determine the leadership and management requirements for each critical role and then decide if there are high-performing employees who meet those detailed criteria.\n\nIf the identified candidates do not yet have the full range of required skills, the succession planning team must determine the training or work experience to fill the gaps.\n\nSome employees might be encouraged to return to school for further education; others might benefit from leading a cross-functional project team or taking a specialised training class.\n\nStill, others might require a short-term assignment in other business units. We must remember that every employee is different; hence, every development path must be different.\n\nAlso, communication with high performers is critical to ensure that our employees understand what the organisation is working to accomplish through these recommendations. They must see assignments and training as part of a tailored plan to improve their value, not random suggestions.\n\nRead also: Trustworthy leadership\n\nWe must ensure that our programs are integrated into other talent management processes and practices, including job titling, training, compensation, learning and development, and rewards and recognition.\n\nThis often requires employees to accept lateral or diagonal career moves to round out their experience. They ensure that such actions do not diminish employees\u2019 job titles and compensation opportunities are critical to employee acceptance and job satisfaction.\n\nIt is crucial to monitor and evaluate the performance of succession planning efforts and adjust as necessary. Some key metrics to be used include measuring the reduction in the cost of turnover, the percentage of critical vacancies filled by internal candidates, and the number of successful promotions.\n\nAnother option might be to use employee surveys to identify high performers\u2019 engagement levels and gauge their feelings about their career development efforts.",
          "summary": "So, how is your organisation handling succession planning and management?\nSuccession planning and management should not be confused with replacement planning, though they are compatible and often overlap.\nThe apparent need for replacement is frequently a driving force behind efforts that eventually turn into succession planning and management programmes.\nThe managers must understand the value of succession planning, coaching, and developing talent beyond their immediate reports.\nIt is crucial to monitor and evaluate the performance of succession planning efforts and adjust as necessary.",

          "text": "I was not made for Nigerian roads. I thrive better in other climes. Neither does Dr Bob Arnot, my friend who was in charge of \u201cJustice for all\u201d for Nigeria many years ago. Being married to a Nigerian, Bob contributed three pieces to this column at the start of it. All of it was about how driving in Nigeria is a suicidal business.\n\nIn fact, in one of Bob\u2019s pieces, he mentioned that every time he left home in Maitama in Abuja to his office also in Maitama he felt he might die in an accident, even though the distance is only 10 minutes. In fact, I was in stitches when I re-read all his pieces recently.\n\nHow, we are often reading and driving, eating and driving, fully distracted by sisi on the highway or stopping mid-highway to buy food or ease ourselves without a care for the driver behind us. Bob was pretty bullish about our honking manners. For the umpteenth time, I wish to relate our habit of honking and how full-grown men and women, no matter their level, honk endlessly for no reason.\n\nWe used to think only taxi drivers do that but we now know that most people do the unimaginable when they are on Nigerian roads. By the way, these are things they dare not do outside Nigeria\n\nWe used to think only taxi drivers do that but we now know that most people do the unimaginable when they are on Nigerian roads. By the way, these are things they dare not do outside Nigeria. Honk endlessly? Impossible! Nigerians behave themselves outside Nigeria. They know the laws there and keep it. Here. Ah! The enforcement leaves a lot to be desired. They make it easy to break the law. The traffic warden has a stick, and well, other enforcers are bendable.\n\nBut it is our impatience that takes the cake. My people cannot wait for a pedestrian to cross. Then they jump traffic lights and overtake when they should not, putting everyone also at risk. Have you ever tried to deal with a driver behind you that seems to want to obliterate you by his sheer speed.\n\nWhen my son was younger, his classmates and himself had a mantra \u2018No time.\u2019 When I say eat before your football match. He says, No time. So, we are by nature people in a hurry to nowhere. Often, when the crash happens as a result of No time, we now remember God and how the devil deceived us.\n\nWe can be more reflective even in our driving. More thoughtful. More considerate. As you put your leg on that accelerator be kind to the next driver. Nigerians. Drive more carefully. Be more polite on the wheels. It is possible!\n\nAccident victims across the country are languishing in hospitals with broken limbs, and many people have passed on because someone did not pay attention. Driving while texting is still a norm in Nigeria and I still see parents keep unstamped babies in front seats.\n\nIt is sad when we drive like speed athletes on our highways forgetting that there are other road users and the car is a machine, it can fail and you can be tired, careless and lose control. Let us be more genteel, more caring, more humane on the highway. From a crash, you or someone else can die. Trust me. The meeting you were hurrying to will go on without you. Let us pause\u2026 Drive more carefully.",

          "title": "The hard reality of this season, By Elliot Uko",
          "text": "The electioneering fever is raging, and excitement, hope and dreams rule our hearts. Political parties are in season. Issues that have shaped discourse for years, are aggregating thoughts, decisions and narratives. Flicker of hope arises in the hearts of the younger generation, that the country could be salvaged. Old war horses remain pessimistic about the future of the land. Politicos dutifully pretend they hold the answers. Reality hides in-between.\n\nFinally the PVC revolution advocated for by certain activists I know, gladly becomes a reality. But a lot remains to be done. More machines, more centres and security for prospective voters, are needed. It doesn\u2019t really matter that the PVC revolution took off late. It doesn\u2019t matter that it was only taken seriously, just recently. The important thing is that our people have woken up and the electoral process and our fledging democracy is gonna be deepened.\n\nThe election eight months away, promises to be like no other before it. Surprises are possible. Participation by the beleaguered and hapless electorate will be huge. Welcome development.\n\nBut does this mean that votes will truly count this time around? Will owners of Naija allow voters to decide? Have those bent on disenfranchising certain ethnic groups resident in their region repented? Are we eventually going to have a peaceful, credible poll?\n\nWill the emergence of a new President next year vitiate the truth that our structural deficiencies which gave birth to most of our challenges as a country, be altruistically, consensually and sincerely addressed.\n\nIs it possible to grow and make Nigeria great under this current suffocating unitary structure? Will the election of your friend, neighbour, kinsman or preffered choice, change the hard truth and unflattering fact that no individual, no matter how gifted, can possibly transform Nigeria positively under this centralised 1999 constitution?\n\nCan our excitement over the election of our man, associate, party\u2019s candidate, tribesmen, hero, miraculously remove the unattractive reality, that only a return to true federalism and devolution of powers, can actually heal Nigeria?\n\nWill the disappointing reality that some people just do not want to hear about the inevitable restructuring of the country, suddenly make 2023 elections the be-all and end-all solution to the numerous ailments plaguing Nigeria?\n\nIs it really true that once your, brother, man or preferred candidate is elected, legislator, Governor, Vice President or President, that all our problems vanishes and the suffocating unitary structure hindering our progress will no longer matter? Questions.\n\nThe political actors are still working on their manifesto, but they all assure us electing them will transform our country. But we heard same stories in 2007, 2011, and 2015. They are singing the same song yet again. Funny.\n\nBola Tinubu and his team believe he will win. They are hoping on oiling, recalibrating amd strengthening the South West/North alliance that brought Buhari to power seven years ago. A coalition built more on anger over Jonathan\u2019s close relationship with the region they militarily crushed in 1970, and a determination to remove and isolate the recalcitrant region, than on truly rejuvenating and redeeming the land.\n\nHe and his Northern political allies, relishing their recent ability in humbling the Presidency during the party primaries are riding stubbornly on a North/South West coalition that hopes to exchange baton between themselves moving forward, establishing themselves as the new power base. Tinubu didn\u2019t even bother to campaign in the South East, same thing Buhari did eight years ago. \u201cWe can run Nigeria without them, they surrounded Jonathan prancing about like drunken peacocks, we\u2019ll teach them a lesson \u201d\n\nThe alliance strategically reaches out to embrace just the middle belt, probably only willing to poach votes from the South East and South South, while wholly banking on the North West, North East and South West as their power base.\n\nAtiku Abubakar on the hand, hopes on the nation wide support base of his party which is the oldest and largest, with structures in all 774 local government councils. He also isn\u2019t seriously courting the South East, but strategically picked an Igbo from South South. He is simply counting on appropriating the cultural and traditional fanatical Northern sentiment and emotions of preference for one of their own, since the only threat to that, Mohammadu Buhari, will not be on the ballot for the first time in 20 years. He certainly will reach discreet deals with traditional rulers, Islamic clergy and influential opinion leaders of the entire North to work out a deal where Northerners are encouraged to vote any other party of their choice at the legislative and Governorship elections, but choosing him at the Presidential poll, in order to retain power in their region. He seems confident of victory.\n\nPeter Obi pushed by other Nigerians as the preffered choice of his abandoned and disregarded South East brethren, isn\u2019t actually the Igbo candidate. Rather he represents the aggregated anger of the younger generation of Nigerians, frustrated with the country and the hopelessness in the land.\n\nHe smartly appropriated the anger over the inanity that has become standard character of our land, promising a breath of fresh air. Flaunting a credible pedigree and burning desire to enact change, he cleverly presented himself as a desirable alternative to the asinity and absurdities in the land.\n\nHaving successfully sold himself to the larger aggrieved population of the land, especially the younger generation, his people had no choice, but adopt him as the hope of the people. His relatively small platform, isn\u2019t a plus, but the anger and frustration in the land, and the ongoing PVC revolution, may help him swing surprises.\n\nAll the other candidates can only make impact if they build alliance with others. That\u2019s all about the almighty 2023 elections and the prominent actors.\n\nBut this hard reality of the season, does not in anyway remove the truth about the stark reality of our sad situation: Which is that the poverty, unemployment, hunger, animosity, sectarianism, sleaze, insecurity, and agitation ravaging the land, is derived from the fear, lack of interest and loss of faith by sections of the country.\n\nIssues inspired by broken and weak institutions, nepotism, mediocrity, impunity and prebendalism, all as a result of centralised structure that concentrates all power at the centre denying the federating units breathing space and empowerment to thrive, resulting to salaries, pensions and other emoluments owed marooned population, deepening the suffering and despair in the land.\n\nContinuing to deceive ourselves, won\u2019t resolve the issue. The need to reconstruct our polity is imperative and urgent.\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko is the founder of Igbo Youth Movement and secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly.",

Why are they raising issues now?\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that when he was in exile, his house at Balarabe Musa Crescent in Surulere was burnt by the military and he couldn\u2019t pick out a pin from the razed building.\n\n\u201cThis was what happened that time and if in 2022, he (Tinubu) now drew blank on that session, what offence has he committed?\u201d he wondered.",

We only go to our state capital, Ibadan to do official assignments, but domestically, we in Oyo North do most of our business activities in Ilorin and for almost a week now, Ohan bridge has been unpassable,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the state of disrepair of the Ohan and Moro bridges was holding the commerce of the areas by the jugular, adding that: \u201cOur rural markets are no longer functioning because customers are not having access to them due to the bad road,\u201d lamenting that as food baskets, the urban areas get their food from the grassroots.\n\nLEADERSHIP recalls that the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the State, had recently visited the site of Ohan bridge and drew the attention of both the state and the Federal Ministry of Works to its deplorable condition.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday said he made a mistake picking his number two when he wanted to become the country\u2019s democratically elected president in 1999, saying God saved him because it was a \u2018genuine mistake\u2019.\n\nObasanjo who stated this while fielding questions posed to him by students from selected secondary schools that participated in the final of the National Exhibition and Awards, organized by Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship (SAGE) also took a cursory look at the current political system in the country and declared that the much touted \u201cNot Too Young To Run\u201d campaign cannot work in favour of the Nigerian youths.\n\nAtiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party for the 2023 election served as Obasanjo\u2019s Vice President between 1999 and 2007.\n\nBoth Obasanjo and Atiku have had a turbulent relationship over the years with the former president vowing to never support the candidacy of his former vice, once saying God wouldn\u2019t forgive him if he did so.\n\nHe however did support Atiku in the 2019 election. It is that support and the glowing tribute that the former president paid to his former deputy that the Atiku campaign is latching onto in defense of the recent comment.\n\nAtiku said his former boss has no regrets about working with him, adding that he had recommended him to become president of Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP candidate said his former boss had paid glowing tribute on how he, as vice president served meritoriously and that he has the experience and exposure to take over from president Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAtiku who reacted to the comments by Obasanjo through his media aide, Paul Ibe, sent LEADERSHIP Sunday a video clip of Obasanjo paying tribute to him.\n\nIbe did not however mention the many occasions where Obasanjo used harsh words, particularly in his autobiography criticizing Atiku and his suitability to lead Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo, in the said video culled from Channels TV, decked in a white agbada with grey embroidery, a traditional cap with same blend of colours, referred to Atiku as having the experience, exposure and as having learnt lessons to occupy the presidential office.\n\nThe event was when Atiku met with the Lagos Island Club in the build up to 2019 presidential election.\n\nObasanjo, in the video said, \u201cVice president Atiku, now candidate Atiku and soon to become President Atiku. As a leader you must understand the fundamentals of the problems you have to solve and be courageous, visionary and be able to reach out sufficiently to build a credible team of experts, knowledgeable men and women, concerned and interested citizens, and non citizens to work hard and tirelessly for solutions that will benefit all Nigerians and indeed all Africans and all humanity.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, my dear senior brother, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, you have a man who has what it takes in experience, in exposure in lessons that he has learnt and he has learnt his lessons.\n\n\u201cI tried to teach him a few of them. You have a man who has what it takes at this time for us to have a change and we need a change for the better,\u201d the former president said.\n\nIbe said, \u201cWhat he said in the video was and is still valid. What he said in the video is our response. It does not sound like a regret. He was paying eulogies to his then Vice President for a meritorious service to him and the nation, and urging that he be elevated to higher responsibilities on account of his sterling service.\u201d\n\nIn his latest commentary, the former president, spoke on Saturday on the opportunities for the youths to take over the mantle of leadership in the country at the event held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, Ogun State capital.\n\nHe said youths can never come into power should the current trend in the political architecture of Nigeria continue.\n\nHe said with the,\u2019\u2019 Not Too Young to Run campaign and you can see that those that are contesting now are between 70 and 80 years old, how can the youth run.\n\n\u201cAnother thing inhibiting youths from running is the amount of money involved in going into politics. I hope that things should not continue like this.\n\n\u201cI was 39 years old when I became the Military Head of State. Twenty years later, I came back as civilian president, but those there now do not want to allow the youth. If things continue like this, I do not know how you can come in.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in retrospect on his journey of life during the question and answer interactive session with the students, Obasanjo disclosed that he made many mistakes, which he could describe as genuine mistakes in his life, but God made him to overcome them.\n\n\u201cOne of the mistakes I made was picking my Number Two when I wanted to become the president. But because it was a genuine mistake God saved me.\n\n\u201cThe second one was when Abacha wanted to arrest me. When Abacha wanted to arrest me, I was told by the American ambassador that they will arrest me and that America has asked that I should be given asylum. I said no. It could have been a mistake because I could have lost my life.\n\n\u201cI will say there are many things that could have been a mistake but God saved me from them all\u201d.\n\nWhile tutoring the students to imbibe the spirit of religious tolerance, Obasanjo also advised them not to see their own religion as being superior to that of another person.\n\n\u201cI have no right to say what another man believes in is inferior to mine. If God had wanted all of us to be of the same religion, he would have made it so and since He did not make it so, no person should attempt to make it so.\n\n\u201cYoung people should learn at a very early age that if there are five religions in the world, that is how God wants it to be. If there are ten, that is how God wants it. All religions originate from the same source.\n\n\u201cIf you are a Muslim and you did not live the way the God wants you to live, you cannot enter Aljannah. If you are a Christian and you did not live the way God wants you to live, the same thing, you will not enter paradise.\n\n\u201cIf this is the basis of religion, doing the right thing for the benefit of mankind, you don\u2019t have to condemn any person because of what he believes.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any religion is superior to mine and I do not believe that mine is superior to another person\u2019s beliefs. I will not allow any person to cast aspersions on my religion and will not do the same for another person. Practice your religion the way God wants you to do it and don\u2019t condemn another person\u201d.\n\nWelcoming participants at the event, the Chairman of SAGE Nigeria, Agwu Amogu, said the programme was to celebrate the creative energies and commitments of teen entrepreneurs who see the challenges in the communities as their responsibilities.\n\nHe explained that \u201cSAGE\u201d is an acronym for Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship. It is an international program initiated at the California State University Chico USA in 2002 and currently operational in over 32 countries across all the continents of the world.\n\n\u201cIt offers secondary school aged young people a hands-on learning process on how to create wealth, help others and their communities.\u201d\n\nAmigu said since the introduction of the program in Nigeria in 2006, it had shown that it is a potent strategy and model for educational reform, youth re-orientation, job creation and poverty alleviation and multi-cultural integration\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria urgently needs a new paradigm for education.\n\n\u201cThe new paradigm must provide students with a chance to learn while solving community problems and immediately applying what they have learnt in the classroom by actually doing something great.\n\n\u201cWe now live in a world where any country can compete effectively with others based on the creative imagination of its human capital.\n\nThere is no better place to stoke the fire of imagination than in the young people. And that is where SAGE comes in.\n\n\u201cSAGE is about CREATING value. Students are encouraged to create something of value in their communities by applying what they learn in the classroom and testing it in the ultimate laboratory\u2026. the free market,\u201d he said.\n\nAmogu, who commended the feat of Nigerian students since the commencement of the programme in the country, the country\u2019s representatives , had been fantastic in the competition.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe firmly believe that Nigeria can be a world leader in providing potent human capital to the rest of the world; setting a benchmark for other countries to follow.\n\n\u201cHaving won the SAGE World cup 8 times in the last 12 years, I have no doubt in my mind that Nigerian young people are one of the most energetic and enterprising in the world and they can quicken our rise to a global superpower status.\u201d\n\nThe SAGE chairman said winners of this year\u2019s competition would represent Nigeria in the SAGE World Competition held in the Netherlands in August, 2022.",

          "text": "In what appeared to be a dramatic political volte-face, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said yesterday that Nigerians who are currently registering in the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will now get their permanent voters card (PVCs) in October 2022 instead of January.\n\nThe nation\u2019s electoral body had earlier said new PVC registrants would get their card in January 2023, a month before the general elections.\n\nThe January date announced by the commission for the collection of PVCs had generated negative reactions, with some Nigerians alleging that it was a ploy to disenfranchise them in the 2023 general election which is billed to commence in February 2022.\n\nBut speaking during a Youth Vote Must Count 2.0 concert organized in Abuja by INEC, Yiaga Africa and the European Union, INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday assured new registrants that they would get their PVCs in October this year.\n\n\u201cNow, when will your PVCs be ready for collection? I want to assure you that the PVC will be ready for Collection latest in October this year. So all of you will have your PVCs,\u201d he said.\n\nYakubu said INEC registered over 14,000 Nigerians during the mega concert in Abuja.\n\nThe INEC chairman was however silent on the deadline for voter registration exercise, but assured that the registration will continue.\n\n\u201cSo, we will not stop registration until we are satisfied that those who wish to register are given the opportunity to do so,\u201d he stated.\n\nRecalling that INEC had deployed more machines to the states two weeks ago, Yakubu said, \u201cIn this place, this is the Old Parade Ground. In the last five days, Monday to yesterday Friday, we were still registering today, but in the last five days, we have registered over 14,000 Nigerians in this place.\n\n\u201cHere in this place, we have 50 voter registration machines. Two weeks ago, we deployed more machines to the states. More machines left yesterday and more machines are leaving today all over the country. By Monday there will be more machines to register more Nigerians.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to use their PVCs primarily for election purposes and not for bank account opening.\n\nHis words: \u201cNow, when will your PVCs be ready for collection, I want to assure you that the PVC will be ready for Collection Latest October this year. So, all of you will have your PVCs.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for making the PVC the most popular ID card in Nigeria today, not being the PVC. But, what do you do with your PVCs, don\u2019t use the PVC for all other things. The PVC is for election not opening of bank accounts.\n\n\u201cPlease use your PVCs for the election. So I want to ask you. I will also give you my own promise; for those of you who registered on what we call the INEC reserve viewing portal, you were seeing the results from the polling units on Election Day in Ekiti state. Ekiti was good, Osun is going to be better and 2023 will be the best. Your votes will count.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her speech, the head of the European Union delegation to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi, charged Nigerian youths to take hold of their future.\n\nReaffirming EU\u2019s partnership with the Nigerian Youths, she urged them to remain strong against opposition.\n\nShe said, \u201cDo your work to remain the master of your future; they do not know how to do it. Go out, vote! Vote for your leaders, challenge them, hold them accountable and stand for your values and your opposition.\n\n\u201cThis is the way to build democracy. This is the way you can get better governance, a better future, and a better Nigeria. We, the European Union, stand by you, we want to work together with you to make Nigerian democracy stronger. Now this is the result of a great partnership.\u201d",

We want to see them. I remember in 1999 when we had the election, when they pulled his paper that he filled with INEC, they now asked him to produce all the papers.\n\n\u201cHe said he went to Government College, Ibadan and Children\u2019s Home School in Ibadan, we went there we checked, what year? Nothing. He then quickly came out to say it was Afikuyomi that filled it because if you went to a particular school, you must have friends because you won\u2019t be the only one in that College.\u201d",

          "text": "Lincoln University, United Kingdom has banned Ike Ekweremadu from his duties as a visiting professor pending the conclusion of the organ harvesting allegation leveled against him.\n\nAccording to a report by Daily Mail UK, the ban was imposed by the institution following the arrest and subsequent arraignment of Ekweremadu and Beatrice, his wife, at the Uxbridge Magistrate Court in London for alleged plans to harvest the kidney of Ukpo Nwamini David, a minor, on June 23.\n\nDavid was said to have been trafficked using a fake passport.\n\nEkweremadu and his wife are accused of facilitating David\u2019s entry into the UK to transplant his kidney into their daughter who is suffering from kidney failure. The former Deputy Senate President of Nigeria was recently appointed a visiting professor of Corporate and International Linkages by the British school.\n\n\u201cVisiting professors are often, as is in this case, non-resident at the university, unpaid and advisory,\u201d a Lincoln University spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the nature of these allegations, but as this is an active police investigation, we cannot comment further at this stage.\n\n\u201cWhilst this matter is subject to investigation, this person will not be undertaking any duties as visiting professor at Lincoln.\u201d\n\nDavid claimed he did not know he was in the United Kingdom to donate a kidney until he went for a hospital appointment with the Ekweremadus. A doctor at the Royal Free Hospital in Camden, London, was concerned that David might not be aware he was a kidney donor. The doctor also doubted that the minor was 21 as his passport claimed.\n\nWhile appearing in court on Thursday, the senator and his wife, who is a medical doctor, however, denied trafficking David to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe victim was 15. In Nigeria, he was approached by both defendants. He was homeless on the streets of Lagos. They deceived him and promised him a better life in the UK. He was given a passport for a 41-year-old. The passport was illegally obtained by these defendants,\u201d Damla Ayas, the prosecutor, told the court during the couple\u2019s first hearing.\n\n\u201cHe was provided with a medical travel visa saying the purpose of the travel was to provide medical treatment for the defendants\u2019 daughter who was undergoing dialysis about several health issues.\n\n\u201cIt was premeditated; it was planned. Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he traveled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u201cHe was taken to several medical appointments, in particular, a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital, and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cThe consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe Ekweremadus was arrested at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey.\n\nDavid is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police.\n\nFresh twist\n\nDavid\u2019s (the young man who was to donate a kidney to Sonia , daughter of Senator Ekweremadu) passport has emerged, indicating that he is 21 years old.\n\nAccording to information on the data page of Nwamini\u2019s international passport, which Ekweremadu provided in an introductory letter in the medical visa application submitted to the British High Commission in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, he was born on October 12, 2000.\n\nThe date of issuance of the passport is indicated as November 4, 2021 while his date of birth is October 12, 2000. This puts the age of the passport holder in question at 21.\n\nBut under British law, being above 18 is not enough to be an organ donor, as the question of consent is another burden the Ekweremadus will have to discharge.\n\nYet, questions would remain with respect to whether the birth date on the passport is indeed his real age.",

It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe INEC spokesperson added that a candidate who was validly nominated at a primary, but whose name was excluded by the party, can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday is not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nExperts at a One-Day Interactive Workshop on Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN, have asserted the obvious fact that an effective service delivery in the sector was dependent on the quality of practitioners and their professional competence.\n\nIn the paper titled \u2018Effective Customer Service Delivery for Tourism and Hospitality Professionals\u2019 presented at the occasion, Alhaji Abdulmalik Hassan, an advocate for quality service, stated that excellent customer service delivered in the appropriate way, is a prerequisite for effective and efficient business management that guarantees customer satisfaction, patronage and retention.\n\nHassan said service delivery in the tourism and hospitality industry deserves much more than it has because, due to lapses in the manner and way personnel and staff of individual tourism and hospitality organizations conduct themselves with customers, they end up losing customer patronage and running down their businesses, noting that we take for granted the way the gateman and receptionist welcome guests, and that once the guest does not receive an amiable reception from the on-set at the entry point, the organization losses the ability to command customer satisfaction let alone retain customer patronage.\n\nIn his submission, the tourism expert advocated for more attention on training and equipping lower cadre staff with the necessary skills to deliver better customer service than the current trends in which most organizations spend huge resources training their top executives.\n\nAnother facilitator at the occasion, Capt. Emmanuel LordsGreat who delivered a paper on \u2018Re-Inventing Customer Experience for Tourism and Hospitality Industry\u2019 posited that businesses have changed from manufacturing dependence to providing timely and quality service, and that due to increase in technology and globalization, there has been a dramatic change in customer behaviour which service providers must understand and come to terms with.\n\nLordsGreat stressed that Customers are increasingly becoming aware of the need to get value for their money and will frown at poor quality service delivery from mediocre organizations. This therefore meant that hospitality and tourism organizations must work on customer satisfaction and retention efforts which were key to keeping them from running away.\n\n\u201d What drive customers away is rude and discourteous behaviour, inept, and incompetence dispositions of staff during service delivery,\u201d he added.\n\nHe alluded that knowing the obvious fact that customers are the most important people to an organization, and also that organizations depend on customers not the other way round and are in fact the lifeblood of an organization, taking measures to serve them to the best of their satisfaction was fundamental and should not be compromised.\n\nAlso the Director General of the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism, Nura Sani Kangiwa, who was the special Guest of Honour at the occasion, represented by Dr. Taiwo Famogbiyele, Director, General Studies, Research and Development, delivered the keynote address in which he affirmed that the success of harnessing the country\u2019s tourism potentials through effective service delivery was highly dependent on the quality of professionals and practitioners in the sector, noting that there was urgent need for adequate sensitization in terms of education and impacting of relevant training and skills to the personnel and drivers of the industry such as the one organized by the FCT Chapter of the Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, ITPN.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address, convener of the workshop and Chairman of the FCT Chapter of ITPN, Dr. Mrs. Ebikaboere Seimodei said a flourishing tourism industry can only be achieved via quality service delivery which the country stands to benefit from its economic values such as generating income, providing job opportunities, ensuring foreign exchange earnings, increase in internally generated revenue via taxation and the attendant multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, and when service delivery was poor, the result will be dwindling fortunes in the industry and low economic value to the national economy.\n\nSeimodei then called on practitioners in the industry to support efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN in capacity development for enhanced service delivery, particularly in this age of increased technological skills and changing visitor/consumer preferences as well as meet the expectations of tourists in conformity with global best practices.\n\nOther guests who gave goodwill messages at the occasion includes Chief Abiodun Odusanwo, National President of ITPN; Mrs. Susan Akporiaye, President of the National Association of Nigerian Travel Agents, NANTA and Barr. Funmi Kazeem, Hotel Owners Forum of Abuja, HOFA; who praised efforts of the FCT Chapter of ITPN by bringing to the front burner the issue of training and re-training of practitioners in the industry for better and quality service delivery by professionals in the sector.\n\nCertificates were later presented to participants at the workshop as testimony of attendance and acquisition of the requisite knowledge and skills in the ethics of customer service delivery as professionals in the travel tourism and hospitality industry.",

          "title": "Russian Missiles Shake Kyiv as World Leaders Gather in Europe",
          "text": "Russian missiles struck the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, a day after a key eastern city fell to pro-Russian forces in a major set-back for Ukraine and as world leaders gathered in Europe to discuss further sanctions against Moscow.\n\nUp to four explosions rang out in central Kyiv in the early hours, in the first such attack on the city in weeks. Two more blasts were heard on the southern outskirts of the city later in the day, a Reuters reporter said.\n\n\u201cThe Russians hit Kyiv again. Missiles damaged an apartment building and a kindergarten,\u201d said Andriy Yermak, head of the president\u2019s administration.\n\nUkraine\u2019s police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said on national television that five people had been wounded.\n\nAs Europe\u2019s biggest land conflict since World War Two entered its fifth month the Western alliance supporting Kyiv was starting to show signs of strain as leaders fret about the growing economic cost, including surging food and energy prices.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, speaking as Group of Seven leaders gathered for a summit in Germany, said the West needed to maintain a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cIn order to protect that unity, in order to make it work, you\u2019ve got to have really, really honest discussions about the implications of what\u2019s going on, the pressures that individual friends and partners are feeling,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cBut the price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed, to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest, that price will be far, far higher.\u201d\n\nLife had been returning to normal in Kyiv after fierce resistance held off Russian advances in the early phase of the war, although air raid sirens regularly sound across the city.\n\nThere had been no major strikes on Kyiv since June.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on the Telegram messaging app that Sunday\u2019s strike had partially destroyed a nine-storey apartment building and caused a fire.\n\n\u201cThere are people under the rubble,\u201d Klitschko said. \u201cThey have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they\u2019re trying to rescue her mother.\u201d\n\nExplosions were also heard on Sunday in the central city of Cherkasy, which has been largely untouched by bombardment so far, regional governor Oleksandr Skichko said on Telegram.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians, but Ukraine and the West accuse Russian forces of war crimes in a conflict that has killed thousands, sent millions fleeing the Ukraine and destroyed cities.\n\nThe strategic eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk fell to pro-Russian forces on Saturday after Ukrainian troops retreated, saying there was no longer anything to defend in the ruined city after months of fierce fighting.\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk is a major defeat for Kyiv as it seeks to keep control of the eastern Donbas region, a key military objective for the Kremlin.\n\nMoscow says the Donbas\u2019 Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, where it has backed uprisings since 2014, are independent countries. It demands Ukraine cede the entire territory of the two provinces to separatist administrations.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what the Kremlin calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to ensure Russian security and denazify the Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say the invasion was nothing more than a land grab.\n\nThe war has had a huge impact on the global economy and European security, driving up gas, oil and food prices, pushing the European Union to reduce reliance on Russian energy and prompting Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo said he would urge his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to start a dialogue during a peace-building mission to the warring countries and would ask Putin to order an immediate ceasefire.\n\n\u201cWar has to be stopped and global food supply chains need to be reactivated,\u201d Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said before leaving to attend the G7 summit.\n\nThe United Nations has warned that a protracted war in Ukraine, one of the world\u2019s major grain exporters, threatens to cause a global hunger crisis.\n\nSeeking to further tighten the screws on Russia, G7 countries announced an import ban on new gold from Russia as they started their summit in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nNATO leaders will hold a June 29-30 summit in Madrid.\n\nThe fall of Sievierodonetsk \u2013 once home to more than 100,000 people but now a wasteland \u2013 transforms the battlefield in the east after weeks in which Moscow\u2019s huge advantage in firepower had yielded only slow gains.\n\nRussia\u2019s Interfax news agency cited a representative of pro-Russian separatist fighters saying Russian and pro-Russian forces had also entered Lysychansk across the river.\n\nThe two cities were the last major cities held by Ukrainian forces in the east.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy vowed in a video address on Saturday that Ukraine would win back the cities it lost, including Sievierodonetsk.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a sense of how long it will last, how many more blows, losses and efforts will be needed before we see victory is on the horizon,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Ukrainian-held Donbas town of Pokrovsk, Elena, an elderly woman from Lysychansk in a wheelchair, was among dozens of evacuees who arrived by bus from frontline areas.\n\n\u201cLysychansk, it was a horror, the last week. Yesterday we could not take it any more,\u201d she said. \u201cI already told my husband if I die, please bury me behind the house.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Former Director-General of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Julie Okah-Donli, has stated that a former President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice should have obtained a clearance certificate from the agency before travelling to the United Kingdom with a kidney donor.\n\nOkah-Donli, who is also the Chairperson of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons (UNVTF), also revealed that most cases of organ harvesting in the country \u201care often treated as ritual murder by law enforcement agencies that lack the institutional capacity to handle such cases.\u201d\n\nShe clarified on Saturday during an interview on ARISE NEWS, while also lamenting the rate at which body organs of Nigerians \u201care stolen in India and most countries in the Middle East when they go for procedures.\u201d\n\nThe London Metropolitan Police had arrested Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice at Heathrow Airport, over an allegation of bringing a minor to the UK for organ harvesting.\n\nThe police had claimed that the investigation was launched after detectives were alerted to potential offences under the Modern Slavery Act, 2015 aimed at preventing hidden labour exploitation, payment for work-finding services and harvest of human organs, among others.\n\nConsequent to this, Ekweremadu and his wife were arraigned before the Uxbridge Magistrates\u2019 Court which denied them bail, ordered their detention and deferred the case till July 7 for a hearing.\n\nFaulting Ekweremadu for not observing the laws regulating all forms of organ donation, Okah-Donli explained the basic requirements all citizens should fulfil under the Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act, 2015 before travelling out of the country with kidney donors.\n\nShe said: \u201cIn a case like this, there is a regulation in place. NAPTIP ought to have issued them a clearance certificate to travel out of the country. However, it looks like NAPTIP was not even aware of it.\n\n\u201cUnder the legislation, NAPTIP has the right to issue a clearance certificate to any person who is going for anything relating to organ donation. Ekweremadu ought to have gone to NAPTIP to get a clearance certificate.\u201d\n\nDuring the process of issuing a clearance certificate, Okah-Donli explained that NAPTIP would have exhaustively interacted with the would-be donor before a clearance certificate would be issued to that effect.\n\nShe added that if the case had been reported, NAPTIP would have been able to investigate the case further with \u201ca view to finding out whether the donor is an adult or a minor, whether the donor understands the consequence of what he is going for or not.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all these things did not happen. The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) will only issue passports based on the information they are given. They are not going to look for information that they are not given.\n\n\u201cIf they say the boy in question is 50, the NIS will write 50 on the passport. But NAPTIP will have investigated in-depth, spoken to the donor and issued a clearance certificate before travelling out of the country. Unfortunately, the case was not brought to the attention of NAPTIP.\u201d\n\nThe former NAPTIP boss, therefore, lamented that the case of organ harvesting \u201cis really bad in Nigeria. It is huge across the federation but we have not paid attention to it. We have such cases in which people were found with their organs ripped out all over the federation.\u201d\n\nShe added that the authorities were quick to tag it ritual murder, noting that organ harvesting \u201chas been going on for so many years undetected.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP has the mandate to curb organ harvesting. Unfortunately, we have other law enforcement agencies that want to deal with it. But those agencies do not have the capacity to deal with it. They do not have the training.\n\n\u201cThese issues are not even referred to NAPTIP for proper investigation. We have that bottleneck in this area not allowing the appropriate agency to deal with the issue of organ harvesting. This is a very specialised area. Rushing to the conclusion that it is ritual murder will not help.\n\n\u201cEven in countries like India, they actually steal your organs. You go there for a procedure. By the time you go back, they have removed another organ. Stealing organs is something that has been going on in the Middle East,\u201d she explained.",

          "text": "Apparently bowing to pressure, Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday announced an indefinite extension of the ongoing voters\u2019 registration exercise.\n\nWith this indefinite extension, eligible Nigerians who have been struggling to meet the initial June 30 deadline for registration, will now experience relief.\n\nThe electoral umpire has also promised to issue Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to all registered voters by October just as it also pledged that the forthcoming governorship election in Osun State would be better than the just-concluded governorship election in Ekiti State.\n\nThis is coming as the European Union (EU) urged Nigerians not to sell their votes, stressing that vote-selling amounted to selling their future and enhancing bad governance.\n\nChairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this at the closing ceremony of the musical concert mobilised to sensitise eligible voters ahead of the general election.\n\nHe also pledged that votes would count in the 2023 general election while urging voters not to sell their votes.\n\n\u201cI assure you that the voters\u2019 registration exercise will not end on June 30 as earlier proposed.\n\nIt will continue till prospective voters register.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to register all who come out to register and ensure that all that are eligible get registered,\u201d Yakubu explained.\n\nSpeaking on the issuance of Permanent Voter Card (PVC), the INEC chairman said: \u201cAll of you that registered within this period will get their PVC by October this year.\u201d\n\nHe announced that between Monday to Friday when the musical concert started, 14,000 voters registered at Area 10 Old Parade Ground in Abuja.\n\nHe promised that more voting machines would be deployed to areas of need, while additional 50 voting machines would be made available to the Area 10 Old Parade Ground to ensure the registration of more voters.\n\n\u201cWe will not stop the registration exercise until eligible voters are registered,\u201d he added.\n\nThe INEC chairman cautioned against the use of PVC as a source of identity among Nigerians, stating that it is mainly meant for election and voting.\n\nSpeaking on subsequent elections, Yakubu said: \u201cIf you think that the Ekiti governorship election is good, I assure you that the coming governorship election in Osun State will be better and the 2023 general election will be the best \u201c.\n\nHe, however, called on the youths and other voters not to sell their votes and be peaceful in all elections, while pledging that he would ensure that their votes count in all elections.\n\nIn her speech, the European Union Ambassador to Nigeria, Samuella Isope, urged Nigerians not to sell their votes.\n\nShe argued that vote-selling amounts to modern enslavement and selling the future of the unborn generation.\n\nShe decried the growing youths\u2019 apathy to elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSince 2015 to 2019, the participation of youths in elections has been declining, but I hope that with what is happening here now, it will change the face of youths in future elections in Nigeria,\u201d she added.\n\nThe EU Ambassador urged the Nigerian youths not to sell their votes, saying, \u201cdon\u2019t allow anyone to steal your future because that is what vote-buying represents. Vote to get a better future for yourselves and your country,\u201d she said.\n\nShe commanded INEC and Yiaga Africa for their efforts in encouraging more eligible Nigerians to register in the ongoing voter registration exercise.\n\nThe musical concert witnessed a mass turnout that created heavy traffic between the Area 10 Function, International Conference Centre and the Navy and Popular Radio House.\n\nMany young musicians, including 2face and others performed at the concert.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria to Issue Prospecting Licences to Winners of Marginal Oilfields Bid, Pledges to Meet OPEC Production Quota by August",
          "text": "After a long wait, Nigeria\u2019s federal government, through the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), on Saturday said that it was set to issue Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) to successful awardees of marginal fields in the 2020 bid round.\n\nThe commission noted that the move was in fulfilment of the promise made early this year, pursuant to the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), 2021.\n\nA statement signed by the NUPRC Chief Executive, Mr Gbenga Komolafe, indicated that the event would hold on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThis is coming as the Minister of State for Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, at the weekend said the gap between Nigeria\u2019s oil production and the quota given to it by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be filled by August.\n\nThe marginal oil fields bid round, which commenced in 2020, had been bogged down by bureaucratic challenges, which prevented the winners from commencing the development of the fields over one year after the awardees were officially handed the initial certificates.\n\nOn May 30, 2021, the then Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) announced the conclusion of the exercise, the first since 2003, with the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator.\n\nThe regulator had put up 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore for lease, with 161 companies eventually shortlisted to advance to the final stage from 591 entities that applied for pre-qualification.\n\nHead of the DPR, which has now transformed into NUPRC, Mr Sarki Auwalu had at the time, stated that the exercise was worth roughly $500 million in signature bonuses.\n\nHowever, a number of the award winners had decried the slow turn of events, stressing that they had continued to pay heavy interests on the loans that were borrowed to pay for the transactions, despite that the loans had been unproductive for over a year.\n\nIn January, the NUPRC disclosed that the 2020 marginal field bid round concluded in 2021 had at the time, yielded about N174.944 billion, with owners of 30 fields having partially paid and two fields stalled by court cases.\n\nThe new commission further stated that 20 companies which won the bids had partially paid up, among those who won the 57 oilfields.\n\nBut in the statement issued Saturday, Komolafe stated that the event would also witness the unveiling of the implementation template for the Host Communities Development Trust Fund for the commencement of the provisions under Section 235 of the PIA, 2021.\n\nAccording to him, this will positively impact restiveness in the host communities and the process guarantees seamless operations and boost investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nFurthermore, the NUPRC chief executive stressed that it will provide enabling environment for sustainable development of the country\u2019s hydrocarbon resources.\n\n\u201cThese will mark the conclusion of some of the most urgent and critical tasks inherited by the commission when it was inaugurated in October 2021, after the signing into law of the PIA 2021,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe recalled that the commission had in March this year informed all participants in the 2020 marginal field bid round programme that it had put all necessary machinery in place to progress the bid round exercise to a conclusion in line with the PIA 2021.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of that resolution, the commission constituted an in-house work team to distil and address the concerns of awardees with a view to close-out issues affecting multiple awardees per asset and formation of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) by awardees in line with the respective letters of the award.\n\n\u201cAwardees were therefore enjoined to avail themselves of the resolution mechanism provided by the commission in the overriding national interest,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe NUPRC explained that the successful coordination and resolution of the issues culminated in the emergence of the successful awardees that would be handed over licences this week.\n\nMeanwhile, despite a huge gulf between Nigeria\u2019s current oil production compared to its expected OPEC monthly allocation, the Minister of State, Petroleum, Sylva, at the weekend said the gap would be filled by August.\n\nSylva who spoke during an online media conference also dispelled the notion that OPEC could turn on spare capacity and pump more, citing capacity concerns.\n\nThe comment came almost a year after similar assurances by the minister and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, that the country would drill enough oil to cover the deficit by December 2021.\n\nBut the aspiration expressed by the minister remains very ambitious as the latest OPEC market report indicated that Nigeria reported a paltry 1.024 million barrels per day production in May, quoting primary sources, a multi-year production low.\n\nIn all, the latest figure released by the OPEC, means that Nigeria\u2019s underperformance was as high as 700,000 barrels per day for the month, although the cartel\u2019s total allocation to Nigeria exceeded 1.75 million bpd for the month.\n\nThe 1.024 million bpd production was about 195,000 bpd less oil drilled last month when compared with April\u2019s total of 1.219 million bpd, OPEC said in the report.\n\nNigeria has a quota allowance to produce 1.77 million barrels a day in June and 1.80 million in July respectively.\n\nWhat the OPEC figures imply is that rather than improve, the country\u2019s oil production has deteriorated massively in the past months, although the authorities say efforts are being made to ramp up production.\n\nCiting massive theft as one of the reasons for its inability to meet its quota, the federal government had also months ago, deployed a heavy military presence in the Niger Delta to curb the menace. But even that move has not helped much.\n\nHowever, Sylva said during the interview that the country would be able to meet its OPEC production quota by the end of August as the country aims to boost security in its oil industry.\n\n\u201cFor us in Nigeria, we are at a low point. We are not able to meet our OPEC quota. We have given ourselves just about a month to ensure that we can \u2026 we believe that by August we would see some security improvement.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, there is a little capacity that can be brought to the market,\u201d the minister was quoted by Bloomberg and OilPrice.com as having said.\n\nThe perceived lack of spare capacity among many OPEC members has helped to keep oil prices high in recent months, despite lofty ambitions from the group regarding July production targets.\n\nThe July figure was set at 648,000 bpd higher than the June target and over a million bpd higher than the May target which OPEC is not meeting either.\n\nIf Nigeria manages to meet its August production target, it is expected to make a huge difference in the oil market which countries like the United States have complained is currently undersupplied.\n\nThe minister further said that the OPEC+ alliance of oil producers was running out of capacity to pump more crude, including its biggest member Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cSome people believe the prices to be a little bit on the high side and expect us to pump a little bit more but at this moment there is really little additional capacity.\n\n\u201cEven Saudi Arabia, Russia, of course, Russia, is out of the market now more or less,\u201d the minister added.\n\nThe extended group will meet next week Thursday to decide whether to proceed with a planned August oil production increase. Over the last year, the cartel has been boosting output in a series of planned increases.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, I think the prices are firming up and I don\u2019t think there will be any surprises in OPEC in August,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAside from not being able to produce enough, the country has an additional headache, with international majors selling and exiting onshore and shallow-water fields.\n\n\u201cStruggling even to meet the quota has been very sad for us and operators have planned to fill the gap within a couple of months,\u201d Sylva said.\n\n\u201cBy end of August, generally the commitment is that we\u2019re at least going to produce our OPEC quota and then of course look at going even beyond that after August,\u201d he added.\n\nLast Thursday, the federal government inaugurated a 10-man expert team to work on a report preceding the reactivation of over 3,000 shut-in oil strings, which the authorities say will help increase production in the coming months.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
