          "text": "Environmental Activist, Nnimmo Bassey has flayed the federal government for distributing commercial quantities of Genetically Modified Cowpea to farmers without informing them they were being given GM beans to plant.\n\nDismissing the excuse of the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) that it could not explain the concept of BT Cowpea to farmers before handing them out, Bassey explained that many poor farmers across Nigeria have already planted, harvested, eaten and sold the beans to the unsuspecting public.\n\nHe alleged that the agency merely told the farmers they were being given improved beans varieties, warning that \u2018\u2018deception is not a scientific tool for disseminating any product\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018Giving GMOs to farmers without their consent is illegal. The introduction of genetically engineered cowpea is a great cause for concern for farmers, consumers, and civil society organizations across the continent.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the prohibition of GM seeds in Nigeria. We need to stop the spread of these seeds because Africa must not be turned into a dumping ground for risky technologies.\n\n\u2018\u2018GM seeds decrease soil fertility, erode biodiversity, impoverish small scale farmers and promote land grab for monocultures.\n\nAccording to statistics, Nigeria has a yearly average production of about 2.7 million metric tons of beans and has maintained that standard in the last ten years.\n\nResearch shows that Nigeria is known worldwide as a centre for cowpea production and also the largest importer of cowpea in Africa, ironically.\n\nNnimmo Bassey, the convener, Home of Mother Earth Foundation, however, in a press statement warned of the adverse consequences of GM organisms in the environment and its implications for food and nutritional security.\n\n\u2018\u2018It has the long-term implications of transforming the environment, farmers\u2019 varieties, and production practices; it will trap farmers into unsustainable, unsuitable, and unaffordable farming practices, and deepen the threat to food and nutritional security.\n\nAlso calling on the government to ensure food safety, Dr Ifeanyi Casmir, a lecturer at the University of Abuja emphasized the dangers of genetic engineering.\n\nHe asked the government to unburden NAFDAC by reducing its scope of work to ensure efficiency, alleging that the work overload has led to the penetration of pesticides and other chemicals that have been banned elsewhere.",

          "text": "Speaker of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said voter education and enlightenment could address apathy and increase voter turnout in the forthcoming 2023 elections.\n\nGbajabiamila spoke at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Chatham House, on Thursday, where he presented a paper on \u2018Consolidating Nigeria\u2019s Democracy: Prospects for Strengthening Nigeria\u2019s Electoral Systems Ahead of 2023 Elections.\u2019\n\nHe said: \u201cVoter education and enlightenment campaigns can help increase the rate of voter participation, getting more people to believe that there is power in the vote and that a ballot can change the course of a nation and improve the conditions of its people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnhancing citizen participation,\u201d the Speaker said, \u201cis also about ensuring that the nation\u2019s diversity is reflected in the composition of its political actors. The variety of voices, perspectives and experiences can only improve the quality of debate and enhance the quality of outcomes.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila also emphasized the need to review the campaign laws of the country, especially in the area of finances for elections.\n\n\u201cClearly, we need to reform our campaign finance laws and the entire system through which we fund politics and political operations in the country. This would require amendments to both the constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cTo be effective, such campaign finance reform legislation will impose a financial reporting mandate on candidates and campaigns and impose severe penalties on violators,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe said that it may help clean up the flow of money into the political process, adding, \u201cbut there is a real risk that this ends up making the process more expensive by creating regulatory compliance costs.\n\n\u201cSo, as we consider this option, we will consider others too and remain open to new ideas.\u201d\n\nLooking back, the Speaker outlined the steps taken by the National Assembly to ensure substantial improvement to the Nigerian electoral system, saying, \u201cAfter every election cycle, the National Assembly has initiated steps to document experiences, extrapolate lessons learned and, on that basis, amend the electoral laws to plug gaps and remove bottlenecks.\n\n\u201cEach electoral amendment effort reflects a considered attempt to provide a more robust statutory framework for elections. From the internal party processes to the final declaration of results and even pre and post-election litigation.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the Independent National Electoral Commission has in the last decade shown a remarkable willingness to learn from its own mistakes, embrace new technology, engage stakeholders and take proactive action to ensure public faith in the electioneering process.\n\n\u201cThey, and indeed the legislature, have often been helped in our joint efforts by aid and support from our international friends who understand that Nigeria\u2019s democracy has been hard-won and deserves to be protected by all prudent and necessary means.\u201d\n\nHe however outlined the efforts the parliament and indeed government had made towards ensuring the forthcoming elections are free, fair and credible.\n\n\u201cIn the 2022 Appropriations Bill, the legislature has made provisions to allow both the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies to make adequate plans for these contingencies.\n\n\u201cAnd I am aware that in addition to funding issues, efforts are already underway to prepare for the unique challenges we face as we plan to deliver free, fair and credible elections across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAcknowledging that democracy in Nigeria is still young and fragile, Gbajabiamila said sustaining it requires dedicated efforts as the success or failure of the 2023 elections would impact the Nigerian people, the African continent and indeed, the world.",

Let them write it inside water or anywhere, they will fail and they have failed,\u201d Adeola declared.\n\nThe Senate Committee Chairman on Finance spoke at his hometown in Ilaro, headquarters of Yewa South Local Government Area while fielding questions from news men some minutes after announcing that he had fully relocated to Ogun State for politics.\n\nHe also disclosed that he had moved his Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) registration documentations from Lagos to Ogun State for full participation in Ogun West 2023 senatorial seat race.\n\nThe Lagos West Senator explained that poor representation at the National Assembly and clarion calls by his people to come back home informed why he set aside \u201call the comforts\u201d which politicking afforded him in Lagos State and returned home.\n\nAside from re-registering his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Adeola said he has also swapped his INEC\u2019s Permanent Voters\u2019 Card (PVC) to Ogun State.\n\nHe informed he would be casting his votes at the Ward 01, Polling Unit 009 in Ilaro, declaring \u201cand no going back\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have chosen to take this bold step because I believe that at a point in time of every man\u2019s life, you must chose what you want to do and take a bold decision.\n\n\u201cThis is however one of the bold decisions that I have to take if truly I want to do politics in Ogun State\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in the legality, as well as the moral implication of his action, the Senator declared that his action has neither violated any known section of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria nor that of the APC as a political party.\n\n\u201cThere is no question of moral deficiency here. My senatorial seat in Lagos State is never threatened, even if I choose to contest again in Lagos State, I will still win.\n\n\u201cWhile I was representing Lagos State, I was equally contributing my quotas to Ogun West politics. Lagos platform was a training ground for me and the time for me is now, to put all my trainings into practice.

In the South East, the exercise is taking place in Enugu and it is an important step in the party\u2019s preparations for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cBut, because there is no governorship election coming up in 2023 in Imo State where there is already an All Progressives Congress (APC) in place and Anambra where an All Progressives Grand Alliance Government (APGA) government was recently installed, based on an off-season election, the screening in the Southeast is only holding for Enugu, Abia, and Ebonyi aspirants.\n\n\u201cSo, I have gone to meet with the panel and I have been successfully screened.

          "title": "Buhari to court: Electoral Act 84 (12) unconstitutional",
          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Eric Ikhilae, Abuja\n\nSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 cannot stand, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami (SAN) told a court yesterday.\n\nThey insisted that the section contravenes constitutional provisions and ought to be voided.\n\nPresident Buhari faulted a claim by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that he directed the National Assembly to delete Section 84(12).\n\nHe said, being conscious of the democratic principle of separation of powers, he merely expressed reservations about the provision.\n\nHe and the AGF argued that the constitutionality or otherwise of the provision has been settled by the March 18, 2022 judgment of Justice Evelyn Ayandike of the Federal High Court, Umuahia.\n\nThey noted that the section could only be restored by a decision of the Court of Appeal.\n\nPresident Buhari and Malami\u2019s position is contained in a joint counter-affidavit they filed in the suit numbered FHC/ABJ/CS/247/2022 by the PDP.\n\nThe party seeks to restrain the National Assembly from deleting the clause as allegedly directed by the President.\n\nThe President and the AGF argued that the section \u201cprejudices and impedes the constitutional rights of most Nigerians to participate in the electoral processes or primaries of their political parties and freely choose their preferred leaders/ candidates who are aspirants/political appointees in public service and deny the aspirants/political appointees in public service the right to vote or be voted for in the electoral process of the parties.\u201d\n\nIn a notice of preliminary objection filed along with the joint counter affidavit by their legal team, including Oladipo Okpeseyi (SAN) and Prof Yemi Akinseye-George (SAN), President Buhari and Malami faulted the competence of the suit and urged the court to decline jurisdiction to hear it.\n\nListed with President Buhari and the AGF as defendants are the Senate President, House of Representatives Speaker, the Clerk to the National Assembly, the Senate Leader, the House Leader and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOthers are the Deputy Senate President, the Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Senate Leader, the Deputy House Leader and the Allied Peoples\u2019 Movement (APM).\n\nPresident Buhari and Malami said: \u201cThe first defendant (Buhari) assented to the Electoral Bill 2022 on February 25, 2022, but did not give condition or directives to the National Assembly in the manner erroneously deposed to by the plaintiff or in any other manner that is inconsistent with the autonomy and independence of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAt no time did the first defendant give any directive to the management or leadership of the third to seventh defendants and the ninth to 12th defendants as regards removal of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 from the Act.\n\n\u201cPrior to assenting to the Electoral Bill 2022, the first defendant merely expressed his observation and concerns about the constraints of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 on serving public office holders/political appointees but gave his assent, to avoid further delay, as time was of the essence.\u201d\n\nThe President recalled that on March 8, he officially wrote to the National Assembly leadership to express his concerns about the section and formally requested for its amendment \u201cto eliminate areas of infractions with the Constitution\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari and Malami said they \u201ctruly and firmly believe that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 disenfranchises and discriminates against Nigerians in public service or public office holders, who are political appointees and prevents them from engaging in the electoral processes in exercise of their inalienable rights in a participatory democracy\u201d.\n\nBesides, they said it was in conflicts with what is \u201calready elaborately provided for by the extant Constitution\u201d.\n\nThey added that they had never taken it upon themselves to declare Section 84(12) or any provision of the Electoral Act, 2022 unconstitutional, as such a declaration was beyond their constitutional powers.\n\n\u201cThe first and second defendants do not meddle or interfere with the functions of the Judiciary as the interpreter and guardian of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 is inconsistent with Sections 1(3), 42, 65, 66 particularly sections 66 (1) (f), 106 and 107 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe invalidation by this court of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 will not adversely affect the aims and objectives of the plaintiff or of any other political party of promoting internal democracy of political parties in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe settled provision of Nigerian law with respect to office holders and political appointees is that such person employed in the public service shall resign from such employment 30 days before the date of election,\u201d the first and second defendants added.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo adjourned till May 16 for definite hearing.\n\nAPC drops guideline on resignation\n\nAlso yesterday, the All Progressives Congress (APC) amended a section in its guidelines for primaries on resignation of political office holders.\n\nThe party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) decided to leave the fate of political office holders, including ministers, commissioners and other appointees, to the court.\n\nThe amendment was also said to be in line with President Buhari\u2019s opposition to Section 84(12).\n\nInvestigation revealed that Section 3(i) of the APC\u2019s final guidelines for the conduct of primaries had caused uproar in the party.\n\nThe section says: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cAny political office holder interested in contesting for an elective office shall leave office 30 days prior to the date of election or party primary for the office sought.\u201d\n\nSome ministers, who are interested in presidential and governorship offices, have not been comfortable with the disputed section.\n\nA top source said: \u201cThere has been a row in the party over the section because members felt that it will disenfranchise some aspirants.\n\n\u201cSome of our leaders claimed that 1999 Constitution only mandates a candidate (not aspirant) to resign one month before contesting for any elective office.\n\n\u201cBased on cogent reasons and the need for fairness, the NWC has dropped the guideline on resignation because it is at variance with 84 (12) of the Electoral Act which is silent on timeline for resignation. The Act is not specific on the time politically appointed persons are expected to resign before primary elections.\n\n\u201cAs NWC, we cannot issue guidelines outside the law of the land.

Click Here For Details .\n\nIn the process leading to the consensus exercise, the quartet visited Gen Babangida and gave him the mandate to lead the move for a consensus candidate and agreed to abide by the outcome of the decision. The former president encouraged the aspirants to resolve within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one of them.\n\nBut General Babangida opted for inclusion through wider consultations and assigned one of the elder statesmen in the North, Prof Ango Abdullahi, to design some criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with elders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\n\nOut of the four aspirants, Bauchi governor and former Senate president emerged as preferred choices, but Tambuwal rejected the outcome claiming that the Northern leaders did not follow due process.\n\nMeanwhile, Northern elderstatesman and former Vice Chancellor, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Professor Ango Abdullahi, has said zoning of the presidency is dead and buried.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nTo this end, he called on political parties to forget zoning of presidency to a particular region\n\nHe advised that those seeking to contest for the Presidency should be allowed to do so on the merit of their competence and not where they come from.\n\nHe added that such positions should be left open for standard norms of democratic processes.\n\nProfessor Abdullahi, who is the Convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) stated this at his Zaria residence while reacting to the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) leadership who paid him a visit.\n\nThe elder statesman who disclosed that over 11 presidential aspirants which cut across various political parties have visited him in Zaria for his candid advice, prayers and support, adding that, election of who becomes President of Nigeria should be left open and winner allowed to emerge regardless of where he or she comes from.\n\n\u201cThe issue of zoning or power shift is dead and buried, candidates should be allowed to contest election on the basis of merit of their competence and not where they come from, hence the Northern Elders Forum is of the opinion that the presidential position should be left open for standard norms of democractic process.\u201d\n\nOn the controversial PDP consensus process that produced Saraki from North Central and Governor Mohammed from North East, he said: \u201cThe aspirants insisted on us choosing from among them but we told them it was not possible, so we consulted elders from across the North West, North Central and North East before Tambuwal and Atiku Abubakar withdrew from the process.\n\n\u201cAll elders voted for first and second choice and Bukola Saraki and Governor Bala Mohammed tied and both of them were asked to either pick one among themselves or do further consultation on the best among them and our recommendation was signed by me as Ango Abdullahi and not onbehalf of NEF, a position I made very clear at a press conference I addressed in Minna\u201d.\n\nWhile lamenting leadership failure in the country, he challenged any one to a debate on the state of the nation, stressing that, \u201cwhat is killing us is self serving\u201d.\n\nEarlier, spokesperson of the CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman said: \u201cWe, at the CNG, will continue to look up to you as a great statesman, a mentor, a guardian, a living history and an embodiment of all the exemplary qualities young Northerners should strive to achieve.\n\n\u201cWe finally urge you to remain steadfast in providing leadership advice for strong resistance to the antics of these political dealers desperately seeking to market the worst, unproductive, inefficient individuals with no record of credence in all their endeavours on the people as candidates from the North.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*Umar expresses dismay, appeals for international community\u2019s intervention\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe photograph of a new-born baby girl delivered in a terrorists\u2019 den by a mother abducted during the March 28 attack on an Abuja-Kaduna-bound train has been released by the abductors.\n\nFormer military governor of Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Umar (rtd.), told THISDAY the development was \u201cso sad and very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nUmar reiterated his call on the international community to intervene in the matter. He also faulted a portion of the bill seeking to amend the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2013 that prohibited payment of ransom to kidnappers in the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe world must know what is happening. This government is trying to cover up this and we all must keep talking about this. Before you know it, these people would spend 10 years, like the Chibok girls. There are thousands of kidnapped victims in northern Nigeria, but the governments don\u2019t want people to talk about it.\n\n\u201cTwenty-four hours ago, the senators passed a bill that anybody that pays ransom would be jailed. Can you imagine that? If the federal government cannot avert kidnapping and cannot rescue these people, what do you do?\u201d\n\nThe terrorist group suspected to be Ansaru, a breakaway group from Boko Haram, THISDAY gathered, released the picture of the new baby seen yesterday, on Wednesday night.\n\nARISE News Channel and THISDAY had two days ago reported the birth of the new baby by the abductee in the terrorists\u2019 den. A family member of the woman had first hinted that she had been delivered of her baby, although the identity of the new-born child was not disclosed until the terrorists released her picture.\n\nClad in a thick pink dress and a light lemon sweater cap, with her eyes closed, the baby looked healthy, with credible sources saying the terrorists invited a doctor to take the delivery of the infant.\n\nOut of the 63 abducted train passengers that were under captivity, only one passenger, Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA), Alwan Hassan, has so far been released after, allegedly, paying a ransom of N100 million.\n\nTHISDAY reported on Tuesday that one of the two pregnant women among the passengers kidnapped during the attack by the terrorists had been delivered of her baby.\n\nThe state of the other pregnant woman was not known by yesterday.\n\nThe terrorists, who attacked and abducted the passengers, had earlier this week released four different pictures of their victims, numbering 62, with the group allegedly insisting that they were not after a ransom, but an exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were in government custody.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, had at a recent media briefing revealed that the federal government was working behind the scenes to secure the release of all the hostages currently languishing in captivity.\n\nNine persons, including a young medical doctor, were killed during the attack, with scores injured and over 60 passengers kidnapped.\n\nReliable sources said the terrorists appeared organised and coordinated because of the way they were able to get medical supplies into the forest, a development they described as still shocking to both government and security operatives.\n\nUmar had on Wednesday appealed to the federal government to do more to secure the release of victims of the Kaduna train abduction. In a statement issued in Kaduna, Umar had said the pictures of the victims, which trended on the social media, was disturbing. He appealed to the international community, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations with the terrorists to secure the release of the victims. He prayed God to touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on their innocent and vulnerable victims.\n\nUmar had stated, \u201cThe pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release.\n\n\u201cMay God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims.

          "title": "IMF: Fuel Subsidy Causing Deterioration in Fiscal Balance in Nigeria",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday maintained that prolonged payment of petrol subsidy in Nigeria was affecting the country\u2019s fiscal balance despite revenue increase from rise in global oil price.\n\nThe Washington-based institution stated this in its latest Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa titled: \u201cA New Shock and Little Room to Maneuver,\u201d released yesterday.\n\nIt stated: \u201cNet commodity exporters can receive fiscal windfalls only if they contain subsidy expenditures. For example, some oil exporters provide expensive and generalised energy subsidies to the domestic population which could lead to a deterioration in fiscal balances despite the revenue increase associated with higher export prices in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTherefore, removing generalised subsidies is crucial to ensure that the rise in commodity prices generates fiscal savings. It is then essential that these savings are directed largely to strengthening fiscal sustainability supported by strong governance frameworks, given the precarious conditions faced by many countries.\u201d\n\nThe fund reiterated that the country\u2019s foreign exchange policy was weighing on its growth, distorting investment, encouraging rent seeking. It also noted uncertainties in the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe multilateral institution also pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s growth was stronger than anticipated due to increase in manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cFor countries with limited reserves, authorities have sometimes offered favorable rates, including to specific sectors. But the resulting parallel market for foreign exchange in Nigeria and Zimbabwe can weigh on growth distorting investment, encouraging rent seeking, and adding to uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThe decision to return to a more unified framework is often difficult, but experience suggests that the shift to a market-clearing official rate is not in itself likely to lead to a sharp increase in inflation, as prices in the real economy tend to reflect the less-favorable parallel exchange rate; and removing exchange-market distortions can give a substantial boost to development, by reducing uncertainty and strengthening competitiveness.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the exchange reform implemented in South Sudan last year prompted a significant appreciation of the parallel market rate, helping to reduce inflation and insulating the country from rising global food prices,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report further reiterated that Nigeria\u2019s economic growth was expected to reach 3.4 percent in 2022, falling back to 2.9 per cent from 2024 onwards.\n\nIt added: \u201cNigeria\u2019s growth outlook has improved through higher oil prices and a stronger-than-anticipated recovery of manufacturing and agriculture. Growth is expected to reach 3.4 percent in 2022, falling back to 2.9 percent from 2024 onwards.\n\n\u201cThe outlook is subject to high uncertainty associated with oil prices and financial conditions. Moreover, low vaccination rates, rising security risks, and elevated price pressures weigh negatively on the medium-term growth outlook. Diversification away from oil will be critical to raise growth potential sustainably and reduce volatility.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Director of the IMF\u2019s African Department Abebe Aemro Selassie, while speaking on the report during a virtual media briefing at the ongoing IMF/World Bank spring meeting yesterday, noted that the recovery in sub-Saharan Africa picked up in the third quarter of 2021 and held up despite the onset of a fourth COVID-19 wave at the end of the year.\n\nHe said Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s estimated growth in 2021 had been revised upward from 3.7 per cent to 4.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cHigher oil prices may generate a windfall gain for the region\u2019s 8 oil exporters. But for the other 37 countries, they will worsen trade imbalances and increase living costs.\n\n\u201cIndeed, over the past couple of months we have increased our inflation projections significantly lifting the regional average for 2022 by a full four percentage points, and representing the worst outcome since 2008.\n\n\u201cThis year, eleven countries will face double digit inflation; almost all of these have flexible exchange rates, and almost half of these are fragile.\n\n\u201cFor most countries, the new crisis comes at an extremely difficult time as the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, fiscal and international buffers are already under strain, and policy space is limited.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond the pandemic and current geopolitical tensions, creating jobs and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals will require strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nZenith Bank Plc has announced its unaudited results for the first quarter (Q1) ended 31st March 2022, with an impeccable growth of 22 per cent in gross earnings, from N157.3 billion reported in Q1 2021 to N191.5 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nFrom the unaudited statement of account presented to the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) yesterday, the strong double-digit growth in the topline culminated in an increase in the bottom line, as the Group recorded an 11 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in profit before tax, growing from N61.02 billion in Q1 2021 to N67.99 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nIts profit after tax also grew by 10 per cent, from N53.06 billion to N58.19 billion over the same period. The growth in the topline arose from both interest income and non-interest income.\n\nInterest income grew by 25 per cent, from N101.12 billion in Q1 2021 to N126.38 billion in Q1 2022, while non-interest income grew by 12 per cent, from N51.20 billion to N57.23 billion.\n\nThe growth in interest income and non-interest income arose from the combined effects of an improvement in interest income on loans and advances (as risk assets continue to grow and pricing is gradually improving) and an improvement in non-interest income as the bank continued to deploy its retail strategy, thereby acquiring more customers and expanding its electronic banking income from the increased volume of transactions across all its channels.\n\nIts total assets grew by nine per cent, from N9.45 trillion to N10.32 trillion in 2022, mainly driven by growth in customers\u2019 deposits. Customer deposits grew by 12 per cent, from N6.47 trillion in December 2021, to N7.25 trillion in March 2022. Savings account balance, which is solely retail grew by over N68 billion and was a validation of the robust customer acquisition strategy and versatile electronic platforms and digital channels.\n\nLoans and advances also grew by six per cent, from N3.5 trillion in December 2021, to N3.7 trillion in March 2022, boosting the Group\u2019s interest income and displaying the Group\u2019s appetite for high-yielding risk assets creation.\n\nThis development also helped to boost the net interest margin (NIM), as it improved from six per cent in March 2021, to 7.3 per cent in the current period, while the capital adequacy ratio improved slightly from 21.1 per cent to 22.1 per cent.\n\n\u201cGoing into the remainder of 2022, the Group would continue to focus on sustainable growth across all its business segments and deploy technology platforms and digital assets intuitively to serve its various customers\u2019 needs to deliver enhanced returns to its stakeholders,\u201d the bank stated.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s track record of excellent performance has earned the brand numerous awards, including being voted as Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards, for three consecutive years from 2020 to 2022, Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance\u2019 Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. Also, the Bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says publishing governor\u2019s character flaws in public interest\n\nBlessing Ibunge\n\n\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the suit by Governor Nyesom Wike against THISDAY newspaper and others on alleged libel yesterday, the defense witness, Mr. Jude Igbanoi, presented more video evidences to show the unreliability of the state governor.\n\nThe video further showed that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was not libelous. Igbanoi also rejected the assertion by the complainant\u2019s counsel that the publication was reckless, insisting that the publication was fair comment on a matter of public interest.\n\nThe court watched video of Wike as the Director General of Godwin Obaseki Campaign Organisation campaigning for Obaseki\u2019s re-election and saying good things about Obaseki only to turn round a few years later to be attacking his character. The court also watched video clips of Wike as the Director General of Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s campaign organisation, where he was praising the former governor of Rivers State to high heaven only for him to change and started attacking him which THISDAY argued buttresses his (Wike\u2019s) unreliability.\n\nDuring the cross examination, the witness, Igbanoi, argued that the publication by THISDAY did not make Wike\u2019s political associates and friends to shun or abandon him. The publication did affect his relationships and did not make him lose any privilege or opportunities that would have come his way. He was appointed Director General of Obaseki Campaign Organisation despite the publication an indication that the publication clearly did not injure his public perception.\n\nThe court at the end of the cross examination of the first witness for the defendant adjourned till May 20, to begin cross examination of the second witness.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY outside the courtroom, the defense counsel, Tuduru Edeh, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, explained that: \u201cThe sitting yesterday concentrated on playing exhibit F and L, which were videos namely where Wike was campaigning for Amaechi as his campaign director for his governorship election and he praised Amaechi to high heavens.\n\n\u201cIt was played to demonstrate that, that was the position he had, but it is a different story today having fallen out with Amaechi.\n\n\u201cThe first video was to show that even though the man claimed libels but going through the videos you see a man who was made Director General of Obaseki\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nEdeh added that: \u201cThe witness emphasised that he (Wike) was not shunned, political associates did not abandon him as a result of the publication he is complaining about.\n\n\u201cThe matter was adjourned till May 20 for continuation of hearing, for us to bring our second witness.\u201d\n\nJustice Adolphus Enebeli of the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, adjourned till May 20, 2022 to continue hearing on the suit.\n\nAt the resumed hearing on the matter, the lead counsel to Wike, Emmanuel Ukala, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, put to the witness for the defendant that the publication made by THISDAY was reckless and could negatively affect the image of the claimant.\n\nLast month, the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had also watched video clips tendered by THISDAY.

Not that this was planned. But, as usual, such a gathering always affords us the opportunity to critically look at the state of the nation, particularly, now being an election season. Yes, we\u2019re \u2013 all networking and programming for the 2023 elections,\u201d said one of the political leaders, who is also in Saudi for Umrah.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We cannot afford to fail. We cannot afford to veer off-course.\u201d\n\nCHRIS NGIGE\n\nChris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, on April 19, formally made known his intention to contest the presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNgige threw his hat in the ring before an excited crowd at Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra state.\n\nThe minister said his extensive experience in public office gives him the capacity to perform well as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHUKWUEMEKA NWAJIUBA\n\nOn Wednesday, a support group, known as Project Nigeria, bought the expression of interest and nomination forms for Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, minister of state for education, to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the minister said Buhari has achieved \u201cextraordinary feats\u201d in the last seven years, adding that a lot of work needs to be done.\n\nCommenting on calls for the resignation of presidential hopefuls in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, Nwajiuba said: \u201cThe resignation of a minister or anybody who is in office is guided by the constitution to contest elections.\n\n\u201cMy position is that the law of the country rests on the ground norm called the constitution. If you do not like the constitution, your work is to amend it. There is no subrogation of power that is required for you to include into a law what is not deemed as included in that law.\u201d\n\nRUMOURED PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS\n\nWhile the aforementioned cabinet members have publicly declared their intentions, some others are believed to be interested in the top job but are yet to take a definite position.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu, minister of science and technology; Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta affairs; and Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, fall into this category.\n\nAlthough Godwin Emfiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is rumoured to be interested in the presidency, the top banker has said he is focused on his job.\n\nGOVERNORSHIP HOPEFULS\n\nABUBAKAR MALAMI\n\nOn Thursday, Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), announced his intention to contest the governorship of Kebbi state in 2023, putting an end to months of speculation.\n\nEarly this month, media reports had quoted the minister of justice as declaring to run for governor.\n\nBut Malami denied the news, saying a video wherein he spoke was \u201ctranslated with fabricated insertions\u201d.\n\nWhen he eventually declared his governorship ambition, Malami said he had accepted the people\u2019s calls to run.\n\n\u201cThe chairman of the party has announced the commencement of sale of forms for aspirants. My fellow people, let me let you know in this gathering that a lot of people have been calling on me to declare that I will contest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you have accepted, then from my own end, I have accepted to contest.\u201d\n\nRUMOURED GOVERNORSHIP HOPEFULS\n\nWhile Malami has finally put speculations to rest by joining the Kebbi guber race, other members of Buhari\u2019s cabinet are rumoured to be nursing similar ambitions.\n\nIsa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, belongs to this group, as he is said to be interested in running for governor of Gombe state.\n\nLast month, some residents in Gombe filed an order of mandamus in the state high court to compel him to join the governorship race.\n\n\u201cTo demonstrate our commitment to this cause is to use the law to compel professor Isa Ali Pantami to perform his duty in Gombe state by vying for the upcoming primaries in any party of his choice. This legal action was entered by 114 persons across the 114 wards, and like-minded youths have decided to buy his nomination form,\u201d Muhammad Abdullahi, leader of the group, had said.\n\nAnother rumoured governorship hopeful is Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, who is said to be eyeing the governorship seat in Oyo \u2014 a report he has denied.\n\nSpeaking in an interview in October 2021, the minister had said: \u201cNo plans for governorship. My plan right now is to succeed at the assignment given to me by President Muhammadu Buhari for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nUche Ogah, minister of state for mines and steel development, is another cabinet member who is reportedly nursing a governorship ambition.

We cannot afford to veer off-course.\u201d\n\nCHRIS NGIGE\n\nChris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, on April 19, formally made known his intention to contest the presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNgige threw his hat in the ring before an excited crowd at Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra state.\n\nThe minister said his extensive experience in public office gives him the capacity to perform well as president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCHUKWUEMEKA NWAJIUBA\n\nOn Wednesday, a support group, known as Project Nigeria, bought the expression of interest and nomination forms for Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, minister of state for education, to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the minister said Buhari has achieved \u201cextraordinary feats\u201d in the last seven years, adding that a lot of work needs to be done.\n\nCommenting on calls for the resignation of presidential hopefuls in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, Nwajiuba said: \u201cThe resignation of a minister or anybody who is in office is guided by the constitution to contest elections.\n\n\u201cMy position is that the law of the country rests on the ground norm called the constitution. If you do not like the constitution, your work is to amend it. There is no subrogation of power that is required for you to include into a law what is not deemed as included in that law.\u201d\n\nRUMOURED PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS\n\nWhile the aforementioned cabinet members have publicly declared their intentions, some others are believed to be interested in the top job but are yet to take a definite position.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu, minister of science and technology; Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta affairs; and Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, fall into this category.\n\nAlthough Godwin Emfiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is rumoured to be interested in the presidency, the top banker has said he is focused on his job.\n\nGOVERNORSHIP HOPEFULS\n\nABUBAKAR MALAMI\n\nOn Thursday, Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), announced his intention to contest the governorship of Kebbi state in 2023, putting an end to months of speculation.\n\nEarly this month, media reports had quoted the minister of justice as declaring to run for governor.\n\nBut Malami denied the news, saying a video wherein he spoke was \u201ctranslated with fabricated insertions\u201d.\n\nWhen he eventually declared his governorship ambition, Malami said he had accepted the people\u2019s calls to run.\n\n\u201cThe chairman of the party has announced the commencement of sale of forms for aspirants. My fellow people, let me let you know in this gathering that a lot of people have been calling on me to declare that I will contest,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you have accepted, then from my own end, I have accepted to contest.\u201d\n\nRUMOURED GOVERNORSHIP HOPEFULS\n\nWhile Malami has finally put speculations to rest by joining the Kebbi guber race, other members of Buhari\u2019s cabinet are rumoured to be nursing similar ambitions.\n\nIsa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, belongs to this group, as he is said to be interested in running for governor of Gombe state.\n\nLast month, some residents in Gombe filed an order of mandamus in the state high court to compel him to join the governorship race.\n\n\u201cTo demonstrate our commitment to this cause is to use the law to compel professor Isa Ali Pantami to perform his duty in Gombe state by vying for the upcoming primaries in any party of his choice. This legal action was entered by 114 persons across the 114 wards, and like-minded youths have decided to buy his nomination form,\u201d Muhammad Abdullahi, leader of the group, had said.\n\nAnother rumoured governorship hopeful is Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, who is said to be eyeing the governorship seat in Oyo \u2014 a report he has denied.\n\nSpeaking in an interview in October 2021, the minister had said: \u201cNo plans for governorship. My plan right now is to succeed at the assignment given to me by President Muhammadu Buhari for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nUche Ogah, minister of state for mines and steel development, is another cabinet member who is reportedly nursing a governorship ambition. The minister is said to be eyeing the number one office in Abia state.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This list will be updated as more cabinet members declare their political ambitions.",

          "title": "Why are ethnicity, zoning dominant issues of 2023 elections?",
          "text": "A plus ca change. Leadership fails, followership fails; society atrophies and nothing changes. Why? We keep reinventing purgatory because we are either too complacent or too self-absorbed to interrogate the real issues of leadership, divorcing provincial proclivities. We want change and good governance but have refused to levitate above the insular mentation that has kept us bound in the abyss of retrogression.\n\nWhy are concerns over ethnicity, region and religion the nominators of conversation on the 2023 elections? Why are these societal retardants the leading matters of debate on the elections? In every election cycle, these misnomers have become the fundamental benchmark for selecting leaders by political parties and for electing the same by citizens?\n\nAre we predestined to remain on this primrose path? Is there no hope for a change? Why are conversations not primarily on proven administrative competence, but on which region, ethnic group and religion the next president must come from? Yes, even if consideration should be given for the ethnic and religious backgrounds of the next president, this should only be secondary. The priority should be on who can deliver the goods for all Nigerians? Who are those candidates that can nurse and heal a divided Nigeria back to health? Who are those candidates with more than smattering knowledge of everything \u2013 security and economy especially? And these individuals must have proved their worth, capacity, character and competence in previous offices. Antecedents matter.\n\nWhile we fixate over primordial concerns, we lose sight of the most important matters. We dispense too much energy on trivialities, and leaving little to interrogate those who have come forward to represent us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Nigerians, regardless of ethnicity and religion, belong in the axis of competence. Political parties should zone presidential ticket to this \u201cregion\u201d. Character, antecedents, history of demonstrated patriotism and respect for diversity, proven leadership competence should be the leading issues as we head for the 2023 elections.\n\nThere is a winning argument for inclusion as regards zoning of political offices, but in our case, it appears zoning is just an end and not a means to better governance.\n\nAs I said earlier, even if ethnicity, region and religion are to be criteria for selecting Nigeria\u2019s next president for the sake of \u2018\u2019justice, equity and fairness\u2019\u2019 as propounded by those calling for an orbiting in the geography of power, this should not take precedence over the principal issues of leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, I shared my thoughts on variegated issues leading to the 2023 elections on the popular television programme, \u201cVillage Square Africa\u201d on News Central TV, hosted by veteran and award-winning broadcast journalist, Sulaiman Aledeh.\n\nI will reproduce a bit of what I said here.\n\nSulaiman: On the issues guiding the elections, what do you have to say on what is playing out in the country?\n\nFred: \u201cIt is an interesting time; I believe we will have an election in 2023 where an incumbent president will not be running, and it makes it much more interesting because it is an open ticket. Any party or anybody can take it because the power of incumbency is limited in this case. We have clamours for political parties to cede the presidential ticket to the south, and of course, it has been a back and forth. There are arguments for and against that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPersonally, I believe what we should be talking about now is competence. Political parties should zone their presidential tickets to the geography of competence. If I should rephrase that, political parties should zone their presidential tickets to the axis of competence, capacity and character.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem we have had over the years. We emphasise ethnicity and religion. Some of the presidential hopefuls that have shown interest have been toeing this path. We have a problem of putting emphasis on what should be secondary and not on primary matters of competence, character, ability, antecedents and proven track record of leadership \u2014 which should ordinarily be the issues that should guide the 2023 elections. But unfortunately, we are seeing religion and ethnicity being the topmost issues in this season. The questions are \u2014 what has zoning done for us over the years? How has zoning changed Nigeria?\n\n\u2018\u2019The problem is when you cede a presidential ticket to a particular zone on the basis of \u2018it is our turn\u2019, the person who is coming to contest is coming to represent his region and not Nigerians. We should be talking about a Nigerian president not an Igbo president. That is why I totally repudiate the phrase \u2014 Igbo presidency \u2014 it is wrong to say Igbo presidency. These are some of the things we need to correct.\n\n\u201cWe need a Nigerian president not a president of the south-east, the south-west or the north. A president that will represent all Nigerians; that will be for all Nigerians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been through this path before. When you start ceding or start amplifying ethnic agenda and issues, the person who emerges will want to favour his own side of the country because he believes that he is at the presidency to represent his region.\u201d\n\nIf we want to do better, we must know better. Making the 2023 elections about an ethnic group or region is reinventing a bogey. We should elevate our thinking and conversations beyond the crude and primitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nMy day didn\u2019t start well for me yesterday. A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Please take a look at it in the next story.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show you the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly on Saturday, April 23, 2022, I was at home, relaxing and watching a movie. But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain awareness and user education is a background check that must be done to foster blockchain adoption. Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey?

          "text": "Just a simple greeting\n\nSpeaker A: Good morning, GAB. Happy Monday!\n\nGAB: Good morning! Have a red-letter day, too!\n\nSpeaker A: GAB, what is red doing in your greeting now? Is red not danger?\n\nGAB: A red-letter day is a day that is pleasantly noteworthy or memorable.\n\nSpeaker A: You should have just used \u2018memorable\u2019. I don\u2019t like the \u2018red\u2019. So have a great day!\n\nGAB: Noted! Do have a stupendous day, too!\n\nSpeaker A: Hai! Why does that sound like stupid?\n\nGAB: Oh, no! Stupendous means awesome or marvellous.\n\nSpeaker A: But, GAB, you could just have said \u2018marvellous\u2019. Why do you like trouble? Anyway, have a nice day!\n\nGAB: I wish you a terrific one, too.\n\nSpeaker A: But why are you doing this?\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t date a grammarian!\n\nGirlfriend: (Chatting) How are you?\n\nBoyfriend: (Chatting) Fine babe.\n\nGirlfriend: Which \u2018fine babe\u2019 are you talking about?\n\nBoyfriend: I\u2019m referring to you, of course.\n\nGirlfriend: Then write \u2018Fine, babe\u2019 (which means you are fine), not \u2018Fine babe\u2019 (which means you are talking about another fine woman).\n\nBoyfriend: Nawa o. Sha let\u2019s eat madam. Let\u2019s eat at our favourite spot.\n\nGirlfriend: Which madam do you want to eat?\n\nBoyfriend: What is this na? I mean we should eat together.\n\nGirlfriend: Then, you should type \u2018Let\u2019s eat, madam.\u2019 The presence of the vocative comma indicates that you want \u2018madam\u2019 to eat with you, whereas its absence means that you actually want to eat \u2018madam\u2019.\n\nBoyfriend: This relationship cannot work.\n\nGo and eat your grammar\n\nMrs Bamgbose: That guy is too lousy for my liking.\n\nDr GAB: Maybe you mean noisy. To be lousy is to be poor or bad.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Mr Dr, you understand what I mean; he is a talkative.\n\nDr GAB: He is talkative or a talkative person. Adjectives aren\u2019t preceded by the indefinite articles \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018an\u2019 unless the adjectives are succeeded by nouns.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Please, don\u2019t give me headache, Mr Man. I am not a grammarian.\n\nDr GAB: A headache. Headache is a countable noun and should attract the article \u2018a\u2019.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Thank God it\u2019s Saturday morning. When you finish your correction, go and have grammar as breakfast.\n\nDr GAB: Madam, be calming down na.\n\nPolitics or grammar: playing with the prefix \u2018in\u2019\n\nGAB: I think General Sanni Abacha was infamous.\n\nFriend: How will you say someone who ruled Nigeria for five years was not popular?\n\nGAB: Well, an infamous person is actually popular, although s/he is known for bad deeds.\n\nFriend: Ehn ehn, okay o.\n\nGAB: But he was really invaluable in the lives of some persons.\n\nFriend: Of course! What value can come from such a leader?\n\nGAB: Well, to be invaluable is to be extremely useful or indispensable.\n\nFriend: Alaye, come. Are we discussing politics or you want to be using scope to teach me English?\n\nGAB: Well, just concentrate on the driving. The vehicle in front is inflammable.\n\nFriend: Ehn that means it cannot catch fire na.\n\nGAB: To be inflammable means to be flammable. What is inflammable can be easily set on fire.\n\nFriend: Even your corrections are inflammable. Stop this trouble so we can have a smooth ride.\n\nGAB: Okay!\n\nSomething is wrong with English\n\nFriend: This man is our sponsorer.\n\nGAB: Someone who sponsors anything is a sponsor; not a sponsorer.\n\nFriend: I\u2019m not in for your drama, GAB. Let me quickly join our sponsor where he wants to barb his hair.\n\nRead also: \u2018Zero eight zero\u2019 or \u2018Oh eight Oh\u2019: Demystifying the use of numbers in English\n\nGAB: Well, in this context, we have \u2018barber\u2019, not barb. When you trim or groom the hair or beards of people, you barber their hair or beards. So a barber barbers; s/he does not barb. Again, take note that since the sponsor is not a barber, the sponsor is supposed to have his hair barbered (or have his hair cut); the sponsor cannot barber his hair.\n\nFriend: So you removed the \u2018er\u2019 that we have always known in \u2018sponsorer\u2019, then you now added it to \u2018barb\u2019 which we have said for years, right? It is either something is wrong with you, or something is wrong with English.\n\nGAB: I guess something is wrong with English, dear friend.\n\nFriend: I think something is wrong with the two both of you.\n\nBreaking fast with grammar\n\nMrs Bamgbose: It\u2019s 7 p.m; would you have fruits first or you want to eat?\n\nDr GAB: In the general sense, we say fruit, not fruits.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Please, talk. I need to go and get some stuffs.\n\nDr GAB: Stuff, not stuffs.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Ogbeni, should I make the toast bread now or later?\n\nDr GAB: It\u2019s toast, not toast bread.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Well, you can take cold ice water in the fridge when you\u2019re ready.\n\nDr GAB: It\u2019s ice-cold water, not cold ice water.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: You are not ready to break your fast (walks away).\n\nDr GAB: Madam, come here.\n\nMrs Bamgbose: Commentary ni. Use grammar to break your fast.\n\nThe troublesome grammarian\n\nFriend: Thanks for offering your condolence as regards my dad\u2019s demise.\n\nGAB: You\u2019re welcome, but we offer condolences (not, condolence).\n\nFriend: The Christian faithfuls were present at the wake-keeping and the last rite.\n\nGAB: The Christian faithful (not, the Christian faithfuls) were present at the wake (not wake-keeping) and the last rites (not, rite).\n\nFriend: Oh, thanks! His remain was buried in the village.\n\nGAB: His remains (not, remain) were (not, was) buried in the village.\n\nFriend: Thanks! But wait o! Are you happy about my father\u2019s death?\n\nGAB: Ah no o! God forbid!\n\nFriend: So why do I have to go through this stress after losing my father? And what about your father?\n\nGAB: He\u2019s no more.\n\nFriend: Oh, no wonder!\n\nGrammar and interest\n\nLady: Am interested in you, GAB.\n\nGAB: I\u2019m interested in you.\n\nLady: Oh, am happy is mutual.\n\nGAB: It\u2019s not mutual. I was correcting your use of the contractions \u2018I\u2019m\u2019 (not, am) and \u2018it\u2019s\u2019 (not, is).\n\nLady: Have never thought you could act this way.\n\nGAB: Again, \u2018I have\u2019 is contracted as \u2018I\u2019ve\u2019, not have.\n\nYou should be interested in grammar for now. Would you mind if I gift you with a copy of my grammar textbook, \u2018Grammar in Discourse Form\u2019?\n\nLady: Okay o.",

          "text": "I met Rita Dominic before I met her. On the small and big screen. Rita reminded me a lot of Elizabeth Taylor. She idled your screen with power, presence and elegance. Very few actresses possess that gift. Her delivery in all the roles she played was always without a doubt phenomenal.\n\nShe was well spoken, a truly dedicated actress with a high dress sense, sense of self and skin clear as glass. Rita always left an impression, an impeccable one for that matter, whenever she appeared in a movie.\n\nThe next time I met Rita was when she arrived Malawi at the behest of an international TV network and the Malawian government hoisting the Nigerian flag.\n\nThe stadium where she was hosted could not contain her fans and that image of Rita hoisting the Nigerian flag remained etched in our memory forever.\n\nStay humble and beautiful. We are rooting for you. In all of this, remember both of you that mature love is mature. Your business is not for the internet. The wedding, yes. The marriage, No. That\u2019s between both of you\n\nIn an article in the Trust Newspapers earlier in the week, Professor Jibrin said he had arrived in Malawi at about the same time with Rita following his appointment as an observer in the Malawi election at the time.\n\nHe added that along with President Kuffour of Ghana, who led the group of observers, they went to see Rita at the stadium after a Malawian immigration officer got upset with him for not knowing Rita.\n\nEven though they ended up not seeing Rita, he considered her foray in Malawi and Nollywood in totality as a Nigerian brand project. I saw Rita as a true symbol of all things positive about Nigeria with that green-white-green flag as she stormed Malawi. Unforgettable!\n\nThen I eventually met her in person. Polite, soft-spoken, utterly respectful, Rita epitomised a truly beautiful star with no chips on her shoulders, I liked her instantly. She patiently took pictures with all her teeming fans. A sight for sore eyes.\n\nRead also: Why Brands Need Celebrity Advertising\n\nSo this symbol of all things Nigerian is who Fidelis Anosike got. A true national treasure is who Rita is. And when Anosike took her as a bride we were all invested \u2013 Nigerians at home and abroad. Malawian, Americans, West Indians. These are people who love Rita worldwide.\n\nSo, Mr Anosike you took our collective prize. Like Omotola Jalade Ekeinde pretty much said last week, \u201cwe are all shining our eyes. This is our marriage and we all handed Rita over to you. Treat her gently. Love her much. Understand like any person married to a public figure that people will stop and stare at your wife, that people will try to touch her, that some will even try to marry her off you.\u201d\n\nMarrying a celebrity is not easy. Be Ready. But I have met Rita and she is beautiful and humble. Deal with all of this well. You took our Rita but it\u2019s okay because you must now look after her on behalf of us all.\n\nRita, remember you are a role model to women over 30 who have hoped and waited. If it can happen to you this magical story, it can happen to them. Stay humble and beautiful. We are rooting for you. In all of this, remember both of you that mature love is mature. Your business is not for the internet. The wedding, yes. The marriage, No. That\u2019s between both of you.\n\nCongratulations to a stunning bride and groom who took the ultimate prize. Congratulations to Rita and Fidelis. Amid all the challenges in the country, a fairy tale wedding is what we needed. And we are here for it. It was a flat out gorgeous wedding.\n\nFrom Rita\u2019s beautiful wedding apparels to Fidelis\u201ds one in a million dance steps. Congratulations to you both!",

          "text": "Numerous studies have linked leadership behaviours with satisfaction. It suggests that a leader\u2019s use of a more participative management style will result in higher levels of satisfaction among their employees.\n\nIt is on this premise that this article analyses the antecedents of petty leadership and the effects of pettiness on subordinates, with emphasis on the management, social-psychological, social work, and political science works of literature have yielded a host of constructs akin to the notion of petty leadership.\n\nWhich causes low self-esteem, unfounded fear, anxiety, self-doubt and lack of assurance, abysmal performance, little work unit cohesiveness, and leader endorsement, and high frustration, stress, resentment, demotivation, loss of creativity and innovation, helplessness, and work alienation among subordinates. These effects may trigger a vicious circle that sustains petty behaviour.\n\nPettiness affects all members of the organisation, all the way from the customers/clients, peers, subordinates, superiors, management board, and the general interpersonal climate of the workplace\n\nSo, let us analyse the interactions of individual predispositions and situational facilitators that enhances petty behaviour by leaders in your organisation.\n\nPerhaps, the most intriguing issue is how each proposed antecedent is necessary or sufficient to prompt petty leadership. Each individual and situational factor can likely drive at least sporadic instances of pettiness. For example, a highly stressed manager snaps at a subordinate.\n\nThus, each antecedent is argued to constitute a primary effect. However, these main effects are likely to be relatively weak as the growing literature on interactionism suggests that no individual or situational factor alone is generally sufficient to sustain ongoing organisational behaviour, including petty behaviour.\n\nInstead, continued pettiness may be a function of specific configurations of individual and situational factors.\n\nThere are, potentially, many such configurations. However, three seem particularly likely to predict petty behaviour.\n\n\u2013 First, certain beliefs about the organisation and about subordinates may combine with the macro-level factor of institutionalised values and norms to provoke pettiness.\n\nManagers who subscribe to a bureaucratic orientation would accept these beliefs in organisations and departments that value compliance with centralised decisions and standardised tasks.\n\nThis acceptance may translate into a higher tolerance for pettiness or petty behaviour. Sadly, it may even legitimise and normalise such behaviour.\n\n\u2013 A second potential configuration involves beliefs about the self. Such beliefs perhaps compliment them about the organisation and subordinate\u2013and the micro-level factor of power.\n\nRead also: How to manage petty leaders in your organisation \u2013 3\n\nThe acquisition and successful use of power may enhance self-perceptions, legitimise one\u2019s position, and compensate for a perceived personal inability to influence others. However, behavioural experts posit that individuals differ in how they are psychologically constrained from exercising power in socially undesirable ways.\n\nIndividuals with low \u201cpower inhibition\u201d are more apt to act with pettiness. I would argue that self-esteem is one critical variable that affects this felt inhibition. Based on the social identity theory, individuals with high self-esteem may be better able to buffer their personal identity from their social identity as powerholders and thus maintain some psychological distance from the seductive qualities of the latter.\n\nAccordingly, consistent with research on human behaviour, individuals with low self-esteem are likely to find the seductive qualities of power particularly attractive and feel less constrained in their use of power. A typical example of a petty leader in this category is the one who defines himself mainly by his work.\n\n\u2013 A third potential configuration involves preferences for action and the micro-level factor of stressors. As noted, managers tend to respond to stressors by behaving more dictatorially. This tendency may be exacerbated by a predisposition to directiveness and a low tolerance for ambiguity.\n\nRegarding the former, individuals subject to stress tend to rely upon well-learned patterns of behaviour. To a certain extent, this particular pattern is functional and normatively expected during troubling times.\n\nRegarding the latter, the lower the tolerance for ambiguity, the more likely that a given stressor will be perceived as a threat, and thus, the more likely that one will respond in a controlling manner.\n\nThese three proposed configurations are only a subset of the many possibilities. Given the absence of research on the issue, such interactionist arguments are clearly speculative.\n\nSo, what are the effects of petty leadership on subordinates in any organisation?\n\nPettiness affects all members of the organisation, all the way from the customers/clients, peers, subordinates, superiors, management board, and the general interpersonal climate of the workplace. However, the following discussion of effects is restricted to subordinates because:\n\nThey are hierarchically dependent and are thus a frequent target of pettiness and petty behaviours; The extent to which petty leaders display different behaviours to less dependent members of the workplace is unclear.\n\nA review of the literature suggests five interdependent groups of effects of petty behaviour on subordinates: leader endorsement, frustration, stress, and reactance; Helplessness and work alienation; Self-esteem and performance, and Work unit cohesiveness.\n\nPlease lookout for a continuation of this article.",

          "title": "The first Emmanuel Adeyemo Elebute Memorial Lecture, and matters arising",
          "text": "On April 21, 2022, an event took place at the MUSON Centre, Lagos. It was the first memorial lecture held in honour of Professor Emmanuel Adeyemo Elebute, who died in 2019 at the age of 87 years.\n\nThe memorial lecture was originally scheduled for a date in 2020. However, the date turned out to fall on a time when COVID-19 was coming into its own, and much of the world was going into lockdown. The event was postponed.\n\nProfessor Elebute was a distinguished Professor of Surgery who scored many firsts in the Nigerian healthcare space. He was the first Provost of the College of Medicine, University of Lagos.\n\nHe was the first Chief Medical Director of Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idiaraba. He was the first, and only, person to hold both positions simultaneously.\n\nHer care and the communication with her family were mishandled at every step of her hospitalisation, and her tragic, and avoidable death, left a very sour taste in everyone\u2019s mouth. Nothing happened following the critical incident to give assurance it would not happen again\n\nHe was president of the Nigerian Postgraduate Medical College at a crucial time in the development of postgraduate medical education in Nigeria.\n\nAfter retirement from public service, he, with his wife, Professor (Mrs) Oyinade Elebute, founded the Hygiea Group. This grew into a Health Management Organisation and a Community Health Plan, which did ground-breaking work in grassroots healthcare in Kwara State and elsewhere.\n\nIt also spawned the Lagoon Hospitals, an entity that would become the first healthcare facility in sub-Saharan African to receive Quality Certification from Joint Commission International (JCI), the gold standard for Quality in the world-wide practice of Medicine.\n\nWith like-minded collaborators, Elebute set up the Society for Quality Health in Nigeria (SQHN), which was incorporated in 2006. The Society has since grown to a level where it is providing training on Quality Improvement to a wide swathe of facilities and health personnel across the nation.\n\nIt has received certification from ISQua \u2013 the international body responsible for Quality Accreditation world-wide, to conduct Accreditation of health facilities under its own brand, thus becoming only the second body in sub-Saharan Africa, after COHSASA (the Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa), to domesticate the international Accreditation function.\n\nThis represented the actualisation of a life-long ambition of Professor Elebute \u2013 to have Nigerian health facilities at all levels, from \u2018federal\u2019 Teaching Hospitals to the lowliest Primary Health Care Centre, work towards being assessed and Accredited domestically for Quality in a way that will bring them on a par with international standards.\n\nAs the event got off to a start, Fola Adeola, chairman of the occasion, got up to make his opening remarks. He started off by recounting the exact and precise rituals that aircraft pilots enact on the ground every time before taking an aircraft into the air. A long check-list of queries, meticulously gone through, item by item, and ticked off.\n\nAs he explained, once the aircraft is airborne, \u2018there are no bus stops.\u2019 He likened the need for meticulous, standardised and repeatable quality in healthcare to the situation in the pilot\u2019s cabin.\n\nHe spoke glowingly of his association with the late Professor Elebute.\n\n\u2018His white shirt was always white\u2019 he said, referring to the neatness of turn-out that was a part of the Elebute persona.\n\nFola Laoye, one of the children of the Professor, introduced the guest lecturer.\n\nProfessor Muhammad Ali Pate, is the Julio Frenk Professor of Public Health and Leadership in the Department of Global Health and Population at Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health, USA.\n\nHe is the co-chairman of the initiative on the Future of Health and Economic Resilience in Africa (FHERA). He was also the minister of state for health in the Federal Republic of Nigeria for some time.\n\nWhile in the latter office, he was credited with the first efforts to introduce Quality Improvement in Federal tertiary hospitals across the nation.\n\nHis topic was \u2018Reimagining the future of Healthcare in Africa \u2013 A Healthcare Quality Perspective.\u2019\n\nHe started off by paying fulsome tribute to Elebute, who he knew personally. He emphasised the crucial importance of Quality in Healthcare and commended the efforts of the Society for Quality Healthcare in Nigeria in carrying forward Elebute\u2019s vision.\n\nRead also: Partnerships in health financing: A reliable pathway to strengthening diagnostics in Africa\n\nHe recalled an incident that caused the death of a patient in one of the Federal Medical Centres in the northern part of the country when he was minister.\n\nThe matter was in the news, and he decided to pay an unscheduled visit to the Centre. Once there, he demanded to see records of the incident. It was clear that the hospital documents had been altered.\n\nWhen he took steps to dig deeper, he began to hear ominous rumblings from the workers\u2019 Unions, accusing him of not following \u2018due process.\u2019 Eventually, the matter died. There was simply no evidence to work with.\n\nHe described another widely reported incident involving the death of a woman in a tertiary facility in Lagos. Her care and the communication with her family were mishandled at every step of her hospitalisation, and her tragic, and avoidable death, left a very sour taste in everyone\u2019s mouth. Nothing happened following the critical incident to give assurance it would not happen again.\n\nHe homed in on his key deliverable. Everyone, from politicians to journalists, was talking nowadays about the need to achieve Universal Healthcare Access for all citizens. He wanted to add a caveat.\n\n\u2018Healthcare Access without Quality is dangerous.\u2019\n\nLecturer and honoree had coalesced around the point Elebute spent his final years trying to make. Quality was the crucial ingredient required to take the healthcare of Nigerians, high and low, to the next level. Universal Access, riding on the back of measured, standardised Quality at every level, was the entitlement of every Nigerian citizen.\n\nSitting next to Fola, the chairman, on the front-row provided you with an opportunity to hear about his latest, colossal venture into healthcare finance. As usual he was economical with words, but you heard enough to catch a whiff of increasing enthusiasm for private sector participation in the business of healthcare in Nigeria.\n\nYou shook hands with Dr Pate.\n\nIt was time to leave.",

          "text": "The rupture in the relationship between President Muhammadu Buhari and Bola Tinubu has finally happened. Now, we can predict with reasonable certainty that Buhari does not fancy Tinubu as the presidential flag bearer of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nFor upwards of seven years, these two have been forced into an alliance dictated by their mutual interests. It was rumoured that there was an agreement by the duo to take turns at the presidency.\n\nMr Tinubu kept his own side of the bargain by sticking with Buhari through thick and thin. In 2014, his support was critical to Mr Buhari picking the presidential ticket of the APC. Even more daunting, Tinubu ensured Buhari\u2019s victory at the polls in the entirety of the Southwest.\n\nMr Tinubu is not unaware of these realities. There are credible rumours he\u2019s already propping a political party that has adopted the name of a hitherto winning political party to serve as his fall-back option in the event he is denied the APC ticket\n\nIn 2019, even in the face of poor performance and nothing to show for his four-year leadership, Tinubu still supported him, resorting to ethnic politics and voter intimidation to deliver Lagos and some southwestern states to Buhari.\n\nEven in October 2020, when Mr Buhari sent in troops to massacre innocent youth protesting police brutality at the Lekki toll gates, Tinubu stood behind him at the risk of losing his grip on the voting population of Lagos. Instead of speaking against the killings, Mr Tinubu upbraided the youth and asked them what they were doing at the toll gate at the time.\n\nHowever, when it was time for Mr Buhari to repay the favour to Tinubu, he has become non-committal and appears to be backing other candidate(s) for the position. Long before the election season, there were rumours that Mr Buhari\u2019s close circle are not enamoured by Tinubu and wanted another candidate to fly the party ticket at the election. That was why Tinubu pre-empted them all and declared his intention first with the hope that his declaration may weaken the resolve of some of his opponents within the party and force the hand of the President.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t worked out as planned. Many other contestants also close to President Buhari have since declared their intentions to contest for the party\u2019s ticket. More jarring was the declaration of the Vice President, Tinubu\u2019s political godson. It was said Osinbajo sought and got the permission of the President to throw his hat into the ring. Media reports also suggest a former president, Goodluck Jonathan, is under immense pressure from Mr. Buhari\u2019s circle to join the race.\n\nRead also: Presidency: Osinbajo, Tinubu in fight to the finish\n\nAlthough Jonathan has said he will only join the race on the condition that he is endorsed and supported wholeheartedly by Mr Buhari, a tweet by Jonathan\u2019s former spokesperson that Jonathan is on the verge of joining the presidential race on the platform of the ruling APC has further complicated matters and left analysts guessing as to who exactly will get the president\u2019s endorsement for the polls.\n\nAll these have left Tinubu feeling used and betrayed. And for the first time in seven years, he has publicly disassociated himself from the President and offered his first open rebuke and criticism of the Buhari administration.\n\nSpeaking a fortnight ago at a youth rally, he chided the Buhari administration for failing to tackle the urgent challenges of the country, offering himself as a better alternative. \u201cWe feel your anger when you are angry. I don\u2019t blame you. The promises of the past have failed to realise,\u201d he told an enthusiastic crowd of youth in Lagos who gathered to support his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue with excuses or NEPA failure. No. No nation can make rapid development without electricity. Give us that and if we cannot be successful, then you can abuse us. But you cannot give us erratic electricity that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy,\u201d Mr. Tinubu told his cheering supporters.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBarely a week after the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Andrew Adaze Emwanta was presented with an Award by his Alma Mata, Annunciation Catholic College, Irrua, ACC, the Law students Government of Benson Idahosa University, LAWSA have presented a congratulatory card to him for his well deserved appointment.\n\nThe President of Benson Idahosa University Law student association, Ansa Joshua who led other members of the executive to the office of the Commissioner in Benin City, said they have come to congratulate him for the appointment which was earned due to his dedication and pragmatic approach to duty.\n\n\u201cWhile we were sworn-in, the faculty informed us that an erstwhile President of the Association was sworn in as a Commissioner in Edo state. We were told of your great works in the faculty which includes the accreditation of the faculty during your tenure.\n\n\u201cWe deem it fit and proper to visit you even though belated and to acquaint you of our activities during our law week and to request that our erstwhile President who is the Commissioner of Communication and Orientation embrace this event as the chairman.\n\nAccording to him, the law week is expected to commence from June 13 to June 17 2022 with inter chamber competitions, other competitions, election, grand dinner and lecture which will be on constitutional law taking into consideration the fact that the 2023 elections is drawing near.\n\nThe Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon Andrew Adaze Emwanta Esq. in his response said it was a thing of joy to host the LAWSA Government of Benson Idahosa University because it brings back nostalgic feelings\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was in this manner we visited dignitaries in and out of government soliciting their support during our law week and for me I have always participated in LAWSA activities from the time I got into BIU.\n\n\u201cI was so committed that little did I know I will become President of LAWSA. We started off as Pioneers and we did not have a constitution which was our first task. When I came in I felt for us to have a system there must be a legal basis for that system to operate.\n\n\u201cThe good thing was that I came in as a direct entry student and there was need to put into work our constitutional knowledge as student of constitutional law. When the time came for election I first indicated interest to run as Vice President.\n\n\u201cI actually won the election but it was rigged because they saw some of us coming in as people who believe in change. We felt Law students should be trained in a manner that they should be able to separate the law and religion.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in, we did not have a good court, a statue of Justice and we fought that there must be a symbol of what the law faculty should be and we were able to garner funds through community development to provide us with that statue of Justice at the time.\n\n\u201cThose were some of the things we did when we were there and eventually I ran for the office of LAWSA President and I won. Before I came on board we had just one democratically elected president and when I came on board I was the second person elected and there after I was elected as the National President of LAWSA for all Private Universities.\n\nHe noted that he would not be sitting as a Commissioner today if he was not a student of BIU because according to him BIU taught him how to see himself as a future leader and the institution also created that professional environment.\n\nIn his words, \u201cthat created a system of playing politics. Even while in LAWSA we were also involve in the National Association of Nigeria Students activities and at some point I was made the liaison Director of zone two.\n\n\u201cIt afforded me the opportunity of mixing with people and that is what I should encourage all of you, try as much as possible to mix with those in other Universities. There are so many benefits you get when you do not limit yourself.\n\n\u201cAs a former LAWSA President, the moment you invite me for an event I am under obligation to attend and that obligation extends to my colleagues who are lawyers. I will assist you in any way you want me to.\u201d\n\nWhile admonishing the law students to take their academics seriously, Hon Emwanta maintained that during his days at BIU, reading was a culture and he took the students down memory lane how he became a Commissioner.\n\n\u201cAs a lecturer at the University of Calabar for over a decade, at some point I said to myself that leadership runs in my vein and I cannot achieve that through lecturing, how can I give back to my state. I had to come back to Edo State.\n\n\u201cFortunately for me I did not go through any godfather, the governor saw competence in me. I made that commitment to represent what is good, what is right and what is just and the Edo 2020 governorship election, you will agree with me was a just cause and it was because I believed in that just cause that I was so rewarded.\n\nAccording to him, none of them cannot achieve what he has achieved but what is required is commitment, first to their academics because nobody just occupy an office from nowhere, there must first be competence.\n\n\u201cThen secondly, the law students must work towards achieving any set target. Any one of you can become the governor of your state, but you must start somewhere, by setting that trajectory,\u201d the Commissioner added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "2023: Why I\u2019m no longer interested in Nigeria\u2019s politics \u2013 Elliot Uko",
          "text": "Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA) has said he is not interested in Nigeria\u2019s politics of 2023, because another election is not the solution to the country\u2019s problems.\n\nEvangelist Uko in a statement made available to our correspondents on Thursday, maintained that without restructuring, those hoping for a better Nigeria are on a wild goose chase.\n\nUko who also commented on the presidential aspirations of Nyesom Wike, Rivers State governor, accused the governor of playing the role of a spoiler, while also berating Goodluck Jonathan, the country\u2019s former president for, according to him, being greedy for power.\n\nJonathan is rumoured to be nursing presidential ambition under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cA lot of people are asking me why I remain aloof and unconcerned at this time. I am a little bit suprised folks can\u2019t read the thermometer correctly,\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cThere are only three groups active in my region today:\n\nA: The politicos grining from ear to ear in excitement as they attempt to access power either as President, Vice-president, Governor or retire into the Senate. They are very busy today. They and their hangers-on, acolytes, supporters and followers have taken over the mainstream and social media screaming to high heaven, with cash exchanging hands.\n\nB: The young folks agitating loudly for years; who still believe in their agitation, but who seem to have finally split themselves into factions and who now prefer to silently accept that the tempo of their agitation have now been defined by same politicos they had earlier looked unto with suspicion.\n\nC: The ambivalent populace who look upto the next election as an elixir. They believe tomorrow will be better. They believe the elections ten months away will usher in positive change.\u201d\n\nAccording to Uko, \u201cthe excitement and optimism they exhude for a better tomorrow raises hope that the land will experience better days. That\u2019s great.\n\n\u201cI am quiet because I don\u2019t belong to any of the above listed blocks. If the public must know, I have been quite busy writing certain groups, parties and individuals.\n\n\u201cI wrote all serious contenders for the Presidency across party lines, Party leadership across-the-board and prominent leaders in the land.\n\n\u201cMy message was simple. I pleaded thus: That if the two big parties do not zone their presidential ticket to the South East, as done to the South West in 1999, then there\u2019s really no sincerity in granting the South East the opportunity to lead Nigeria for a season.\n\n\u201cAny person, cabal accessing power come 2023, who does not understand that the most important business of the day would be urgent revert to power devolution and resource control, would be deceiving himself, as true federalism remain the ONLY panacea to salvaging Nigeria.\n\n\u201cReconstructing the polity is imperative for Nigeria\u2019s survival, unity and progress. Abusing, attacking, threatening and insulting other contestants will not help our cause.\n\n\u201cI received favourably responses and believe my message was well taken. I am not excited about partisan campaigns and sloganeering. I\u2019m not interested in accommodation within the system nor access to power and patronage.\n\n\u201cForty-three years ago, in 1979, I witnessed the largest human crowd I\u2019d ever seen as a teenager when the great Zik launched the NPP presidential campaign at Ngwo Park, Bede Wright, Uwani Enugu. I was marched on and almost passed out. My friends snd classmates Francis Oburu and Charles Achara resuscitated me at the home of another friend and classmate Joe Anunwa, who lived right beside Ngwo Park. The sea of heads frightened me. The legendary Zik, I assumed would win easily.\n\n\u201cTwenty years later, in 1999, Dr Pius Okigbo sent me to Boyle Street office of ALEPCO to mobilise youth groups in partnership with Prof Ben Obumselu at the Alex Ekwueme Presidential campaign office, at Sunny Odogwu\u2019s imposing building at Lagos island. There was free transport to the Jos party congress and the frenzy and euphoria was high. There was no better candidate than Dr Alex Ekwueme, it seemed.\n\n\u201cSix years earlier, Chief Ewelle of Easygoing Hotel Ipodo, Ikeja, took me to the HOPE 93 Campaign office of MKO Abiola to meet Dr Jonathan Zwingina at the Opebi by Allen office of the Abiola campaign office. Youth groups under me were addressed by Chief Abiola.\n\n\u201cI never witnessed a greater campaign than that of HOPE 93. The candidate prepared for decades. Courted traditional rulers, clerics, elder statesmen and sponsored the wedding of hundreds of journalists. Mobilised the North, West, East and everywhere. He seemed unstoppable.\n\n\u201cI have seen quite a bit in my sixty years here. My plea and position remain unchanged.\n\n\u201cThe need to reconstruct Nigeria supersedes the political ambition of any individual.\n\n\u201cFinally, I am disappointed with Governor Wike for playing the spoiler. I am greatly embarrassed by the greed for power, and self entered thoughtlessness of ex President Jonathan, who is willing to crush the South East dream after all we did for him. Sad.\n\n\u201cThose who expect me to join the dance and sloganeering, should give me a break. The politicos should enjoy their season. But they should also try and get it right for once. I wish them luck.\u201d",

          "text": "The government of Bayelsa State has distanced itself from the views shared by Daniel Alabrah, Governor Douye Diri\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, in an article of former president, Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s alleged presidential bid.\n\nAlabrah, had in the said article opposed the alleged presidential bid by Jonathan, noting that it would shortchange the entire southern Nigeria.\n\nJonathan who completed his first term as president of Nigeria in 2015, would only hold office for an additional one term if elected president.\n\nAlabrah said in the online article, \u201cMy personal view is that another Goodluck Jonathan presidency will shortchange the whole southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe can constitutionally run for only one term of four years. After a northerner, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s eight years, the south would spite its face presenting a president than can only do one term. For me, it is a No-No.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s media further said, \u201cOn another front, Jonathan running on the APC ticket is totally unacceptable to me. After being president on the PDP platform for five years, joining the APC solely for the purpose of becoming President gives him away as being overly desperate. It rubbishes the tag on him as being a democrat.\n\n\u201cIf he is still interested to return to the Aso Villa, why dump the PDP? Accepting to join APC because of the lure of the presidential ticket is like swallowing the poisoned chalice. And I\u2019ll be too happy to see him lose if he contests. It doesn\u2019t matter to me whether he is our respected leader from Bayelsa. My candid personal opinion.\u201d\n\nDistancing itself from the media aide\u2019s remarks in a statement issued by the Commissioner for Information, Orientation and Strategy, Ayibaina Duba, in Yenagoa on Thursday, the state government said the clarification became necessary because, despite the fact that Alabrah clearly stated that the views he articulated were personal, many had mistaken his personal opinion for that of Diri and his administration because of Alabrah\u2019s position as the CPS to the governor.\n\nThe government insisted that they were Alabrah\u2019s personal views and did not in any way represent the position of his principal, the governor, or the government.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cFor the records, the views expressed by Mr. Daniel Alabrah were his private views and do not represent the position of the Governor or the Bayelsa State Government.\n\n\u201cGovernment hereby disassociate completely with the views expressed by Mr. Daniel Alabrah. His views are not, cannot, and should not be attributed to the Governor and the Government of Bayelsa State.\n\n\u201cIt must be stated here that Governor Douye Diri respects and holds the person and the position of the former president, His Excellency, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan in high regard.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should therefore disregard any unfounded attribution of the CPS\u2019s unflattering personal views on the subject matter to the Governor and or the Government of Bayelsa State.\n\n\u201cGovernment further wishes to use this medium to warn appointees of the administration to be conscious of their position and appreciate that their opinion can easily be misconstrued for those of Government. They are advised to exercise restraint and good judgment in their public discourse.\n\n\u201cGovernment will not hesitate to take drastic action against any appointee who throws caution into the wind, fails to respect his office, and conduct himself in a manner that may put the Governor in disrepute, undermine the good image of the Bayelsa State Government or cause disaffection among stakeholders in the state.\u201d",

Typical of election years all over the world, the tempo of political activities is often high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018That\u2019s the nature of democracy. I\u2019m committed to bequeathing a stronger culture of credible elections to Nigeria than I met.\n\n\u2018\u2018As Nigeria goes through this trajectory, I urge our friends in the global community, represented by you the Diplomatic Corps, to adopt a positive role that reinforces the doctrine of respect for our internal affairs and respect for facts and devoid of pre-conceived notions and bias.\u201d\n\nBuhari vowed to use every legitimate means to protect Nigerians\u2019 votes during the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to him, those planning to rig the elections should think twice \u201cbecause I intend to resolutely protect and defend the sacred will of the Nigerian people, to be expressed through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nOn the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Buhari called for greater consideration for humanitarian conditions in the affected areas.\n\nHe warned that the conflict would get worse if an immediate resolution was not found.\n\nHe welcomed the recent initiative of UN Secretary-General, Antonio Gutteres, of visiting Moscow and Kyiv, commending his efforts in search of a ceasefire, as a prelude to other enduring solutions.\n\nHe urged the world, especially the Muslim community, to use the solemn and rewarding month of Ramadan, and especially these last days of the fast, to intensify prayers for de-escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and for the return of peace to the world.\n\nOn COVID-19, Buhari restated Nigeria\u2019s demand for vaccine equity and waiver of patents for manufacturing vaccines and approved drugs to treat the highly infectious disease.\n\nHe said the country would continue to expand its capacities for managing the pandemic.\n\nOn regional security, he told the diplomats that the impact of the Libyan crisis on the countries in the Sahel, Lake Chad Basin, West and Central Africa was still enormous and catastrophic.\n\nHe expressed concern on the free circulation of small and light arms in these regions, made worse by the uncontrolled expulsion of foreign fighters from Libya without adequate consultations with the countries of the region.\n\nOn the fight against Boko Haram, Buhari said, \u2018\u2018As you know well, Nigeria has made significant progress in combating the Boko Haram group in the North East.\n\n\u2018\u2018We\u2019re, however, recently confronted with new tactics deployed by the enemy to threaten our democratic values as well as the common peace and freedom we enjoy in this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari, according Daily Trust, expressed confidence that the security situation would soon be brought under control.\n\nHe acknowledged the support of Nigeria\u2019s friends and partners in the global community, particularly the European Union and the United States, \u2018\u2018for their understanding, support and agreement to allow us to procure vital equipment and resources to successfully propagate this war.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and High Commissioner of Cameroon to Nigeria, Ibrahima Salaheddine, said the international community would continue to support Nigeria before, during and after the 2023 general elections.",

We are alive because we work and only the dead is incapable of working.\u201d\n\nOgbeni Aregbesola further enjoined workers to imbibe the culture of productivity, saying: \u201cThe end of work is productivity. It is productivity that leads to satisfactory provision of goods and services and wealth creation. It is therefore the path to national and individual prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe urged workers to raise the bar of their trade in line with the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration\u2019s drive to rev up the vehicle of governance and make all the people of Nigeria derive maximum benefit from the nation.\n\nIn the same vein, the federal government through the minister also congratulated all Muslims for their successful completion of the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nAregbesola called on all Muslims to imbibe and practice the virtues of kindness, love, tolerance, peace, self-denial, sacrifice and good neighbourliness, as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe self-restrain, self-denial, sacrifice and deep spiritual consciousness that accompanied the fasting period should not end but be maintained and improved upon, in order to be a better person and true worshipper,\u201d the minister advised all Muslims.\n\nHe expressed confidence that the security challenges in some parts of the country will soon be a thing of the past, noting that the government was putting determined efforts and all necessary measures in place for Nigerians to enjoy unfettered peace all round.\n\nOgbeni Aregbesola gave the assurance that the administration of President Buhari was fully committed to securing lives and property of every citizen and foreigners alike.\n\nThe minister commended all security agencies for the successes so far recorded in the fight against criminality across the country, as well as the peace that has returned to the formerly embattled places.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to be part of the nation\u2019s security architecture by being vigilant and reporting suspicious individuals and activities to law enforcement agencies nearest to them, noting that security is everybody\u2019s responsibility.\n\nAregbesola wished all Muslims a happy Eid-ul-Fitr celebration and prayed that the peace, blessings and favours of Allah be with all.",

I have been a direct beneficiary of his leadership. I have been part of his cabinet\n\n\u201cPersonally I continue to tow that line of leadership and what he stands for.\n\n\u201cI want to say to you that you\u2019re eminently qualified and I want to wish you well in this journey.

And you come from that family of our leader.\n\n\u201cWe know that our leader is eminently qualified to rule this country. He has led Lagos state.\u201d\n\nRecall that on April 9, 2022, Amaechi, in a dramatic manner declared his intention to run for the office of president, describing his decision as a \u201cmoral duty to give what I can in the service of my country\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Tinubu, who has not officially declared his intention to vie for the exalted office of President of Nigeria had few months ago informed the incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari of his presidential ambition in 2023 general polls.",

          "text": "Ahead of next year\u2019s general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described himself as the most qualified of all the 17 aspirants vying for the 2023 presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe also told the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) that he deserved the right of first refusal, given his experience and competence.\n\nBut the NWC replied it would work for all the seventeen aspirants and not him alone, urging the former VP and others in the race to sell themselves to the delegates.\n\nA similar response was given to Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike who asked the NWC to pay him for his support and role in ensuring their emergence, and also provide level playing field for all aspirants.\n\nAnd in his response, the PDP national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, told the governor to settle for either of the two options, saying he cannot have the two all to himself alone.\n\nThe aspirants\n\nApart from Atiku and Wike, the rest presidential aspirants seeking the party\u2019s ticket at the National Convention slated for 28 and 29 May are: former Senate President Bukola Saraki; former Anambra Governor Peter Obi and Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nAlso included are former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Anyim Pius Anyim; Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed and Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel.\n\nOthers are renowned industrialist, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa; Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; a United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Ovation Magazine publisher, Dele Momodu, former Ekiti state Governor Ayo Fayose; Cosmos Ndukwe, Mr Charles Ugwu, Chikwendu Kalu and Tariele Diana Oliver.\n\nAtiku visits NWC\n\nSpeaking Thursday during his visit to the National Working Committee (NWC) members of the party in Abuja, the 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP also said with the 11 million votes he garnered in the last election, he deserved the right of first refusal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you what I am, what qualifications I have, what experience I have, and what I can do for this party, for this country,\u201d he told the party leaders.\n\nThe Waziri Adamawa pledged that if elected, he would reunite the country, deal decisively with security issues and revamp the economy.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman and members of the National Working Committee, I\u2019m really not here to lecture you, I\u2019m just really here to inform you of my decision to run again, and also to urge you to provide the right kind of leadership so that the best candidate can emerge.\n\n\u201cAnd I dare say Mr Chairman, I am the best candidate. Under normal circumstances Mr Chairman, this is a guy who has already 11 million votes in his kitty. And I think, as a party, you should give me the right of first refusal but we are in a democracy.\n\n\u201cAll I can urge you is to make sure that the way you have started, you also conclude the way you have started by being very fair, very credible, giving every contestant the opportunity to face the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the performance of the incumbent administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by President Muhammadu Buhari, Atiku said, \u201cevery Nigeria knows that the APC has failed but we should not take Nigerians for granted.\n\n\u201cWe should go all out to let them know APC has failed, it will continue to fail. No matter what gap they have come or they appear to be, they will continue to fail and PDP has not failed on your comparative analysis. If you compare the achievements of PDP and the failure of APC, you know that you have no other choice than PDP,\u201d he stated.\n\nAyu\n\nIn his reaction, the PDP national chairman, Senator Ayu, said he won\u2019t work for Atiku alone, but all the 17 aspirants.\n\n\u201cMr Vice President, I will not work for you as an aspirant. I will work for all the 17 aspirants. It is left to you to convince the delegates of our party that you are the best. You have to market yourself, you have to work hard,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nAyu, who assured that the NWC would not take side with any particular aspirant, urged all aspirants to convince the delegates and market themselves.\n\nThe PDP boss said: \u201cLet me take time to explain to Nigerians that the party has its internal mechanisms of selecting a candidate, whether by consensus or by-election, we will do it transparently.\n\n\u201cThose who love our party more than us should please tarry a little, they should not select candidates for the People\u2019s Democratic Party. They don\u2019t have our mandate and we will not concede that mandate to anybody, young or an elder who chooses by himself to choose a candidate for us.\n\n\u201cOur internal processes will go ahead and we are going ahead with it. At the end of the day, we\u2019ll come up with a candidate chosen by the members of the People\u2019s Democratic Party themselves. It is that candidate that will present to the rest of Nigeria for the forthcoming elections\u201d.\n\nScreening\n\nMeanwhile, there is palpable tension over the screening of the 17 PDP presidential aspirants as the David Mark-led committee meets today (Friday) to evaluate the contestants.\n\nAccording to the schedule of activities released by the National Organising Secretary, Hon. Umar Bature, the national convention is slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nThe screening exercise holds at Legacy House, Abuja, the party\u2019s presidential campaign headquarters.\n\nBlueprint reports that PDP Deputy National Publicity Secretary Ibrahim Abdullahi, who stood in for the national chairman at a function in Abuja recently, had hinted that the party would throw its 2023 presidential ticket open.\n\nHe had said: \u201cWell, for the opportunity that are available, and to provide equal opportunity for Nigerians to bid for the available political offices, those who are interested in pursuing for the presidency, we are opening it for every Nigerians to pursue. What it implies as we speak, every Nigerian is bidding from the south-east, from the south-west, and from the north, no section of Nigeria is denied an opportunity to contest or aspire.\u201d\n\nAnd further to this, the party\u2019s national chairman, last month, said the PDP has a history of rotating offices among various components making up Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, PDP has a history of rotating our offices. Anybody who doesn\u2019t get it this time should wait after the tenure of whoever will be our next President,\u201d Ayu had said.\n\nOrtom committee\n\nConsequently, the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) swiftly inaugurated a 37- man zoning committee led by Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom on the 24th of March, 2022.\n\nThe committee was to recommend to the party whether zoning would help it return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and that which part of the country to zone the presidency to.\n\nAfter 3 consecutive meetings and upon submitting its report 2 weeks ago, controversy continues to trail the committee\u2019s recommendation that the committee recommended that the 2023 ticket be thrown open.\n\nBut Governor Ortom debunked the report, saying their position would be made known by the party\u2019s NEC which gave them the assignment.\n\nConsensus\n\nAnd in their separate but collective efforts, the quartet of Tambuwal, Bala, Saraki and Hayatu-Deen, had traversed the length and breadth of the country championing the consensus arrangement.\n\nHowever, the arrangement collapsed when the duo of Bala and Saraki from the north-east and north-central respectively, were announced by a committee of northern leaders as presidential aspirants within the party.\n\nAs this continues to generate acrimony among the 4 aspirants and other aspirants from the north, many stakeholders have expressed fear that the party\u2019s position on zoning could negatively impact its performance in the general elections.\n\nTension\n\nThe struggle for the ticket is generating tension among party stakeholders, some of whom warned that zoning it to the North would be an injustice against the South and that this would come with some consequences.\n\nAlso, others cautioned that zoning the presidency to the South cannot help the party bounce back to its winning ways in 2023.\n\nPolitical pundits observed that tension is high in the party because whatever decision the party took can make or mar its chances in the forthcoming 2023 election.\n\nOthers also warned that if not well managed, it might lead to an implosion within the PDP.\n\nThe duo of Anyim and former PDP Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, had warned that any attempt to jettison the zoning arrangement would affect the party\u2019s chances in 2023.\n\nWhile Saraki insisted that it\u2019s the turn of the North Central to produce the next president, Tambuwal said zoning to the South won\u2019t guarantee the PDP victory in the election.\n\nWe\u2018re up to the task \u2013 Ologunagba\n\nIn an interview with Blueprint, PDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba dismissed the view that zoning and the contest for the party\u2019s ticket by the 17 aspirants may drag the party into an internal crisis.\n\nOn the party\u2019s position on zoning, he said, the party would make this known at the right time.\n\nThe PDP publicity scribe also assured that the national convention and congresses to elect the party\u2019s candidates for all positions would be free, fair, credible and transparent.\n\nHe said:\u201dPeople are in a hurry and concerned about our party\u2019s position on zoning because the PDP is the hope of Nigerians, the PDP will rescue and rebuild the country. Our position on zoning will be made known through the NEC at the right time.\n\n\u201cThe number of aspirants won\u2019t lead the party into any internal crisis during or even after the national convention. In any case, the PDP has an internal conflict resolution mechanism capable of resolving any issue.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we will ensure the party\u2019s national convention and even congress at all levels to elect party\u2019s candidate for all position is free, fair and credible.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026Gross profit hits N48.8bn, rising by 122.3%\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and the London Stock Exchange, announces its unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7bn from N10.6bn year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4bn from N1.7bn year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6bn from N57.9bn year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8bn from N20.1bn year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nIn its operations, Seplat Energy demonstrated a strong safety record, which extended to 26.1 million hours without LTI from operated assets (2.0 million hours in Q1 2022).\n\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis. The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\n\n\u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote has said on Wednesday that women entrepreneurs in the Nigerian oil and gas industry should break barriers by taking advantage of the $40m fund created specifically for them under the Nigerian Content Intervention Fund, NCI Fund.\n\nWabote spoke at the annual general meeting of the Oil and Gas Trainers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, OGTAN, held in Abuja with the theme \u201cDiversity & Inclusiveness in Human Capital development for the Energy Sector.\u201d\n\nNoting that that unavailability of funds was one of the key challenges that often hinder the participation of women in the oil and gas activities, the Executive Secretary stated that the Board had addressed the issue through the NCI Fund.\n\n\u201cTo provide a fair chance for women in the oil and gas industry, the Board partnered with the NEXIM Bank to establish a $20 million fund that was matched with an additional $20 million fund by NEXIM bank, making the total pool of funds available to women in oil and gas to be $40 million,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the Board and its partners have introduced and implemented several initiatives that promote diversity in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSome of those gender-focused interventions were being implemented in partnership with the Bank of Industry, BoI, while others were facilitated by the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, he added.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary, another step taken by the Board to drive diversity in oil and gas activities was the setting up of the Diversity Sectorial Group in the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Board has also organized events that were targeted at women and community activities to promote inclusiveness.\n\nHe mentioned that NCDMB\u2019s efforts to lead the womenfolk into the mainstream of the Nigerian oil and gas industry was recognized at the 5th Nigerian International Energy Summit this year when the agency was bestowed with an award of the \u201cBest Gender Support Company in the Energy Space\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Human Capacity Development, the NCDMB boss explained that it adds significant value to the energy sector, and contributes to developing local content in the energy sector.\n\nHe also confirmed that the Board\u2019s Human Capacity Development model has no gender bias as it was inclusive and provides equal opportunities to all applicants and beneficiaries.\n\nHe hinted that NCDMB had put in place the 60-20-20 training model in which 60 percent of the training resources provided by the Board and the industry are devoted to providing young Nigerians with specialized skills they need to secure employment.\n\nHe stated that \u201cunder this component of the model, beneficiaries are provided with qualitative skills and international certifications that will position them for employment within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also informed that 20 percent of the training spend was geared towards improvement in the productivity of already employed personnel while another 20 percent of spend on training is used for trainings on soft skills.\n\nThe Executive Secretary assured that the Board will continue to develop female members of staff to occupy key positions in preparation for higher leadership roles as well as continue to promote Human Capacity Development across various spheres of the energy sector, including skill development and entrepreneurship programs and STEM development across secondary and tertiary institutions to prepare youths for the future.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja in Appeal No. CA/ABJ/CV/269/2022 in the case between the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) vs Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim has ruled that all proceedings including the contempt proceedings initiated by Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and co at the trial court should be stayed pending the hearing, and determination of the substantive appeal.\n\nThe application for stay was argued on behalf of AMCON by their defence counsel A.U. Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings order, which he obtained under questionable circumstances.\n\nRecall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation owe the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried all reasonable and peaceful resolution strategies to recover the debt from Jimoh Ibrahim to no avail.\n\nAs a responsible debt recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, AMCON approached the Federal High Court (FHC) in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 to seek justice, and accordingly received an order of the trial court to take over the businesses of Jimoh Ibrahim. AMCON further received the backing of the trial court to appoint a Receiver/Manager to oversee the businesses on behalf of AMCON.\n\nFollowing the trial court\u2019s ruling, Jimoh Ibrahim, claimed that he was directed by the court on March 9, 2022, to commence contempt proceedings against the Executive Management of AMCON, which led AMCON to challenge the said ruling by filling Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeal on March 14, 2022.\n\nThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the outstanding N69.4billion debt owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.",

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nNigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has commenced the process of conducting a study to assess the current level of competition in the colocation and infrastructure sharing, CIS, segment of the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\nAccording to NCC, seventy-eight licensees are currently operating in that market segment.\n\nThe study is to enable the Commission to have insightful and evidenced-based facts to glean the dynamics at play and ensure the continuous growth of the CIS segment of the telecom market.\n\nThe NCC takes this issue as priority in view of the critical role played by the colocation and infrastructure sharing segment of the telecom ecosystem in ensuring robust services.\n\nAlready, the Commission has engaged the services of Messrs. Price Waterhouse Cooper, PwC, one of the world\u2019s reputable consulting firms, to conduct the study on its behalf, in exercise of NCC\u2019s regulatory functions as provided in the Nigerian Communications Act, NCA, 2003. The study is expected to be concluded between April and July, 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the NCC\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 forum recently organised in Lagos on the commencement of the study, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economy Analysis, PCEA, at NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, who represented the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the forum was hosted to intimate operators in the CIS segment of the telecom market on the study and to secure their buy-in and cooperation with the consultants undertaking the study.\n\nAkinloye reasoned that, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services, the NCC periodically conducts studies to assess the level of competition in the industry.\n\n\u201cHaving successfully conducted competition assessment studies in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the Commission had issued determinations based on the findings of the studies while outcome of such studies has also enabled the Commission to come up with various regulatory interventions and initiatives to continuously provide a level-playing field for the interplay of market forces. These procedures are emplaced by the Commission to ensure fair, efficient and sustainable competition in the Nigerian telecom industry.\u201d\n\nDespite the measurable progress made by the Commission, Akinloye stated that, since the successful completion of the 2013 study, there had been significant development and activities in some market segments of the industry that had necessitated the conduct of another competition study.\n\nFor instance, at the time the 2013 study was conducted, the CIS market segment was still at embryonic stage and as such, much emphasis was not placed on it. However, \u201cThe CIS segment has recorded significant growth and transformation over the years having about 80 licensees, operating in the segment while its performance and activities continue to impact significantly on other segments of the Nigerian industry. The Director PCEA also informed that activities in the CIS market have also attained the targets set out in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025)\u201d.\n\nAkinloye further declared that the overarching objective of the study is to provide current insights into the level of competition in the CIS market segment and articulate strategies to enhance opportunities in the market, as well as ensure the deepening of competition which will ultimately support the provision of innovative services for the benefits of both market players and the consumers at large.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with NCC\u2019s participatory approach to regulation, this initial stakeholders forum has been convened to formally introduce the project and the appointed consultants to the industry\u201d. Akinloye informed participants and asserted that the forum provides opportunities for stakeholders to gain an understanding into the objective, scope and methodology of the study, as well as to ensure that questionnaire or Request for Information (RFI) developed by the consultants to access the level of competition in the market are well understood.\n\nThus, Akinloye rallied the stakeholders to see the forum as an opportunity \u201cto seek and receive clarification based on presentation delivered by the consultant and to make comments on issues relating to the study. She urged all participants to \u201ccommit to the objectives of the study, by providing complete, timely feedback to questionnaires.\u201d\n\nDirector, Technical Standards and Network Integrity at NCC, Bako Wakil, also joined Akinloye in seeking the full cooperation of licensees in the CIS segment of the telecom market whenever they are approached by the consultants for relevant information either through the instrumentality of the RFI or through one-on-one sessions with consultants in the course of the implementation of the study.\n\nAccording to Wakil, the study is in the interest of the CIS licensees, other players and the consumers. It will also provide the Commission with useful and evidenced-based insights necessary to ensure healthy competition and a level-playing ground in the CIS segment and ensure sustainability in the growth of the telecommunication industry.\n\n\u201cAlso, rest assured of the confidentiality of any information provided to the Commission in the course of this study, no matter how sensitive,\u201d Bako said to the enthusiastic audience.\n\nEarlier in her presentation to telecom stakeholders at the event, Partner at PwC, Mary Iwelumo, amplified the voice of the Commission on the objectives of the study and urged them to cooperate with the firm in providing accurate, timely and adequate responses to the RFI or the questionnaire that would be administered. This will ensure that appropriate information are to obtained to address the challenges in the sector.",

          "text": "A Makurdi High Court in Benue State has acquitted Andrew Ogbuja, a lecturer at the Benue State Polytechnic, Ugbokolo, accused of raping and causing the death of Ochanya Ogbanje, a 13-year-old schoolgirl, in 2018.\n\nJustice Augustine Ityonyiman acquitted Ogbuja of the charges filed against him on Wednesday while delivering judgment on the case at the court in the state capital.\n\nOgbuja and his son, Victor, who are both maternal relations of the victim, were accused of serially raping her until she fell ill and subsequently died.\n\nOchanya was admitted to the Federal Medical Centre in Makurdi for two months before she died on October 17, 2018.\n\nOn October 10, 2019, the Benue State government arraigned 54-year-old Ogbuja before the Makurdi High Court on four counts of rape and Ochanya\u2019s death.\n\nThe Acquittal\n\nDelivering judgment on the case, Justice Ityonyiman held that the prosecution failed to prove the four counts against Mr Ogbuja.\n\nHe explained that the police investigators failed to subject the defendant to medical examination, in order to match his specimen with the findings in the medical reports that were presented before the court.\n\nIn evaluating the evidence, the judge held that two autopsy reports from the Federal Medical Centre in Makurdi and the Nigerian Police Forensic Laboratory in Lagos left him quandary.\n\n\u201cI cannot pick and choose which of the autopsy reports to rely on in reaching a just conclusion of this case,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: 2023: Osinbajo Visits Oba Of Benin, Re-Echoes Desire To Serve\n\nJustice Ityonyiman added that while the autopsy report from the Medical Centre in Makurdi said Miss Ochanya died of \u201cnatural cause\u201d, the one from the police forensic laboratory revealed that the deceased \u201csuffered diseases that were related to sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nDespite narrating her ordeals at the hands of the Ogbujas in a video tendered before the court, he said, \u201cit is regrettable that the deceased could not tell her story before she died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hereby acquit and discharge the defendant of all the four count-charge.\u201d\n\nWife Convicted\n\nElsewhere, Justice Mobolaji Olajunwo of the Federal High Court in Makurdi convicted Ogbuja\u2019s wife, Mrs Felicia, for negligence in the rape of the deceased.\n\nFelicia, on her part, was arraigned by the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) over negligence that led to the rape and death of Ochanya.\n\nThe anti-trafficking agency accused Mrs Ogbuja of failing in her duty to protect the deceased from being raped by her husband and son.\n\nIn Mrs Ogbuja\u2019s case which coincided with that of her husband, Justice Olajunwo held that the defendant failed in her duty to protect Ochanya from \u2018being sexually abused by her son, Victor\u2019.\n\nAccording to her, the victim was being abused by Felicia\u2019s son but the defendant who owed the girl the duty of care to ensure that she was protected from such an act failed in doing so, even when her daughter, Winifred, drew her attention to the sexual assault.\n\nThe judge said the defendant made it impossible for the NAPTIP investigating officer to see and interrogate Winifred in the course of the investigation of the matter.\n\nAgreeing with the prosecution, she said \u201cthe evidence that Ochanya told the defendant (Mrs Ogbuja) about what was going on, and was not successfully challenged,\u201d proved NAPTIP\u2019s case.\n\nJustice Olajunwo also held that Felicia failed to challenge the prosecution\u2019s evidence that she \u201cthreatened to send Ochanya out of her house if she told anyone about the sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cThis evidence has neither been challenged nor controverted. The defendant failed to perform her duty as it concerned the well-being of Ochanya, particularly as it comes to her protection from being sexually abused.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fourth prosecution witness, in his testimony, said Ochanya upon been presented for medical examination complained of passing urine uncontrollably and had serious pain in the lower abdomen.\n\n\u201cWhen Ochanya was examined, it was discovered that the membrane covering the vagina opening was not there, which is an indication that Ochanya had been disvirgined,\u201d the judge stated while recalling the prosecution\u2019s evidence.\n\nBefore sentencing the convict, Felicia\u2019s lawyer, Abel Onoja, pleaded for leniency and called two witnesses in frantic efforts to save his client.\n\nBut Justice Olajunwo sentenced Mrs Ogbuja to five months imprisonment without an option of a fine, after listening to her lawyer\u2019s plea for clemency.\n\n\u201cTaking into consideration the testimonies of witnesses that testified to the defendant\u2019s character, the number of months contained in the law shall be reduced by the court.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the defendant is sentenced to five months imprisonment with no option of fine,\u201d she held.\n\nSearch For Education\n\nMiss Ochanya, in search of a sound education, had left her rural home at Ogene-Amejo for Ugbokolo township where she lived with the Ogbujas. Mrs Ogbuja is said to be Ochanya\u2019s maternal relation.\n\nThe Ogbujas residence, where they lived with the deceased, was said to be located on a street almost opposite the Emmanuel Primary and Secondary School where Ochanya obtained her primary education in Ugbokolo, Benue State.\n\nOchanya, who was a JSS1 pupil of the Federal Government Girls College Gboko in Benue State, died of complications linked to the alleged serial rape by Mr Ogbuja and his fugitive son.\n\nMr Ogbuja was later arraigned on four counts of sexual abuse of the late Ochanya during a period of over five years, which resulted in her death in October 2018.\n\nThe father and son allegedly abused the late Ochanya while she was living with them. But the son, Victor, disappeared after police started looking for him and his father over the case.\n\nDoctors later diagnosed Ochanya with Vesico-Vaginal Fistula (VVF) \u2013 a disease attributed to the serial rape allegedly by the two men.",

          "text": "John Jones is the sort of voter that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cannot afford to lose \u2013 but already has.\n\nJones, who backed Johnson\u2019s Conservatives at the national election three years ago when the party swept to a landslide victory, regrets his decision after the prime minister broke his own coronavirus lockdown laws to attend alcohol-fuelled gatherings in his Downing Street office.\n\nThe 75-year-old retired hospital supplies manager said he won\u2019t vote Conservative again until Johnson has gone.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely disgusted at the way he has behaved,\u201d Jones told Reuters in the market town of Newcastle-under-Lyme in central England, a key battleground in local authority elections being held next week.\n\n\u201cI have had enough of watching him act like a clown. You only have to look at his haircut and the way he dresses to realise that he is not taking this job seriously.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Johnson upended conventional British politics by winning in both the traditional Conservative southern heartlands and more industrial areas in central and northern England.\n\nBut his support has waned as the government grapples with a cost-of-living crisis and revelations about his conduct.\n\nNow many Conservative lawmakers are wondering if he is still an electoral asset, and a poor showing in local elections next Thursday might provoke a leadership challenge.\n\nOne of the most closely watched contests will be Newcastle-under-Lyme, about 170 miles northwest of London.\n\nThe Brexit-backing town, once known for coal and steel, was traditionally a stronghold for the main opposition Labour Party, but the Conservatives won the parliamentary seat in 2019 for the first time in a century, and outright control of the council for the first time ever last year.\n\nLabour councillor David Grocott said he had found widespread anger that senior government officials were partying while the public were obeying strict rules which meant some could not say farewell to loved ones dying in hospital.\n\n\u201cEverybody is allowed to make mistakes, we are all human, but I think the hard thing is he has not broken the rules one time, but multiple times,\u201d said Grocott, who was unable to see his father in hospital before he died from COVID in 2020.\n\nTrevor Johnson, a local Conservative councillor who is standing for re-election, admitted some voters were angry but said the backlash was not as severe as he had feared.\n\n\u201cI think he can bounce back,\u201d he said. Johnson\u2019s name and photo were conspicuous by their absence from his pamphlets.\n\nFOCUS ON UKRAINE\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll after Johnson was fined, almost 80% thought he had lied about parties, while other surveys show the public overwhelmingly think he should resign.\n\nJohnson says he is focused on the major crises of the day \u2013 the highest inflation in three decades and the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn Crawley, a town south of London which has a Conservative member of parliament (MP) but whose council is evenly split, the issue was a key factor for some voters.\n\nTerrina Joughin, 58, a live-in carer, who had to prevent family members from entering homes when her patients died of COVID, is disgusted. \u201cI used to vote Conservative, I don\u2019t even vote at all now because I can\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother Conservative voter Juliet Shenton, 61, also wants Johnson gone. \u201cAre they lying to us about other things?\u201d she asked?\n\nThe prime minister and his supporters will hope such discontent is not widespread, and he remains popular with some.\n\nJohn Lathbury, 86, said he couldn\u2019t care less about parties and would continue to vote Conservative, while Merry Farr, 77, said \u201cBoris\u201d needed to stay and stand up to Russia.\n\nHOW LOW CAN JOHNSON GO?\n\nThe key question will be how bad results need to be for Conservative MPs, a number of whom have already voiced discontent, to turn on Johnson.\n\nElections are being held in local authorities across Wales and Scotland, and mainly in towns and metropolitan areas of England, including London which is already dominated by Labour.\n\nOf almost 7,000 seats being contested, Labour are defending far more than the Conservatives in England.\n\nAn analysis by pollster Find Out Now and political consultancy Electoral Calculus suggested the Conservatives could lose some 800 council seats and Labour could gain control of about 20 councils including Newcastle-under-Lyme and Crawley.\n\nA poor performance in local elections can presage the ousting of an unpopular prime minister. Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May lost some 1,330 seats in May 2019 and in a month announced she would step down.\n\nAcademics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher say a loss of 350 Conservative seats would be bad for the Conservatives but losses might be limited by a lack of enthusiasm for Labour under leader Keir Starmer, whose own position could be under pressure if his party is seen to have underperformed.\n\n\u201cAll he does is slag Boris off and jumps on any bandwagon,\u201d said Jill Jordan, an antiques dealer in Newcastle-under-Lyme who previously voted Labour. \u201cStarmer doesn\u2019t appear to have any ideas of his own. That is not leadership.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "title": "Ukraine Says Russia Taking \u2018Colossal Losses\u2019 in Eastern Battle",
          "text": "Ukraine acknowledged on Friday it was taking heavy losses in Russia\u2019s assault in the east, but said Russia\u2019s losses were even worse, as U.S. President Joe Biden called on Congress to send as much as $33 billion to help Kyiv withstand the attack.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised Biden\u2019s offer of help, which amounts to nearly 10 times the aid Washington has sent so far since the war began on Feb. 24.\n\nIn Kyiv, workers were cleaning up rubble in a residential area after Russia fired two missiles at the capital during a visit on Thursday by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, which Ukraine called an attack on the United Nations itself.\n\nHaving failed in an assault on Kyiv in the north of Ukraine last month, Russia is now trying to fully capture two eastern provinces known as the Donbas.\n\nUkraine has acknowledged losing control of some towns and villages there since the assault began last week, but says Moscow\u2019s gains have come at a massive cost to a Russian force already worn down from its earlier defeat near the capital.\n\n\u201cWe have serious losses but the Russians\u2019 losses are much much bigger\u2026They have colossal losses,\u201d presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said.\n\nBy pledging tens of billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine, Biden has dramatically increased U.S. involvement in the conflict. The United States and its allies are now sending heavy weapons including artillery, with what Washington says is an aim not just to repel Russia\u2019s attack but to weaken its armed forces so it cannot menace its neighbours again.\n\n\u201cWe need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe cost of this fight \u2013 it\u2019s not cheap \u2013 but caving to aggression is going to be more costly.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy tweeted: \u201cThank you @POTUS and the American people for their leadership in supporting Ukraine in our fight against Russian aggression. We defend common values \u2013 democracy and freedom. We appreciate the help. Today it is needed more than ever!\u201d\n\nRussia has said the arrival of Western arms into Ukraine means it is now fighting a \u201cproxy war\u201d against NATO. President Vladimir Putin threatened unspecified retaliation this week, while his foreign minister warned of a threat of nuclear war.\n\nMISSILES HIT KYIV\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s office said Russia was pounding the entire front line in the eastern Donetsk region with rockets, artillery, mortar bombs and aircraft. The Ukrainian general staff said Russia was shelling positions along the line of contact to prevent the Ukrainians from regrouping.\n\nBritain said fighting had been particularly heavy around the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, the main part of the Donbas that Russia is still trying to capture, with an attempted advance south from Russian-held Izium towards Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cDue to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces,\u201d the British defence ministry said in an update.\n\nThe bloodiest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war have been in Mariupol, an eastern port reduced to a wasteland by two months of Russian bombardment and siege.\n\nUkraine says 100,000 civilians are still in the city, which is mostly occupied by Russia. Hundreds of civilians are holed up with last remaining defenders in underground bunkers beneath a huge steel works.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s office said an operation was planned on Friday to get civilians out of the plant, giving no details.\n\nIn the capital, normal life has largely returned after weeks in which residents were forced to shelter in metro stations from bombardment. The front line, which come right to the outskirts of Kyiv in March, is now hundreds of miles away. Foreign dignitaries have been flying in to pay their respects to Zelenskiy and his government.\n\nBut Russia can still hit the city with long range missiles, as it did on Thursday, during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres, in what Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov called \u201can attack on the security of the Secretary General and on world security\u201d.\n\nNo one was killed but at least four people were wounded in the missile strike in the capital, which blew out windows and scattered rubble across the streets.\n\n\u201cKyiv is still a dangerous place and Kyiv is still the target of Russians, of course. The capital of Ukraine is the goal and they want to occupy it,\u201d Mayor Vitali Klitschko said, supervising the cleanup.\n\nOn Thursday, Guterres visited Borodianka, one of the Kyiv suburbs that Russia had occupied in March, leaving dead bodies in the ruined streets when its forces withdrew.\n\n\u201cI imagine my family in one of those homes, now destroyed and black. I see my granddaughters running away in panic, part of the family eventually killed,\u201d Guterres told reporters in Borodianka, surrounded by scorched, windowless apartment blocks.\n\n\u201cInnocent civilians were living in these buildings, they were paying the highest price for a war which they have not contributed to at all.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Elon Musk has sold 4.4 million shares of Tesla stock worth roughly $4 billion, most likely to help fund his purchase of Twitter.\n\nMusk reported the sale in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The shares were sold over the past few days, at prices ranging from $872.02 to $999.13.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man, who is the CEO of Tesla, tweeted that he doesn\u2019t plan any further sales of the company\u2019s shares.\n\nMost of the sales took place on Tuesday, when Tesla shares closed down 12%, a huge single-day drop.\n\nAnalysts said Tesla investors fear Musk will be distracted by Twitter and less engaged in running the electric car company. Twitter agreed to be acquired by Musk on Monday for $44 billion.\n\nIt appeared that Musk would borrow up to $25.5 billion from a slew of banks to pay for the takeover of Twitter, but the stock sale potentially could fund some of that.\n\nThe deal to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share was announced earlier this week and is expected to close sometime this year. But before the deal is completed, shareholders will have to weigh in. So will regulators in the U.S. and in countries where Twitter does business.\n\nSo far though, few hurdles are expected, despite objections from some of Twitter\u2019s own employees and from users who worry about Musk\u2019s stance on free speech and what it might mean for harassment and hate speech on the platform.\n\nTesla shares closed Thursday down slightly at $877.51.

          "title": "Fuel Subsidy Causing Deterioration in Nigeria\u2019s Fiscal Balance,IMF Says",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday maintained that prolonged payment of petrol subsidy in Nigeria was affecting the country\u2019s fiscal balance despite revenue increase from rise in global oil price.\n\nThe Washington-based institution stated this in its latest Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa titled: \u201cA New Shock and Little Room to Maneuver,\u201d released yesterday.\n\nIt stated: \u201cNet commodity exporters can receive fiscal windfalls only if they contain subsidy expenditures. For example, some oil exporters provide expensive and generalised energy subsidies to the domestic population which could lead to a deterioration in fiscal balances despite the revenue increase associated with higher export prices in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTherefore, removing generalised subsidies is crucial to ensure that the rise in commodity prices generates fiscal savings. It is then essential that these savings are directed largely to strengthening fiscal sustainability supported by strong governance frameworks, given the precarious conditions faced by many countries.\u201d\n\nThe fund reiterated that the country\u2019s foreign exchange policy was weighing on its growth, distorting investment, encouraging rent seeking. It also noted uncertainties in the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe multilateral institution also pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s growth was stronger than anticipated due to increase in manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cFor countries with limited reserves, authorities have sometimes offered favorable rates, including to specific sectors. But the resulting parallel market for foreign exchange in Nigeria and Zimbabwe can weigh on growth distorting investment, encouraging rent seeking, and adding to uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThe decision to return to a more unified framework is often difficult, but experience suggests that the shift to a market-clearing official rate is not in itself likely to lead to a sharp increase in inflation, as prices in the real economy tend to reflect the less-favorable parallel exchange rate; and removing exchange-market distortions can give a substantial boost to development, by reducing uncertainty and strengthening competitiveness.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the exchange reform implemented in South Sudan last year prompted a significant appreciation of the parallel market rate, helping to reduce inflation and insulating the country from rising global food prices,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report further reiterated that Nigeria\u2019s economic growth was expected to reach 3.4 percent in 2022, falling back to 2.9 per cent from 2024 onwards.\n\nIt added: \u201cNigeria\u2019s growth outlook has improved through higher oil prices and a stronger-than-anticipated recovery of manufacturing and agriculture. Growth is expected to reach 3.4 percent in 2022, falling back to 2.9 percent from 2024 onwards.\n\n\u201cThe outlook is subject to high uncertainty associated with oil prices and financial conditions. Moreover, low vaccination rates, rising security risks, and elevated price pressures weigh negatively on the medium-term growth outlook. Diversification away from oil will be critical to raise growth potential sustainably and reduce volatility.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Director of the IMF\u2019s African Department Abebe Aemro Selassie, while speaking on the report during a virtual media briefing at the ongoing IMF/World Bank spring meeting yesterday, noted that the recovery in sub-Saharan Africa picked up in the third quarter of 2021 and held up despite the onset of a fourth COVID-19 wave at the end of the year.\n\nHe said Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s estimated growth in 2021 had been revised upward from 3.7 per cent to 4.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cHigher oil prices may generate a windfall gain for the region\u2019s 8 oil exporters. But for the other 37 countries, they will worsen trade imbalances and increase living costs.\n\n\u201cIndeed, over the past couple of months we have increased our inflation projections significantly lifting the regional average for 2022 by a full four percentage points, and representing the worst outcome since 2008.\n\n\u201cThis year, eleven countries will face double digit inflation; almost all of these have flexible exchange rates, and almost half of these are fragile.\n\n\u201cFor most countries, the new crisis comes at an extremely difficult time as the COVID-19 pandemic enters its third year, fiscal and international buffers are already under strain, and policy space is limited.\n\n\u201cLooking beyond the pandemic and current geopolitical tensions, creating jobs and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals will require strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d",
