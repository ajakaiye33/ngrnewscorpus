          "text": "Femi Gbajabiamila\n\n\u2022Assures on passage of electoral bill next month\n\n\u2022Recalls Buhari was ready to address parliament in 2020 before misunderstanding set in\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu, ABUJA\n\nFollowing the issues around the Federal Government\u2019s ban of Twitter in the country, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has described social media as the most potent weapon for good and evil, which must be regulated.\n\nHe said though the constitution had guaranteed freedom of speech and expression, it must not, however, be at the expensive of national and individual security.\n\nGbajabiamila, who featured on a Channels TV programme \u201cMr. Speaker Chats with Young Nigerians\u201d, said everything in life had to be regulated.\n\nHe said the National Assembly would have long enacted a law for the regulation of the social media but for the opposition that had always greeted the move by Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe social media is the most potent weapon for good and for evil. While we welcome the good, we must prepare over the evil. You cannot use the idea of free speech to destroy me.\n\n\u201cMost democracies in the world today are making efforts to regulate the social media and the National Assembly has been considering regulating the social media for long. But each time the issue comes up, Nigerians kick against it.\n\n\u201cIt is something we need to do because we have a responsibility to protect every single citizen in this country and that is what we must do,\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, who recalled the face-off between the federal government and the Twitter, assured that the National Assembly would always synthesize all the issues, thereto, before taking a decision.\n\nRecall that a joint committee of the House is currently interfacing with the federal government to ascertain reasons for the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are elected by the people to represent them and ordinarily, we should be on their side. But this is not a beauty contest. You must listen to all sides. Government says Twitter poses threat to national security. What are the information available to them that we are not privy to?\n\n\u201cThey have also said that it is not about the President\u2019s tweet which was taken down but a mere coincidence. We are listening to government because we have heard from the people.\n\n\u201cWe agree that there is freedom of speech but the government is saying that freedom is not absolute. Even at that, the freedom can be protected but not at instance of the country.\n\n\u201cI am happy that twitter and government are already talking. At the end, I hope that the issue will be resolved in the best way possible,\u201d the speaker said.\n\nSpeaking on the Electoral Act amendment bill, Gbajabiamila said the House would pass the bill into law before proceeding on annual summer vacation in July this year.\n\nHe also decried the misunderstanding of their constitutional expectations by the members of the public.\n\nAccording to him, the public x-rays the members of the National Assembly in the light of executive functions which included projects execution, whereas their primary responsibility was lawmaking and representation.\n\nTaking questions on the invitation of President Muhammadu Buhari to address the House in December, 2020, which later became a subject of controversy, Gbajabiamila said the President was determined to address the Parliament before a misunderstanding erupted that marred the arrangements.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Fuel: Subsidy must go to move economy ahead \u2014 FG",
          "text": "File image used to illustrate the story\n\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young & Udeme Akpan\n\nThe Federal Government yesterday restated the need to deregulate the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry through a market-driven pricing of products to boost the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, who stated this at the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, Forum in Abuja, also said the country \u201caccidentally\u201d discovered 206 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves while in search of crude oil.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI will say that my stand on fuel subsidy and deregulation is well-known. I strongly believe that for this country to move forward, for our economy to make the progress it desires, we need to have a market-driven pricing of products.\n\n\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, people\u2019s view that if the refineries are working, importation of products will stop is not the real issue on ground.\n\n\n\n\u2018Refineries not working because of subsidy\u2019\n\n\n\nContending that subsidy was part of the things that made the refineries to stop operating in the country, Sylva said: \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss cannot sustain itself.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the years, the refineries couldn\u2019t sustain themselves and all of them died. So, if you do not deregulate, you will find out that the refineries, even if you fix them today, cannot be commercially operated because the refineries need maintenance and they need to run.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe noted that Dangote Group, for example, sited its refinery near the sea to aid exports and enable it make more money for sustainability.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf he sells within Nigeria in this subsidised environment, he will not break even. So, that is the way it is and we must look at it because, I know that a lot of Nigerians think that we must carry on like this but in the end, I think it is better for us to deregulate,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described as unfortunate people\u2019s perception about subsidy, which had made the common man on the street to begin to fight government.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201csubsidy never favours them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the minister said: \u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening.\n\n\u201cYou must have heard of all the subsidy scams a few years ago; people were making billions on these same subsidies. And when you say you want to take it out, the common man is the one on the street but at the end of the day, is it the common man that is benefiting? I don\u2019t think they are the biggest beneficiaries.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018All fuel connected to commoners deregulated\u2019\n\n\n\nHe also noted that all the fuels that were connected to the common man had been deregulated.\n\n\n\n\u201cKerosene, which the common man uses to cook in a stove and used in the village to burn firewood is deregulated. The diesel that is used to move the trucks that move food from farms to market is deregulated; but petrol which is the preferred fuel for big people is the fuel that has defied deregulation.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as foreign exchange, forex, is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex. People will be able to access forex for imports, government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, since government will no longer be subsidising, all that money that will be gained, which is over a trillion naira yearly, will now be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal, if there is deregulation,\u201d the minister said.\n\n\n\n\u2018206 trillion cubic feet of gas accidentally discovered\u2019\n\nOn the discovery of additional 600 trillion cubic feet of gas reserve, Sylva said:\u201dWe have a lot of gas in this country. We have 206 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis number is already discovered in gas reserves and this 206 trillion cubic feet reserve was found while looking for oil, so it was accidentally discovered.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were actually going to look for crude oil and we found gas, and in that process of accidentally finding gas, we have found up to 206 tcf.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, the belief is that if we really aim to look for gas with dedication, we will find up to 600 trillion cubic meters of gas.\u201d\n\n\n\nImpact of COVID on the oil sector\n\n\n\nSylva noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had some positive impact on the Nigerian oil and gas sector, despite its negative effect on the global economy.\n\n\n\nHe said the pandemic forced Nigerians to take over the running of the oil and gas industry as most of the expatriates working in the sector had to travel to their countries because of the lock-down.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey (expatriates) have to rush out so that they will be locked down in their countries, and when that happened, it means that we lost a lot of expatriate personnel.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the good side of COVID-19 for us is that our Nigerians were able to step into their shoes.\u201d\n\n\n\nRehabilitation of Port Harcourt Refinery\n\n\n\nThe minister said the oil-producing communities where the Port Harcourt Refinery Company, PHRC, is located are being carried along in the rehabilitation exercise.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not the government that will engage directly with the communities, we are the government and we have been able to give the contract to EPC contractors. Part of the EPC contractors\u2019 role is engagement with communities,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe noted that rehabilitation of the refinery was done through international tenders, adding that international companies responded accordingly.\n\n\n\nIt will be recalled that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, had on April 6, signed the EPC contract with Maire Tecnimont SPA, an Italian company, for rehabilitation of PHRC.\n\n\n\n\u2018PIB\u2019ll be passed soon\u2019\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, the minister assured that it would be passed in the next few weeks.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am very optimistic that the PIB will be passed very soon. I have always thanked and commended the National Assembly for their commitment as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have seen a lot of commitment from the National Assembly; they have gone on retreat because of this and just yesterday (Saturday), we also engaged and they are very much on the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom all the engagements that we have had with stakeholders, I believe that the PIB will be passed within a matter of weeks, if not next week, it will be weeks after.\n\n\u201cBut definitely, you can see a clear line of sight to the end of the journey as far as the PIB is concerned.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nSylva said that the PIB will be the foundation of continued growth of the oil and gas industry, adding \u201cit is unfortunate that the passage was delayed for over 20 years and for very good reasons.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the delay was because the petroleum industry was at the core of the economy of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be changing the laws with that kind of sector too often because people are making long term investments with long term projections based on your laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you now say you want to be changing your laws very often, the climate will not be stable for investors and that is why it is okay for me that this has taken this long in a way.\n\n\u201cAnd also, it tells you one other story that if it took us 20 years to pass PIB, then you can imagine that this is not an easy law to pass.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat means, when we pass it, it can be clear about the Nigerian investment climate,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nRecall that PIB had passed all the stages and public hearing at the National Assembly and a committee was set up to finalise the findings on the bill.\n\nAt the just-concluded Nigeria International Petroleum Summit, NIPS, speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan, assured that the bill would be passed in June.\n\n\n\nLawan said the 9th National Assembly would continue to support all efforts to ensure the passage of the PIB.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will give Nigeria a fair Act; we will listen to everyone, we have a cooperative approach, so we are working with all the stakeholders to get things done right.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been able to achieve consultation on PIB and we are working with the joint committee and hopefully the bill will be passed in June.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are conscious of the fact that we must give Nigeria a legal framework that will help to guide effective utilisation of the huge deposits of hydrocarbon for growth,\u201d he had said.\n\nStakeholders react\n\n\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, had its National Executive Council, NEC meeting in Abuja last week, restated its opposition to the deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nThe NLC had in a communique signed by the President and Acting General Secretary, Ayuba Wabba and Ismail Bello, resolved that Nigerian workers would automatically down tools as soon as increase in the price of petrol was announced by government.\n\n\n\nReacting to the minister\u2019s declaration on deregulation, The executive director, Spaces for Change, Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, said: \u201cThe rising call for full deregulation of the petroleum sector deserves rigorous scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The expected kick-off of a privately-owned refinery is being touted as Nigeria\u2019s passport to end products\u2019 importation, reducing foreign exchange demand for fuel imports, while serving as a shortcut for the wider oil sector reforms.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere have also been calls made to insert certain clauses in the petroleum reform bill\u2014 Petroleum Industry Bill\u2014mandating the grant of import licenses to only companies with active refining licenses.\n\n\n\n\u201cCalls have also been made to encourage investment in local refining by granting dominant refining licensing status efforts to certain business players. Underneath these calls lay the foundation for a market monopoly, including multiple layers of barriers to economic freedoms, which make it harder for smaller companies to compete in the petroleum industry in the future.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of these hint at an urgent need for an in-depth inquiry into the current regulatory prescriptions in order to check whether there are any potential barriers to the competitive landscape that might affect the oil and gas industry and inhibit the economic freedom of citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria should take it easy and slowly with the plans for full deregulation of the sector. There seem to be so many landmines underneath that call.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe chairman, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, MOMAN, Tunji Oyebanji, said in his reaction: \u201cWe have been saying it and it has always been an issue. Like the many issues in the country, if we don\u2019t have the will to do something at the appropriate time, the situation will force itself on us eventually.\n\nThat is what has happened to us at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe governors had earlier noted that the current situation is not sustainable. However, that desire has to be translated into action. We await further reactions from the government on the subject, remember government says it is still discussing with labour who are opposed to deregulation at the moment.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs to benefits of deregulation, it is no longer a matter of choice but an imperative for survival. If you doubt, let\u2019s wait and see what happens if we continue the way we are going.\u201d\n\nOn plight to Nigerians, he said: \u201cWe would have to adjust our lifestyle. For individuals, when there are changes we should adjust. For Nigerians, we like to enjoy without rational thinking. When people are saying we would suffer, yes it will happen if we don\u2019t adjust our spending habits.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the benefits, Mr. Oyebanji explained that full deregulation of the downstream sector would set Nigeria ahead of other African economies in the area of local petroleum products refining as against exporting crude oil for refining.\n\n\n\nHe listed other benefits to be expected from the process as; \u201calignment with the Nigeria National Petroleum Policy, construction and maintenance of refineries, product availability in the country and for export, increased foreign exchange earnings, including transforming the country into a centre for innovation and technology.\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cOthers are the growth of local refining capacity, leading Nigeria to become a net exporter of refined petroleum to West and Central Africa, and meeting local, regional demands and earning Nigeria increased foreign exchange, a win-win for the Nigerian consumer, industry stakeholders and the country, importation of PMS by marketers can resume, freeing the Federal Government from the unsustainable cost and increasing debt the burden associated with a regulated pricing system.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Professor Wumi Iledare, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, GNPC Professor & Chair in Petroleum Economics & Management, Institute for Oil and Gas Studies, Cape Coast, Ghana, said: \u201cThere can be no deregulation without the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB becoming an Act. Another populist president can always come and reverse it..\u201d",
          "summary": "He said: \u201cI will say that my stand on fuel subsidy and deregulation is well-known.\nIt will be recalled that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, had on April 6, signed the EPC contract with Maire Tecnimont SPA, an Italian company, for rehabilitation of PHRC.\n\u2018PIB\u2019ll be passed soon\u2019On the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, the minister assured that it would be passed in the next few weeks.\n\u2018\u2019The expected kick-off of a privately-owned refinery is being touted as Nigeria\u2019s passport to end products\u2019 importation, reducing foreign exchange demand for fuel imports, while serving as a shortcut for the wider oil sector reforms.\n\u201cThere have also been calls made to insert certain clauses in the petroleum reform bill\u2014 Petroleum Industry Bill\u2014mandating the grant of import licenses to only companies with active refining licenses.",

Read it HERE .\n\nOwokoniran, in his reconciliatory message to members on Sunday, said: \u201cThe councillorship (election) is at hand and our resolve is to win at the polls.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we need not dissipate our energy on issues that distracts us from our focus, especially when there are institutional mechanisms in place to address these issues.\n\n\u201cRegardless of which side of the divide you belong, please let us reflect on our collective mission and understand that unless we work together for the common good of the party, we shall continue to fall short of our expectations.\n\n\u201cYes, we have crises on our hands given the timing of the court ruling. But the judiciary works with its own calendar. So the timing poses a challenge to us to address as members desirous to bring home the trophy.\n\n\u201cOur goal cannot be accomplished by throwing our hands in the air raising the dust. We must thoroughly read the verdict of the court.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary performing its constitutional duties is out of bounds to us either as institution or individuals to be derided and dragged into political arena.\n\n\u201cWe can agree or not with a particular judgment of the court. That is why the institutional mechanism is there to pursue justice up to Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt is within the rights of every individual or institution to appeal their cases up to the highest level as enshrined in our National constitution. It is a given tool to pursue justice.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing anyone can do to prevent an aggrieved litigant from pursuing justice. But while pursuing these individual rights, we must be mindful of individual obligations and respect for the rule of law.\n\n\u201cDisrespect to the rule of law amounts to obstruction of justice. It cannot be in our interest and that of our great party to obstruct justice.\n\nMoreover, Owokoniran added, there can be no vacuum in dispensing duties and obligations in government, public or private institutions.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time,\u201d he said, \u201cregardless of what has happened there are no victors, no vanquished, we are all winners.\n\n\u201cBoth the court-ousted chairman and the legally-recognised chairman should meet and discuss the state of the party and how to win back Lagos.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he emphasised the need for members\u2019 collective interest to advance the party\u2019s goals, rather than who holds public office, especially now that peace has begun to reign within the party.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2022Says deceased\u2019s neck was broken with bruises on his body\n\n\u2022UNILAG Senate to decide Chidinma\u2019s fate\n\nBy Evelyn Usman, Adesina Wahab & Kingsley Adegboye\n\nTHE family of late Michael Usifo Ataga, who was allegedly stabbed to death by Miss Chidinma Ojukwu, a 300 level student of the University of Lagos, last week, in the Lekki area of Lagos, has urged the Police to carry out an in-depth investigation into the matter, to unravel identities of others involved.\n\nThe family\u2019s position is based on the suspicion that some yet-to-be-identified persons were involved in their son\u2019s death.\n\nThis came on a day that management of the University of Lagos, UNILAG, said it will this week suspend Miss Chidinma Ojukwu, who is a part-time student.\n\nUsifo\u2019s neck was broken \u2014Family\n\nBut a member of the family, who spoke with Vanguard in confidence, yesterday, disclosed that there were minor bruises on late Usifo\u2019s body during its inspection in the morgue.\n\nIt was further revealed that late Usifo\u2019s neck was broken when inspected. Sources also disclosed that there were marks on his wrists, suggesting that he could have been bound.\n\nREAD ALSO: Why I stabbed Super TV CEO, Ataga, to death \u2014 UNILAG student\n\nA rope suspected to have been used to tie his hands was reportedly found inside the short-let apartment on 19 Adewale Oshin Street in Lekki phase 1.\n\nElder brother to the deceased, Dr. Isi Ataga, in a statement entitled: Who will speak for Usifo Ataga?\u2019, also confirmed these findings.\n\nHe said: \u201cUsifo died a horrific death. He was not stabbed two or even five times; he was stabbed multiple times. His hands were bound tightly and the marks were still all over his wrists, accompanied with evidence of torture and assault even as his corpse lay in the morgue.\n\n\u201cAnd no one in the entire building heard his screams because he was gagged. Let that sink in, he was bound, gagged and tortured!\n\n\u201cThe now-viral video of the room with the deceased lying on the floor shows a room with blood-stained walls and floor, evidence of a ferocious struggle. One person could never have carried these out.\u201d\n\nGo beyond Chidimma\u2019s arrest\n\nSimilarly, the Ataga family has urged the Police to go beyond the arrest of the suspect.\n\nThe family, in another statement entitled: Libelous Publications In Respect of Murder Of Michael Usifo Ataga: Demand For Restraint By Social Media Practitioners/Persons,\u2019 by Rickey Tarfa & Co, solicitor to the family, warned those behind the social media publications to refrain from publishing falsehood that impinges negatively on the integrity of the deceased, wife and children or face lawsuits.\n\nThe statement signed by Olusegun Jolaawo, SAN, on behalf of the law firm, urged Nigerians to allow the police to conduct their investigations without any distraction or interference.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe, hereby, admonish the publishers of these stories to employ whatever shreds of decency and decorum they can find in themselves to desist from their false and misleading stories and let the investigating authorities carry out an effective investigation in the hope of apprehending the perpetrators of this heinous crime and their accomplices.\n\n\u201cYes we know that Chidinma Adaora Ojukwu has been arrested and yes we know that investigation is continuing. Our client is however convinced that there is much more to this than is already apparent from the police investigation,\u201d Jolaawo said in the statement.\n\n\u201dIt has become apparent even to the most undiscerning reader that from the variety and inherent malice in most of the said publications that they are planted to embarrass and malign Usifo Ataga, Brenda Ataga and the family, and to serve as a smokescreen to enable the perpetrators of the heinous crime to cover their tracks\u201d.\n\n\u201dOur client appreciates the efforts of the law enforcement agencies in their investigations thus far, and will not descend into particulars concerning any of the said false narratives so as not to inadvertently aid the perpetrators of the murder in covering their tracks.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer lamented that the tragic incident of the cold-blooded murder of late Michael Ataga has inundated all strata of the media with inconceivable stories being peddled on all sorts of platforms about the incident and therefore called for restraints from the publishers of the unfounded stories.\n\nJolaawo said: \u201cOur client at this juncture requests that the well-meaning public allow the family to mourn their departed son, father and husband with some privacy and decency.\n\n\u201cOur client also feels very strongly about the unbridled activities of bloggers on the social media space concerning this incident and firmly demands that the said bloggers cease from peddling falsehood aimed at maligning the deceased, wife and children.\n\n\u201cThe family will not be intimidated by these bloggers\u2019 activities and insist that the police be allowed to do their work.\n\n\u201dOur client hereby demands that the false publications and the several ordinarily unrelated stories and pictures of late Michael Usifo Ataga and Brenda Ataga be pulled down with immediate effect failing which our client shall take prompt and appropriate action to seek redress for the apparent instances of libel and slander as appropriate.\n\nUNILAG Senate to decide on Chidinma\u2019s fate\n\nMeanwhile, Vanguard gathered that the Senate of the institution is set to meet on the matter and decide her fate before the commencement of activities to mark the 51st Convocation Ceremony of the university.\n\nThe activities lined up for the convocation ceremony will kick off on Wednesday with a press briefing by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.\n\nSources at the university said: \u201cThere are reasons the university has not officially spoken on the matter. But the Senate of the university will meet and decide her case before we start activities for our convocation ceremony. The convocation ceremony would have held early last year but for what happened then.\n\n\u201cThe ceremony is going to start on Wednesday and we don\u2019t want that ugly incident to take the shine off the event and when official action is taken about the matter, it won\u2019t be what people will focus on when we are holding the convocation ceremony.\n\n\u201cWhat she reportedly told the police while being paraded, and other materials about her case would be used to decide her fate and she is going to be suspended until her fate is decided by the court.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano, Laleye Dipo in Minna, Daji Sani in Yola and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nThe efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to reclaim old grazing routes for herdsmen may be hampered by the building of roads, hospitals, schools and other public utilities on the ways carved out for feeding cattle in the 1950s, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nContrary to the clamour for an end to open grazing and the need to adopt modern ranching techniques to curb incessant clashes with farmers, Buhari has insisted that the federal government will reclaim the old grazing routes for free movement of herders.\n\nHowever, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed that the grazing routes have been taken over, over the years, by modern facilities built for the public good.\n\nIn Kano State, the state government has acknowledged that the grazing routes have been taken over by public infrastructure, including schools.\n\nFollowing this development, the state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, has set up a Rural Grazing Area that is popularly known as (RUGA), as part of his government\u2019s efforts to secure alternative grazing areas and accommodation for herdsmen.\n\nGanduje\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Abba Anwar, told THISDAY at the weekend that the RUGA in Kano has become the first cattle herders\u2019 settlement in the country, where the nomads are to be accommodated for expansive grazing of their flock.\n\nHe stated that the first phase of 25 housing units out of the projected 200, situated on 4,413 hectares of land at Dansoshiya Forest in Kiru Council Area of the state has been delivered by the state government.\n\nAnwar added that work is in progress on phase two and phase three of the project.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that at Falgore forest in Tudun Wada Local Government Area, the remnants of the cattle routes have been lost due to the infiltration of bandits and their attendant negative activities.\n\nGanduje, however, has urged herders to stop open grazing and return to the state, saying there is now modern grazing of animals going on at Dansoshiya Forest.\n\nHe said the investments made by his administration in grazing areas would curb the recurring clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe governor added that fodder seeds, which will be cultivated at Dudduru in Ajingi Local Government Area will be planted at Dansoshiya Forest to provide feeds for cattle and other small ruminants.\n\nAlthough Niger State has 11 grazing routes, covering about 1,865 kilometres, 1,368 kilometres of these routes are primary routes while the remaining 496 kilometres are secondary routes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Magama to Rijau route is an international route linking the country with the Benin Republic from Borgu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nBut the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Dr. Jonathan Wasa, told THISDAY in an interview that all the routes have been encroached upon by major highways, private developers, including small-scale industries.\n\nAccording to him, with the advent of development, cattle now share the major highways with motorists.\n\nHe stated that the state does not have the resources to reclaim the routes taken over by highways and other infrastructure.\n\nWasa said due to the encroachment on the grazing routes, the major focus of the state government is to organise nomads and others into groups and settle them in grazing reserves as being done in other parts of the world.\n\nHe stated that there are the Bobi grazing reserves, which span over 36,000 hectares located in Mariga and Magama local government areas.\n\nIn addition, the state government has also designated seven other reserves. These include: Audi Kanchi in Lavun LGA, Sheyi in Shiroro LGA, Garin- Gabas in Rafi LGA, Gabi in Lapai Ndadokun and Kpotun Woro in Agaie LGA and Iri in Rijau LGA.\n\n\u201cWe are advocates of ranching but it has to be done gradually; it cannot be done abruptly,\u201d Wasa added.\n\nIn Adamawa State, the Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry for Livestock Production, Alhaji Abdulrahman Tukur, told THISDAY that the state government had set up a committee to address the frequent clashes between farmers and herders.\n\nHe said the committee had submitted its report to the state government in which is recommended, among others, that the state government should reclaim the grazing reserves for the settlement of herdsmen and stop their movements.\n\nTukur said the old grazing routes had been taken over by schools, primary healthcare centres, roads, petrol stations and other facilities, which will not allow for movement of cattle.\n\nHe said the ministry had earlier before the wet season set up a committee for each of the 30 grazing reserves gazetted and identified in the map of the state to sensitise stakeholders on the plan to reclaim the grazing reserves to settle the herders.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe committees are working with already list of encroachers on the grazing reserves and discussions are in top gear to reclaim these grazing reserves.\n\n\u201cThose farmers that are farming on the grazing reserves; we allow them to continue farming temporarily but when they do their harvest, they would allow the herders\u2019 cattle to feed on the residues of their crops until we make the condition better for herders and stop them from movement.\u201d\n\nIn Nasarawa State, THISDAY gathered that the state government has donated all the seven grazing reserves located at Awe, Keana, Doma, Assakio, Konva, Gitata and Kurudu to the federal government for the National Livestock Transformation Programme (NLTP), as part of the efforts to stop the free movement of cattle.\n\nThe Commissioner for Agriculture and Water Resources, Prof. Alanana Otaki, told THISDAY that the state government has succeeded in claiming all gazetted cattle grazing reserves in the state without hitches.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government has also reclaimed the grazing reserves to settle herdsmen.\n\nIn a telephone interview with THISDAY, the Commissioner for Careers and Security matters, Col. Garba Moyi (rtd), said the reserves were inside the forests.\n\n\u201cFor us in Sokoto, the policy is not new to us. I could recall when I was a local government chairman some years ago, I introduced the policy which was also adopted by other local governments in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMoyi added:\u201d \u201cMost of these grazing reserves are in the bush and we directed the Fulani to graze on any crop planted on them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Zamfara State Government stated that it would use the grazing reserves to resettle the herders, being the worst hit by the clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to the Governor, Mr. Zalaini Bappa, said even some former governors who trespassed on the grazing reserves returned the land.\n\nAccording to him, the state government has also started building Ruga for the Fulani in order to prevent clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Petrol Subsidy Bites Harder, NNPC Proposes N114.3bn Deduction in June",
          "text": "\u2022Under-recovery quadrupled in four months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s three tiers of government may have to look elsewhere to augment revenues accruing monthly from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is set to make another N114.2 billion deduction from oil revenues in June to pay for petrol subsidy.\n\nA document obtained by THISDAY from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, detailing the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the committee, which took place between June 22 and 23, indicated that as earlier reported, the corporation, which has continued to shoulder the payment of what it calls under-recovery, deducted N126.2 billion from FAAC for May.\n\nWhat the NNPC has termed under-recovery is the difference between the actual market rate of petrol and the price at which the commodity is sold at the pump, which the federation bears in order to keep the pump price stable at N162 per litre.\n\nHowever, whereas it made zero contribution to the Federation Account in April, which was shared in May, the national oil company managed to remit about N29 billion from its finances to the joint account in May cycle, which was distributed among the three tiers last week.\n\nFor January to May\u2019s funding performance, the data showed that under-recovery or subsidy claims deducted from oil revenues by the NNPC amounted to N25.374 billion in February, N60.396 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April. But it rose astronomically to N126.298 billion in May before falling to N114 billion in June.\n\nThese implied that the deduction by the NNPC more than quadrupled from the N25.374 billion in February to N114 billion in June.\n\nThis development has justified the clamour for the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry to allow market forces to determine the price of petrol.\n\nHowever, the NNPC remitted a marginal net sum of N29.647 to FAAC in May, which was shared in June, as opposed to its zero contribution in April, its N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nTo date, according to the document, the NNPC has been able to contribute a net sum of N225.852 billion to the federation for the year, out of its yearly projected remittance of N1.473 trillion and monthly value addition of N122.7 billion, leaving a variance of N820.684 billion.\n\nThe presentation, signed by Mr. Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Umar Ajiya, showed that the N50 billion, which is part of the corporation\u2019s financial obligations to its Joint Venture (JV) partners, meant to have been subtracted from the latest round of deductions remains pending.\n\nGross revenue from JV crude, gas and other receipts for May was N320.314 billion, less royalty of N58.3 billion, JV cost recovery of N124 billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N104.4 billion, to yield a profit after-tax value of N33.26 billion.\n\nThe document showed that for April, crude oil and gas sales and receipts, available in May and shared in June, the volume of export crude oil stood at 2.78 million barrels with a monetary value of $181.191 million and equivalent of N69.360 billion, while domestic crude oil due in July was 6.63 million barrels and sold at $434.8 million. Added to export crude oil, the revenue generated was $616.037 million.\n\nNLNG feedstock gas was 27.605 MBTU valued at $38.5 million or about N16.011 billion while the total oil and gas sales stood at $654.601 million or roughly N85.3 billion, according to the corporation.\n\nIn May, export crude oil receipt was $167.7 million, about N64.2 billion, NLNG feedstock gas amounted to $34.31 million, the equivalent of N13.17 billion, while the gas company\u2019s paid arrears stood at N623.4 million, to hit a total of N77.96 billion for the receipt from oil and gas for the month.\n\nAll the transactions were hinged on N382.80 to one dollar exchange rate as advised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), according to the national oil company.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe sum of N126,298,457,944.36 was deducted as value shortfall resulting from the difference between the landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn addition, May value shortfall of N114,337,097,352.49 is to be deducted from June federation proceeds in July 2021 FAAC meeting. Also, the balance of March 2021 value shortfall of N50,000,000,000.00 remains outstanding.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 9.42Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in April 2021 recorded 23.59 per cent increase relative to the 7.62MbbIs lifted in March, while Nigeria maintained 1.4 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in April 2021.\n\n\u201cCrude oil export revenue received in May 2021 amounted to $167.72 million, equivalent to N64.2 billion. Domestic gas receipts in the month were N2.9 billion. Feedstock valued at $38.56 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $34.32 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\n\u201cThe sum of $16.53 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in May 2021,\u201d it stated.\n\nA total loss of 4.527 million barrels of crude was recorded during the month due to shut-ins, repairs, leaks, power outages as well as shutdowns due to protests as a result of non-payment of community workers\u2019 salaries in Batan station and Olomoro, Uzere and Kokori.\n\nOther issues resulting in shutdowns included seawater pump trips, technical issues like high gas to oil ratio or production deferment due to vessel swap.\n\nOf the government \u2018calendarised\u2019 priority projects worth $2.680 billion, given a $536 million monthly budget, the NNPC stated that it had so far funded the projects by $636.472 million from January to May.\n\nThe document showed an outstanding balance of $1.464 billion in JV cash call arrears to International Oil Companies (IOCs) as of May 31, with the NNPC having offset $3.22 billion from a total negotiated debt of $4.689 billion.\n\nThe national oil company told FAAC that it spent N2.263 billion on security and maintenance, N1.580 billion on pipeline and other facilities repairs as well as the payment of a \u201cstrategic holding\u201d of N304.183 million, totalling N4.148 billion in May.\n\nIn addition, it spent N4.412 billion on national domestic gas development, N3.91 billion on gas infrastructure development, N659 million on crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses, N3.2 billion on frontier exploration services and N196 million on renewable energy development.\n\nBesides, the corporation said it expended N5 billion on export financing, N8.3 billion on the non-functional refineries and N83.3 billion on the ongoing Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nDepot price of fuel remained at N128, while 1.885 billion litres were imported and landing cost for the 35 import vessels that brought in fuel ranged from N185.17 to N199.90.\n\nLast week, NNPC told the nation that Nigeria now loses about 42 million litres of petrol to smuggling through the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the national oil company stated that the under-recovery or the subsidy that the government pays on the product every month has begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation unable to contribute to the national coffers, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nSpeaking when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Service (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the petroleum ministry, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, said smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre, adding that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: Drug Trafficking, Abuse Pose More Threat than Insurgency, Banditry",
          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "Policies, technology and Nigerian MSMEs\u2019 battle for survival in a pandemic",
          "text": "It would be pretty difficult to miss small stores on the streets of Nigeria, selling anything from cookware to clothing or electronics. In some buildings, you would find shops stacked to the roof with wares. The arrival of the pandemic seems to have changed the perspective of some small business owners.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment put the number of Nigerian MSMEs at 37 million and data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) shows that they account for 96% of businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThis sector has contributed up to 50% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the last five years and provides up to 80% of jobs in the country.\n\nThese numbers are not exclusive to Nigeria as the United Nations(UN) also records that MSMEs account for 90% of businesses across the globe, and provide 60-70% of employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite its importance, significant problems have been plaguing MSMEs in Nigeria. Though the country\u2019s government has been trying to implement relief policies and business incentives, few businesses can benefit, as most MSMEs are in the informal sector.\n\nFor context, these are businesses that are not registered or protected by government regulations. As these academic researchers found out, the actual size of Nigeria\u2019s informal economy is challenging to verify.\n\nThe NBS says the informal sector accounts for 99.8% of MSMEs, and only 10% were registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) \u2014 primarily as business names.\n\nPer academic researchers Roberto Dell\u2019Anno and Omobola Adu, Nigeria\u2019s employment uncertainties and rapid urban migration are responsible for the rise of informal businesses.\n\n(Un)foreseen side effects\n\nWhile the number of unregistered MSMEs might not seem like a big issue at first glance, a closer look reveals that such businesses could be missing significant fiscal benefits and escaping taxation.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Finance Act, for example, exempts businesses with an annual turnover of less than \u20a625 million ($61k) from paying income tax. On the other hand, a deep government mistrust seems to keep micro-businesses from formal registrations and paying taxes.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the pandemic created a lot more problems for MSMEs across the globe, and Nigerian business owners faced problems born from systemic and infrastructural challenges.\n\nPeter*, a small business owner running a logistics and haulage service in Lagos, Nigeria, explains that he started this business as a side hustle during his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGetting a job after service was not certain, so I had to focus on developing my business to make ends meet. Even after I got a job, I have kept running my business,\u201d Peter explains.\n\nPeter, who ardently follows business developments in the media, says none of the publicised government incentives has ever interested him. For him, the goal was to \u201chammer\u201d (hit it big with his business) while staying away from prying government eyes.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the pandemic and the lockdown that ensued changed Peter\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cI began to question my entire business model, and I kept wishing I could access the loans from the Central Bank I kept seeing on TV,\u201d he muses.\n\nRecall that the Central Bank of Nigeria earmarked a \u20a650 billion COVID-19 relief fund which it reportedly disbursed to qualified SMEs after some strange delays.\n\nWith government incentives treated with deep scepticism, some Nigerian businesses had to find ways to survive.\n\nThe struggle for survival\n\nIn an interview with Techpoint Africa, Ope Adeoye, CEO of Nigerian fintech, OnePipe, argued that a typical trader that leaves his home with \u20a6100 in his pocket would make all he needs for that day and eat it up on that same day.\n\nNigeria is touted by the World Bank as one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, with 40% (83 million people) living below the poverty line. The informal economy has been a major means for livelihood, but lockdown enforcement in the country\u2019s major cities in 2020 puts these livelihoods at risk.\n\nWorld Poverty clock shows Nigeria at the top of the global poverty chart in 2020\n\nThe outcome was pretty different for most people. Luckily enough, it was business as usual for some who sold essential goods and services like food and groceries. But it was not the same for others.\n\n\u201cFor weeks, we were indoors, wondering how long the food we had stocked would last before the lockdown was lifted,\u201d Efosa, a small-scale Lagos-based fashion designer, recounts. \u201cNaturally, clothes fell in the scale of preference for most people.\u201d\n\nDuring the partial lockdown, Efosa says his son helped him sell off his old printers on the classifieds marketplace, Jiji. He then realised that business was still going on, just not in traditional markets.\n\n\u201cI began to consume a lot of YouTube for ideas on how to improve my skills. I no longer had to get ideas for fashion styles I saw in the market. A lot of them were already online.\u201d\n\nBeing averse to going to government offices, Efosa eventually discovered that he could register his business online, an essential prerequisite for loans he was trying to access.\n\nCynthia, an artisan soap-maker based in Delta State, Nigeria, reveals that nothing much changed for her business during the lockdown. If anything, orders only increased.\n\n\u201cStill, I discovered I could be doing more with my business if I improved my online presence. I wanted it to be more than my WhatsApp status, you know,\u201d she says.\n\nPerhaps, the most drastic change we observed in our various interviews was Peter\u2019s logistics and haulage service.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, all I had was a business card, and people could only reach me via calls. After my reflection, I employed someone to help me create a website where people can just use the tools and filters there to place an order and get quotations,\u201d he explains.\n\nPeter\u2019s scope expanded to running ad campaigns on Google and Facebook and getting a feel of other established businesses running his line of work. As a first step, Peter registered his business name and built a team for his business.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m starting a different kind of business all over again, but I\u2019m excited at this new journey.\u201d\n\nAs for government incentives, neither Efosa, Cynthia, or Peter expressed much interest, but they unanimously agreed that several small businesses need as much government support as possible.\n\nCharting a way forward\n\nPhoto by Riccardo Annandale on Unsplash\n\nThe UN has designated today as World MSME day with the theme: \u201cMSMEs: Key to an inclusive and sustainable recovery\u201d. The UN posits that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and an economy that is greener and fairer requires resilient and flourishing MSMEs everywhere.\n\nPer the UN, pandemic recovery efforts are being presented as an opportunity to \u201crebuild better\u201d, particularly by prioritizing sustainability, resilience, and inclusiveness.\n\nSo far, the Nigerian government has primarily been in the news with talks of supporting businesses with relief funds, but this might not be the best approach.\n\n\u201cIt has to be beyond money and tax breaks. Issues with power, roads, security, and other harsh business conditions will likely soak up the money in a blink of an eye,\u201d says Efosa.\n\nHe also claims several people are still without access to information on how they can digitise their services, which could be a severe bottleneck to MSME-driven economic recovery.\n\nTo celebrate this day, we can all take a moment to appreciate the importance of these businesses and how difficult the pandemic has been for them.\n\n*The actual names of these business owners have been withheld upon request. You can reach out to us should you wish to contact any one of them.",

          "title": "How technology is helping this AC technician scale his business",
          "text": "Have you ever walked into a room and immediately started sweating bullets? Have you spent time in a room with air-conditioners that blow hot air?\n\nThen you would quite understand why I was happy when last year, after a lot of convincing and back and forth, my mom finally agreed to get two air-conditioners installed in the house. But, unfortunately, it gets incredibly hot in the dry season even though there are huge windows everywhere. So we contacted a former neighbour that sells used ACs, paid three-quarters of the money, and had him deliver them to the house.\n\nAfter the delivery and installation by Udoka, a very cheerful and outspoken \u201cAC installer\u201d, trouble started. The ACs were not cooling. Udoka was called back several times, the gas was filled and refilled, one split AC exchanged for a standing one, a total of four technicians worked on the cooling units, one AC unit almost caught on fire.\n\nSeveral months later, my parents had spent more than \u20a6250,000 ($524.1)* on ACs that never worked. They are still in the house, an immutable reminder of wasted money and time, and perhaps, another reason to be continually disappointed in Nigerian artisans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s why when we were asked to pitch possible stories for an article, the event \u201cWorld Refrigeration Day\u201d caught my attention. I was increasingly interested when I saw that this year\u2019s theme was \u201cCooling Champions: Cool Careers for a Better World.\u201d\n\nI was immediately transported back to the emotions I felt during the AC installation and repair saga. But, rather than focus on my frustrations, I began to ask questions. What would it take to start a career in the refrigeration industry? How much would it cost? What kind of tools and technology make the work easier?\n\nWorld Refrigeration Day\n\nSince 2019, World Refrigeration Day is celebrated every June 26. It is an international awareness campaign established by the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat to raise the profile of the refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump sector. It focuses on the significant role that the industry and its technology play in modern life and society.\n\nIt was the idea of refrigeration consultant, Stephen Gill, former President of the Institute of Refrigeration in the UK. It quickly caught on in its first year, with more than 800 physical events held in 153 countries around the globe.\n\nAccording to the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat, more than 15 million people are employed worldwide in the refrigeration sector, while the total number of refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump systems in operation worldwide is around 5 billion.\n\nQuite impressive statistics, but I was curious about how much of it Nigeria\u2019s economy accounts for, especially for the average AC or refrigerator technician.\n\nI spent some time with Emmanuel to try to answer this, and you\u2019ll find details below.\n\nThe learning process\n\nEmmanuel of Ipese Oluwa Technologies\n\nEmmanuel is an AC technician who runs Ipese Oluwa Technologies, a business in the student town of Ile-Ife, Osun State. The young entrepreneur graduated from the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, as a physicist in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like many OAU alumni before him, he saw a problem and decided to solve it. Before leaving school, he was already working as a cable TV installer. However, customers began to ask if he could repair ACs. Seeing the business opportunity, he decided to learn.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has 78 approved and accredited Vocational Enterprises Institutions (VEIs), with the latest getting approval in 2019. However, only two teach Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Practice, with a two or three-year study option. Some of these institutions give scholarships in conjunction with partners, but the rest require payment.\n\nInterestingly, Emmanuel didn\u2019t go down this route. Instead, he chose to learn from technicians in Ile-Ife and Benin City, Edo State. In 2014, he undertook the course for one and a half years and paid roughly \u20a6170,000 ($1062.5)** to learn but claims to have understood the basics in two weeks.\n\nApart from the traditional training, Emmanuel uses YouTube and Google as additional learning tools. For him, they are even more helpful than the conventional training.\n\n\u201cI learn so many things. I watch clips with different styles. It is very helpful,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter watching several hours of AC installation and work tools videos on YouTube myself, I am inclined to agree. But, interestingly, Nigerians are yet to join the DIY video trend.\n\nTools of the trade\n\nSource: United National Environment Programme (UNEP)\n\nAn AC technician requires several important tools to get his work done \u2014 wrenches, pipe bending tools, manifold gauge, pliers, a pen and paper, protective equipment, and so on.\n\nFor Emmanuel, though, certain tools that would make his work easier include a vacuum pump, a drill and a Hi-Lift Jack. A vacuum pump is an essential tool used to repair cooling units to clean the compressor by removing unwanted air and water vapour.\n\nA drill is used to puncture the wall for the AC\u2019s pipes and wall brackets. A handheld drill would be a step up from the chisel and hammer Emmanuel currently uses. The videos I watched showed how technicians use it to create very clean-cut holes \u2014 a far cry from the ragged holes crude tools form.\n\nThis is important because, apart from aesthetics, you don\u2019t want air leaking out from spaces in the room.\n\nWhen it comes to quotes, he gives prices based on the type of building where the cooling unit is to be installed. This is because it takes a lot of effort to move the AC up the house using a ladder, a situation that can be avoided by using a lift that guarantees a safe and hassle-free operation.\n\nAll of these cost quite a bit of money. But these are not the only tools Emmanuel employs.\n\nLeveraging the Internet\n\nThe AC technician reveals that he uses websites like Jiji and Facebook for advertising his products and services.\n\nAccording to him, he has received referrals from those ads.\n\nI find this quite interesting because while searching Google for a cooling technician in the Ile-Ife area, his was the only name that immediately came up. Others were located in Osogbo (1 hour 22 minutes away), Ibadan (1 hour 29 minutes away), and Lagos (3 hours 53 minutes away).\n\nI would later to find others, but that involved a search on Instagram, Google, Olist and Facebook.\n\nAir-conditioning units\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nInevitably, our discussion veered into types of ACs, the most popular, and the best ones to use.\n\nIn Nigeria, the climate is tropical, semi-arid in the far north, and progressively rainier as you move southward. In the north, the temperatures become extreme depending on the season. When it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s scorching. When it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing.\n\nThe south has more temperate weather, but the country is quite hot. A fact most Nigerians can attest to.\n\nPresently, the market for single-split air-conditioners in Nigeria is set at approximately 560,000 units annually. LG leads the pack with an 11% market share, Samsung has 9%, Panasonic and Midea have 8%, Gree and Chigo have 7%, Daikin 5%, while Haier Thermocool and Hisense have 3%. The remaining market share belongs to lesser-known brands like Royal.\n\n86% of these cooling units are assembled in the country, with 14% of them imported. This is because, unlike the automotive sector, for example, Nigeria encourages local assembly of the cooling units by setting a lower import duty (5%) for completely knocked down units, compared to assembled units (20%)\n\nEmmanuel says most customers prefer to buy new units with brands like Hisense, Royal, and Midea as the most patronised due to their relative cheapness. Prices range from the \u20a6100,000s ($243.01) to the \u20a6500,000s ($1215.07). However, he resisted my pressure and declined to name the best brand.\n\n\u201cWhat might be my best might be different for you,\u201d he said.\n\nI certainly wished we had decided to buy new ACs right then.\n\nCool careers for a better world\n\nAccording to Numbeo, the average monthly net salary in Nigeria is \u20a671,945.53 ($174.84).\n\nWhen asked if he would be willing to switch jobs, Emmanuel said no. According to him, he earns more money working as an artisan than most salary earners. So in one sitting, he could make more than most people.\n\nMoney aside, he views his work with enthusiasm. His eagerness to answer questions and willingness to learn things that he previously did not know, and his dedication to attempting his best work, all shine through as we converse.\n\nHappy World Refrigeration Day as we all take a moment to appreciate the cooling technicians who keep our homes and work areas cool and serene enough for comfortable living.\n\nWe should also appreciate the man who invented the modern air-conditioner, Willis Carrier.\n\n*Black market rates, December 2020\n\n**Dollar equivalent in 2014",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain.

          "title": "INTERVIEW: I\u2019ll shift APC from ruling party to governing party if elected \u2013 Chairmanship Aspirant",
          "text": "Ibrahim Baba, special adviser to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and former member of the House, recently spoke to PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 Samson Adenekan and Nasir Ayitogo on his plan to contest the position of the national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Excerpts:\n\nPT: We learnt that you are vying for the seat of APC National Chairman; what is your mission? Considering the calibre of people that have shown interest in that same seat; we have former governors, serving senators, among others, do you think you can match them or fit for this seat?\n\nBaba: My mission is to reposition the party from a ruling party to a governing party to achieve the manifesto we presented to the people in 2015.\n\nI think if you use the word matching, you are not even fair to them. We are all in a political arena and everybody will come out to explore and explain himself to reach where he wants to reach. The most important thing is how you\u2019re able to convince the party faithful to believe in you and your mission.\n\nAs I said earlier, I want to reposition the party. We have a manifesto of 2015 and the president has tried to achieve so many things in the area of security and infrastructure and we want the party leaders coming into executive and legislative positions to key 100 per cent into the mission and promises we made to Nigerian people before they elected us in 2015.\n\nPT: You made mention of shifting the party from ruling to governing as your mission. Are you saying the previous APC leadership has not done well?\n\nAnswer: Well, everybody can be a ruler but to have good governance is another thing. What I mean by governing instead of ruling is to govern people the way they want and the best way to define this is in results not by just sitting on the seat doing nothing.\n\nLike they say, democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people. A government that is not people-centred is not really a government.\n\nPT: If you are given the opportunity to sit on that seat, what are the things you will do differently?\n\nAnswer: You see, selecting candidates for party primaries is the key and the most important aspect of any political party. So, I will give equal opportunity to all members to vie for all vacant political offices.\n\nPT: Almost every aspirant vying for that seat has always assured members that there will be a level playing ground for all. Don\u2019t you think this statement has been over flogged?\n\nAnswer: Sometimes people will say it without meaning it, that is why I said we want to be a governing party, not ruling. We have laid down rules and procedures and we are going to follow it to the letter. In every situation, we have crops of procedures to be able to achieve or reach where we want to reach. So, we will follow that process.\n\nPT: Your name was penned down in 2020 as the National Secretary of the party but you did not eventually get the seat. What went wrong?\n\nAnswer: Well, I cannot divulge what went wrong but you know that it was a decision of the party and the presidency that time to give me that opportunity but something happened along the line.\n\nFor me, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what happened but the position was taken.\n\nPT: The party has concluded its registration and there are complaints from some corners about the exercise. Was it fair on your members in Bauchi?\n\nAnswer: In my state, it was fair enough. Everyone was given the opportunity to register but there were issues in some states like Kano, Kwara and some other states, although the National Headquarters has made some moves to calm nerves in those states.\n\nPT: Party administration is new to you and could be quite overwhelming. How do you intend to overcome this?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnswer: I can\u2019t say it is new to me because I have been a partisan politician since 2003 and I have passed through a lot of processes as a party member. In 2008, I contested for the chairmanship of my local government in ANPP and in 2011 I contested for the House of Representatives in the CPC and I have gone through a lot of other processes to get to this level of public service.\n\nPT: Which bloc in your party are you banking on to win this race? Do you have the backing of your state chapter?\n\nAnswer: I am banking on all the delegates, I don\u2019t want to say this particular bloc and you know I am coming from a particular constituency.\n\nI am not only banking on my state chapter I have also met with almost two-third of all the state executives in Nigeria. So far so good.\n\nPT: Do you think your former colleagues in the National Assembly will play a significant role in your emergence, knowing well that at least two of the Senate President\u2019s colleagues are in this race?\n\nAnswer: Yes of course. Not only my former colleagues, even the current National Assembly, the Senate president, speakers. We have met, we have discussed.\n\nI am not saying the Senate President will abandon two of his colleagues in the race. All I am saying is that I am also a member of that constituency and you are being treated equally. I am hoping I will have the backing of all members of the Assembly.\n\nPT: For you to be vying for the national seat of the party and you are from the north, do you believe in the zoning of the presidential ticket to the southern part? Is there any written arrangement to that effect?\n\nAnswer: As a democrat, you give equal opportunity to all but once you have some internal arrangements, you should abide by those arrangements.\n\nThough there is no written arrangement to that effect to the best of my knowledge, but you know once you have an association, even your body language should tell you the right thing to do.\n\nI am not saying zoning it to the southern part is right or wrong. All I am saying is that we are giving equal opportunity to all. Once we reach there, we are going to cross that bridge.\n\nPT: You just spoke about body language, unwritten arrangement of zoning, but from the look of things, it seems the race for the APC national chairmanship seat is all a northern affair. Why are there no southern aspirants?\n\nAnswer: I think there is a fellow from Edo (referring to Sunny Moniedafe). I also think this race is a matter of interest and it is open to everybody. As I told you, the party is going to be fair to all.\n\nPT: How would you rate the leadership of former chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and the Mala Buni-led interim leadership?\n\nAnswer: You know that leadership comes with its own challenges. The time when Oshiomhole was there, it was a critical time. It was a time for selecting candidates to fill different political offices. And the current period is a governance period, not a period for selecting candidates per say. But as you can see there are so many changes coming up, so many new people coming into the party because reconciliation is going on seriously.\n\nWe are going to continue with that.\n\nIn the last two years, the party has made a lot of progress considering the recent influx of former members who defected and are now coming back, even governors from the PDP.\n\nPT: Aside from that, can you rate the performance of your party in government?\n\nAnswer: As I said earlier, when you have an association, it has its rules and if anybody violates the rules, the person should be punished. If anybody supports the party to reach where it is today, the person should be compensated adequately.\n\nWe have so many positions in governance that are idle and we have party faithful that are sitting home idle, people who contested and lost elections but have helped the party to attain its current status. By the grace of God, if we come on board, we are going to convince the president to fill those vacancies.\n\nPT: Back to your home state, Bauchi, what is the atmosphere like between the APC and PDP considering the fact that an incumbent governor from your party was defeated by the main opposition?\n\nAnswer: We have so many issues in Bauchi. There were so many anti-party activities by our members which led to the emergence of the current government but at the end of it all most of the former members, like the former speaker of the House of Representatives (Yakubu Dogara), have seen the light and have come back home. We have hope that we are going to reclaim that seat in the coming election.\n\nPT: Bauchi State has one of the most enlightened voters in the country, do you think the current state administration is doing well to get re-elected?\n\nAnswer: They will vote the governor out. Last week, the president approved the site of another federal university in the state and in the last three months, he approved the location of a federal college of education in the same state.\n\nThese are enough grounds to reclaim our seat and the governor is not doing much in terms of social responsibility. He has not been paying salaries, pension and gratuities as at and when due. In infrastructure, only roads are being built and abandoning critical infrastructure in healthcare and education, water, sanitation etc.\n\nPT: In other words, you are giving the governor a pass mark in road construction?\n\nAnswer: Well, you can\u2019t take that from him but when you talk about health, water and sanitation, you can write zero for him there.",
          "summary": "Excerpts:PT: We learnt that you are vying for the seat of APC National Chairman; what is your mission?\nBaba: My mission is to reposition the party from a ruling party to a governing party to achieve the manifesto we presented to the people in 2015.\nPT: You made mention of shifting the party from ruling to governing as your mission.\nAnswer: You see, selecting candidates for party primaries is the key and the most important aspect of any political party.\nAnswer: Sometimes people will say it without meaning it, that is why I said we want to be a governing party, not ruling.",

          "title": "Dangote Makes Nigeria Third-Highest Country in Terms of Urea Capacity Additions",
          "text": "By JOHN MOMODU\n\nWith the coming on stream of Dangote Fertiliser Limited, global urea capacity is poised to see considerable growth over the upcoming years, potentially increasing from 222.96 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 2020 to 305.92 mtpa in 2030, registering a total growth of 37%, according to a GlobalData report.\n\nThe 3.0 million metric tonnes of Dangote Fertiliser plant and around 88 planned and announced plants are scheduled to come online, predominantly in Asia and Africa, over the next five years.\n\nGlobalData, which made this announcement in its Global Urea Capacity Additions by 2030, released recently, hinted that the completion of Dangote Fertiliser has made Nigeria the third-highest country in terms of capacity additions, with a capacity of 11.58 million tpy by 2030. \u201cMajor capacity additions will be from two planned plants Dangote Group Lekki Urea Plant 1 and Dangote Group Lekki Urea Plant 2 with a capacity of 1.50 million tpy each by 2030,\u201d it added.\n\nDangote Fertiliser plant has however placed Nigeria in the third position among other countries, like Iran and India that will lead in global urea capacity growth by 2030.\n\nThe report classified Dangote Industries Limited, Nagarjuna Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited and Fertiliser Corporation of India Limited as the top three companies globally in terms of planned capacity addition to global urea production by 2030.\n\nDangote Industries Limited has completed the largest fertiliser Plant in West Africa.

          "text": "Strong indication emerged Sunday that Zamfara state Governor Bello Matawalle will defect from Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe planned defection was announced barely 46 days after Cross River state Governor Ben Ayade dumped the opposition party for the governing APC, a development that generated heated reactions from some PDP chieftains.\n\nEbonyi state Governor Dave Umahi left the party last year while a PDP lawmaker, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi also joined the APC last week.\n\nMatawalle\n\nAnnouncing the governor\u2019s plan in a statement obtained by Blueprint in Abuja, a former Commissioner for Rural Development and Cooperatives in the state, Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi Tsafe, said the governor had heeded the call made to that effect.\n\nTsafe, an APC chieftain in the state, was the first to call on Matawalle to join APC March last year.\n\nHe was one of the APC chieftains in the cabinet of Matawalle until it was dissolved early this month.\n\nTsafe said he was condemned and called names by PDP chieftains when he first called on the governor to join APC.\n\n\u201cWhen as a member of his cabinet, I was appealing to the governor to join the APC, a lot of people expressed reservations but to the glory of Allah, he has accepted to join. The governor ignored all calls by the PDP chieftains against me.\n\n\u201cAll arrangements have been concluded for the governor to join APC. We will formally receive him on Tuesday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former commissioner also said with Matawalle in APC, the welfare of the people of the state would be adequately attended to as the federal government would give necessary attention to the state.\n\n\u201cWith him in the APC, the success we are recording in the area of insecurity would be consolidated. We will fully have opportunities to harness the abundant mineral resources in the state for the benefit of our people.\n\n\u201cAs the next door neighbour of Mr. President\u2019s state, Katsina, Zamfara will be better in the ruling party. Welcome onboard Your Excellency, \u201cTsafe said.\n\nZMSG confirms\n\nAnd in line with Tsafe\u2019s declaration, the state Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, formally announced the defection plan in a public service announcement on Zamfara state radio and television stations.\n\nDosara announced this Sunday in his capacity as the chairman publicity committee of the defection programme scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nPDP excos, ex-minister, others join\n\nMeanwhile, investigation by one of our correspondents revealed that both the state PDP executives, led by Alhaji Tukur Danfulani, the three senators representing Zamfara North, West and Central, Senator Sahabi Ya\u2019u, Senator Hassan Muhammed Nasiha and Senator Hassan Dan\u2019iya respectively, and some six members of the House of Representatives have unanimously backed Governor Matawalle\u2019s defection to the ruling party.\n\nAlso set to go with the governor are former deputy governor, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala and former Minister of Interior, Ambassador Bashir Yuguda.\n\nHowever, the Seventh House of Representatives member representing Talata Mafara Federal Constituency, Kabir Classic, is not joining the defectors as revealed by him to an online medium-thunder blower\n\nSimilarly, Deputy Governor Mahadi Aliyu Gusau, it was gathered, said he had not yet decided on whether to follow the governor.\n\nThe deputy governor, who is the son of a top former military brass, General Aliyu Gusau, is being rumoured to have pledged remaining in the PDP, a party his father belongs.\n\nSecondus must go, PDP youth insist\n\nAnd from the PDP South-South Youths Vanguard came a call Sunday that the party\u2019s national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus must be kicked out.\n\nThe call is coming on the heel of frequent defection of the opposition party strong members, especially governors, to the ruling APC.\n\nThe PDP youths, under the aegis of South-South Youth Vanguard, called on the party leaders to stop the drift of defection and address the negative situation in the party now.\n\nThe youth vanguard, in a statement by its national chairman, James Efe Akpofure, said the party would be empty before Secondus leaves office by December if he\u2019s not sacked now.\n\n\u201cIf the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) is doing well, this exodus of party members to APC will not be experienced,\u201d the youth said.\n\nThey further said \u201cthe continued stay of Secondus as the party National Chairman will destroy the party if not quickly checked.\n\n\u201cIt is embarrassing that within the space of few months, members with key positions are leaving the party.

          "title": "Insecurity in FCT: UniAbuja, Veritas varsity, COED Zuba, 5 others on red alert",
          "text": "Tertiary institutions within and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja are on red alert following escalating incidences of kidnapping in higher institutions across the country in recent times.\n\nWithin the last two months, some tertiary institutions in Kaduna, Niger, Benue, Kebbi and Abia states were attacked and students taken captives for ransom, thereby heightening tension about the safety of students in higher institutions across the country.\n\nThe FCT Police Command had in May, directed the nine public and privately owned universities, polytechnic and college of education located in and around the territory to reduce their academic activities to a \u2018minimal level\u2019 to forestall inadvertently and unduly exposing their students and staff to present danger of kidnapping by insurgents and bandits.\n\nThe directive followed unusual movements of persons suspected to have banditry profiling into the FCT as well as claims that insurgents were occupying Shiroro town and villages around its vicinity in Niger state.\n\nThe alleged occupied places are about two hours drive to Abuja metropolis and the respective area councils, as recently stated by Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nTertiary institutions in Abuja\n\nThe FCT plays host to eight public and privately owned higher institutions, including six universities, a polytechnic and college of education namely: University of Abuja, Nile University, Baze University, Veritas University, Dubem Polytechnic, College of Education Zuba, Philomath University Kuje, African University of Science and Technology Abuja (yet to take off) and Bingham University in Karu, Nasarawa state with very close proximity to the FCT.\n\nTertiary institutions meet security agencies\n\nAccordingly, the police authorities held series of meetings with respective higher institutions\u2019 management highlighting the present danger as well as taking precautionary measures aimed at averting such danger in future.\n\nBeyond holding meetings at the level of the FCT Police Command, the tertiary institutions\u2019 managements equally held security meetings with their respective Divisional Police Officers in the six area councils where further precautionary measures were suggested and modalities for implementation put in place.\n\nIn one of such meetings between the Zuba DPO and the College of Education, Zuba held Thursday, June 17th, 2021, the school management was directed to increase the presence of plainclothes security operatives in and around their facilities and to ensure both students and visitors were properly profiled but without attracting attention.\n\nSpeaking on the development, a senior management staff of the college, who, for administrative purpose, spoke under anonymity said: \u201cYes, we were directed by the police authorities in the FCT Command to step up security presence in our facilities because of the escalating incidences of kidnapping in tertiary institutions in the country.\n\n\u201cIn fact, just yesterday (Thursday, June 17th, 2021) we were in a meeting with the DPO of Zuba where we discussed issues of security of the school and its environs and it was resolved that security be stepped up to reflect the current situation.\n\n\u201cEven before the directive, our security arrangement has always been intact. We have the presence of operatives of the Directorate of State Security Service in and around the school. They are there to monitor and assist us coordinate security activities within the school because of our huge students\u2019 population and staff. We are always conscious of security, especially following the escalating cases of kidnapping for ransom of tertiary institutions\u2019 students in the country in recent time,\n\n\u201cBefore now, we had taken solid measures to tighten security around our facilities and the students\u2019 population and we are not about to slack. Instead, in response to the current threat, we are ever more determined to further strengthen our presence and boost security consciousness among students and staff.\u201d\n\nUniAbuja\n\nSimilarly, the University of Abuja Head of Information Department, Dr Habib Yakoob, said the school, in conjunction with the police authorities, has adopted measures to further tighten security within and around the permanent site of the university located along the Airport Road.\n\n\u201cAs you can see in the school, students are going about their normal businesses without tension, there is calm because there is reasonable security. We are on our toes, very alert and monitoring situation.\n\n\u201cThis university is a federal government entity so we are not in charge of the police nor any official security agencies but what we have done is to have our internal security mechanism that we hope can contain any security issues.\n\n\u201cOur security personnel have the capacity to carry out surveillance to ensure the safety of our students. Besides, they are working in conjunction with the federal government security agencies, particularly the police, in case we have a threat,\u201d Yakoob said.\n\nVeritas University\n\nAt Veritas University, a privately owned institution, the institution scaled down academic activities, including vacating the students on campus.\n\nThis was stated by the institution\u2019s Vice Chancellor, Professor Hyacinth Ichuko.\n\n\u201cWe are a residential university and over time, we have been very conscious of the security of our staff and students. We have had to build a police station in front of the university at the buffer zone of the university and they (police) are gracious enough to send 14 police officers there. Still that does not stop our internal security efforts. We have beefed up our own internal security in terms of use of no-armed bearing security operatives,\u201d Ichuko said while featuring on a recent television programme.\n\nNotwithstanding the various security arrangements put in place by the various authorities, Professor Ichuko called for increased military presence in schools as well as collaborative efforts among the higher institutions and parents as well as the security agencies.\n\nThis, he said, would not only ensure the institutions are protected but would also wade off the threat of kidnapping and banditry-related vices and make it almost impossible in the FCT higher institutions.\n\nPerimeter fence\n\nThough each of these schools occupies large expanse of land, very few of them have protective perimeter fence which could stall encroachment by unwanted elements.\n\nFor instance, University of Abuja has almost 12,000 hectares of land at its permanent site along Airport Road, but less than 5,000 hectares enjoy perimeter fence with almost the long stretch of land comprising of hills and rocks and thick bushes behind its perimeter yet to be fenced.\n\nSpeaking on this, spokesman of the university, Dr. Yakoob said: \u201cWell our perimeter fence, in all modesty, covers a relatively large portion of the university and work is still ongoing. But the university is not only relying on the perimeter fence. We have reasonably adequate security and we are working in conjunction with other security forces and we also have a mechanism if there is any threat to our security.\u201d\n\nAlso, Veritas University said it\u2019s doing its best to provide a secure environment for both students and staff, stressing that the security buffer zone created was for that purpose.\n\n\u201cWe also want to create a security buffer around the university and we have gone out of our way to support the vigilante groups around the communities,\u201d Ichuko explained.\n\nBut the situation at the College of Education, Zuba is almost similar to the UniAbuja as the school\u2019s permanent site is entirely without front and back perimeter fence.\n\n\u201cWe have perimeter fence around the temporary site and also around the permanent site,\u201d a senior staff insisted.\n\nHowever, our correspondent observed that though it (COE Zuba) occupies several acres of land, but apart from the unused main entrance, perimeter fence is nonexistent leaving the school completely exposed.\n\nThe sprawling permanent site consisting of about three acres of land is a beehive of construction activities with herders and farmers competing for portions of the land.\n\nThe same is applicable to Baze University where a makeshift security presence is at the entrance with a reflexive mirror used to check the under of cars while pedestrians could walk almost with minimum hassles. From behind it shares a boundary with the thick bush adjacent to the CCECC, International Cancer Centre along the Lugbe Expressway but with a near nonexistent perimeter fence.\n\nStudents raise concern\n\nStudents of Veritas varsity, Baze varsity, UniAbuja and others all lamented the lack of protection which perimeter fence could have offered them and pleaded with the federal government to prevail on their respective school managements to construct perimeter fence to provide a measure of safeguard against intruders into their schools.\n\nA final year student at Veritas University Bwari, \u2018May\u2019 Danjuma, said since they were asked to vacate their hostels sometime April, most students had been anxious to complete their programmes.\n\n\u201cWe have been eager to get over with our programmes because the tension is palpable. In fact, none would want to experience the ordeal the kidnapped students of Greenfield University got in the hands of kidnappers. I can\u2019t imagine being subjected to any ordeal in the hands of kidnappers or insurgents. Most students would gladly welcome the presence of the military in our school pending when the situation normalizes,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the Faculty of Arts (English Language) University of Abuja, who simply identified himself as Theo, lamented the insecurity around the school.\n\nTheo said: \u201cThe tension generated by insecurity around schools is worsened by lack of adequate presence of security operatives. Besides, we, in the Faculty of Arts, are not safe at all because the school is seriously exposed without the perimeter fence at the stretch of land that constitutes the back of the school. You can see rocky hills, columns of thick bushes all around, herders stray in at will and you don\u2019t know who is who. The school is vulnerable without the protective perimeter fence. We need improved deployment of the police and other armed security outfits.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Ismail Musa, said: \u201cThe federal government needs to step up security presence in schools in the FCT particularly tertiary institutions which seem to be the focus of attacks by unknown gunmen or kidnappers. Whatever internal arrangements the schools have made is not enough to guarantee reasonable security.\u201d\n\nExpressing similar worry, Bobby Frank,a student of College of Education Zuba said: \u201cInsecurity has become the sad reality of our society and it has induced tension, particularly in schools which are gradually becoming the epicentre for kidnappers. Well, while we count on God, we hope the government will beef up security around school facilities not only in the COE, Zuba but everywhere as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurgents and kidnappers I think are working together firstly to create tension and then scare away students from school. If the government does not want education in the country destroyed, now is the time to act decisively against these unwanted elements in the society. Besides, tightening security in schools, it is high time the government arrested, prosecuted and jailed kidnappers and insurgents to tame the tide of invasion of schools and kidnapping of Nigeria\u2019s future leaders,\u201d said another student, Muradi Bulama.\n\nAt the Philomath University, Kuje which is set to resume academic activities September, communities around the institution urged the authority to tighten security around the facility because of its vulnerability to attacks from \u201cdebased elements.\u201d\n\nExpert says there\u2019s reason to worry\n\nCommenting on the development, a security expert, retired Captain Aliyu Umar Babangida and CEO Coldwater and Riversand Consult, in a recent television programme, shared the concern of the students.\n\nThe ex-military intelligence officer said: \u201cIn virtually all the regions, we have a very heightened state of fear due to insecurity. It is not surprising that people who have seen nomads moving cows from one place to another have become worried.\n\n\u201cThe tension is further heightened because a certain group of people and their activities have become synonymous to insecurity because the situation itself was not managed properly a initio. Certain men did not manage these kidnappers and herdsmen\u2019s security issues properly and today one has become synonymous to the other.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cAs you can see in the school, students are going about their normal businesses without tension, there is calm because there is reasonable security.\nVeritas UniversityAt Veritas University, a privately owned institution, the institution scaled down academic activities, including vacating the students on campus.\nBut the situation at the College of Education, Zuba is almost similar to the UniAbuja as the school\u2019s permanent site is entirely without front and back perimeter fence.\n\u201cWe have perimeter fence around the temporary site and also around the permanent site,\u201d a senior staff insisted.\nFrom behind it shares a boundary with the thick bush adjacent to the CCECC, International Cancer Centre along the Lugbe Expressway but with a near nonexistent perimeter fence.",

Hon. Abubakar Suleiman, at Government House, Asaba.\n\nHe stated that as states\u2019 legislatures, the onus was on them to pass the Constitutional amendments in the interest of the nation.\n\nHe said that the nation was in dire need of the amendments to provide equity, justice and fairness in the affairs of the country.\n\nOkowa urged the Conference to continue to be a voice for the people and to remain true in enforcing executive-legislative relations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that the National Assembly is currently engaged in the review of the 1999 Constitution and when they are through, it will be passed over to the States\u2019 Assemblies for passage.\n\n\u201cThe management of the country has placed a key role in your hands and I urge you all to look at it passionately to ensure that we are fair, equitable and justiciable in all decisions we will take in passing the ammendment.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble but I believe that in working together, we can pilot the nation out of the current challenges through a passionate approach because as leaders, everything about governance must be in the overall interest of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the legislature in Delta for its cooperation which had led to the achievements recorded by his administration in the last six years.\n\nAccording to him, whatever we have achieved as a state so far is because we have a very robust relationship with the State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThey are very passionate about the development of the state and that has helped us to make lots of progress.\n\n\u201cI am glad that you have organised yourselves under the Conference to compare notes, just as the Governors, to discuss and share ideas and to also talk to ourselves because it helps to improve the bond of unity among the various states.\n\n\u201cThe more we are talking together and remain strong the better for our country and I believe that was why the Conference of Speakers was berthed and I hope that you will continue to use the conference to better the lots of this nation,\u201d he added.\n\nOkowa who underscored the importance of executive-legislative relations, said \u201cif any state is to make progress there is need for a very warm relationship with the executive and legislative arms to enable policies and programmes work more efficiently than they would have ordinarily had.\n\n\u201cWe are in very trying times and this poses more burden on the various state legislatures. There must be a lot of collaborations and thinking to get the states out of unemployment, poverty and insecurity pervading the nation.\n\n\u201cA very cordial relationship that works will help to improve on the development of our country.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, you have a lot of role to play and I charge you to see yourselves going beyond just making laws, to help the executive to ensure that the people get the best of governance.\n\n\u201cThe fear of legislative autonomy is unfounded because our state House of Assembly has been operating in autonomy since 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Rt.

Suleiman had said that the Speakers were in the state for the second quarter meeting of the Conference.\n\nHe said that the Conference was made up of Speakers of the 36 States Houses of Assembly representing the 998 members of Houses of Assembly in the country.\n\nHe commended the Governor for the massive development in Asaba and parts of the state, adding that the mutual understanding between the Executive and Legislative arms of government in the state was commendable and worthy of emulation.\n\nSpeaker of Delta House of Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, Rt Hon.

Some people don\u2019t like saying family planning, but whatever you do, you must manage your population to the benefit of all that is living within your nation,\u201d Obasanjo stated.\n\nWhile fielding questions from the students on mentorship, the former president highlighted service to the fatherland, integrity, loyalty, and good moral standing as some of the virtues that could sustain them in their varied career paths.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the threat issued by the Niger Delta Avengers on Saturday is rather unnecessary.\n\nThe special adviser to the president on media and publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement, quoted Buhari as saying that all issues raised by the group were already responded to when the president met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the presidential villa on Thursday.\n\nMr. Adesina said when the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress visited the president, issues such as the call for restructuring and the inauguration of a board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) were addressed.\n\nHe quotes the president saying \u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the niger delta and as you are aware the hydrocarbon pollution remediation project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the minister of environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities\u201d\n\nThe militant group, in a statement on Saturday, had announced the launch of \u2018operation humble\u2019, a new mission to resume attacks in the oil-rich region.\n\nThey said the south-south remains the most underdeveloped region in the country, with their needs and interests \u201cundermined by the failed Nigerian State\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: How FG Will Tax Profits Made By Global Tech Giants In Nigeria \u2013 Osinbajo\n\nBelow is a statement from the President on Sunday signed by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cThe media was on Sunday awash with threats and demands by the group to embark on economic sabotage through the bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including the development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\u201d\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is the full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any saber-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people-oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten-point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for the creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, as you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid-down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\u201d",

          "title": "How FG Will Tax Profits Made By Global Tech Giants In Nigeria \u2013 Osinbajo",
          "text": "Nigeria is set to utilise its legal provisions that empower the Federal Government to collect taxes on profits made in the country by global technology and digital firms not based in the country, but with a significant economic presence here.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, (SAN) made this known on Friday, while interacting with a delegation of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), led by its President, Mr Adesina Adedayo who visited him at the Presidential Villa.\n\nWhile noting that the Federal Government will not be raising tax rates at this time, based on the Finance Act 2019, the Vice President said it is already empowered to widen the tax net, including through the collection of taxes on the Nigerian income of global tech giants with significant economic presence here, even if they have not established an office or permanent establishment and are currently not paying taxes in Nigeria.\n\nIn this regard, Section 4 of the Finance Act 2019, provides that \u201cthe Minister (Finance) may by order (of the President) determine what constitutes the significant economic presence of a company other than a Nigerian company,\u201d the VP said.\n\nRead Also: Twitter Gave IPOB Platform To Promote Violence, Lai Mohammed Tells Reps\n\nAccording to Prof. Osinbajo, \u201cwe have had severe economic downturns which of course implies that we may not be able to collect taxes with the aggressiveness that would ordinarily be expected.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we must widen our tax net so that more people who are eligible to pay tax are paying. Several efforts have been made, and I am sure you are aware of the initiatives including the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) which was also an attempt to bring more people into the tax net, including those who have foreign assets.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the VP said: \u201cwe have also recently taken a step with respect to a lot of the technology companies that are not represented here but who do huge volumes of business here.\n\n\u201cThe Finance Act has shown that we are very prepared to ensure that these big technology companies do not escape without paying their fair share of taxation in Nigeria. Many of them do incredible volumes here in Nigeria and in several other parts of the region.\n\n\u201cWe have drawn up the regulations and we are prepared to go, and I think that we are at least in a good place to tap into some of the tax resources we can get from some of these companies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, besides the FG, a recent Bloomberg news article reported that \u201cgovernments around the world are grappling with how to modernize their legal frameworks to account for the global reach of the digital economy, reshaping how policymakers think about issues as varied as monopoly power, taxation and workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nAlso, international talks are currently ongoing in Paris on global standard rules for governments to receive taxes from such digital and technology firms with significant economic presence in foreign countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, according to the Finance Act 2019, a company will pay taxes if it \u201ctransmits, emits or receives signals, sounds, messages, images or data of any kind by cable, radio, electromagnetic systems, or any other electronic or wireless apparatus to Nigeria in respect of any activity, including electronic commerce, application store, high-frequency trading, electronic data storage, online adverts, participative network platform, online payments and so on, to the extent that the company has significant economic presence in Nigeria and profit can be attributable to such activity.\n\n\u201cIf the trade or business comprises the furnishing of technical, management, consultancy or professional services outside of Nigeria to a person resident in Nigeria to the extent that the company has significant economic presence in Nigeria\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Prof. Osinbajo noted that while the Federal Government has no plans to raise taxes now, there are those who argue that \u201cour tax rates are too low, comparing us to other places in the region where the rates are much higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have had to balance all of these issues because clearly, higher tax rates can be a disincentive to businesses and investments. In terms of domestic resource mobilization, we are trying to do the best we can, given the present circumstances and I believe that there is room for improvement.\u201d\n\nActually, under the Finance Act 2019, the Buhari administration has reduced taxes for small companies \u2013 companies with less than N25 million in annual turnover are charged Zero Company Income Tax, CIT. Also CIT for companies with revenues between N25 and N100m (described in the Act as \u201cmedium-sized\u201d companies) has been reduced from 30% to 20%. Besides, Nigerians making minimum wage income are not to pay tax at all.\n\nUnder the 2020 Finance Act there is also an exemption of small companies from payment of education tax under the Tertiary Education Trust fund (TETFUND)-meaning companies with less than N25m turnover are eligible\n\nSimilarly, there is a 50% per cent reduction in minimum tax; from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent for gross turnover for financial years ending between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2021\n\nWelcoming the delegation, the Vice President emphasized the need for regular interaction between the council and government to address issues bothering on tax legislation, noting that \u201cthere is need for continuous engagement with the National Assembly because engagement with government cannot be a one-off thing.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo added that the Federal Government has over the past few years, initiated programmes aimed at improving the growth of small businesses including the formalization of many of them. Under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), there is a formalization of 250,000 businesses.\n\nHe said the ongoing MSME Week has encouraged many businesses to register with regulatory authorities in order for them to benefit from the numerous programmes earmarked by the government for their growth.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of the CITN, Mr Adesina Adedayo, commended the leadership of the Vice President in the implementation of key government interventions in the economy, stating that \u201cwe acknowledge your great zeal and commitment to Nigeria project.\u201d\n\nHe said the visit became necessary given the enormous work the Buhari administration has done towards addressing the huge fiscal challenges in the polity, public financing reforms, and sustained efforts towards addressing infrastructural deficit across the country.\n\nRead Also: Falana Faults FG, Says Decision To Meet With Twitter Should Have Come Earlier\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Economic Sustainability Plan (NESP) and other measures implemented was a right response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic and were largely instrumental to creating buffers for the government at all levels in withstanding the pressures and waves created during the peak period and the aftermath of COVID-19,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we sustain measures already being implemented to improve tax collection at all levels.\u201d\n\nOther members of the delegation included the Vice President of the Institute, Barrister Samuel Olushola Agbeluyi, past Presidents of the institute, Dame Gladys Simplice, and Dr. James Naiyeju, and Council members Prof. Muhammad Mainoma and Hon. Babangida Ibrahim. Mr. Adefisayo Awogbade, CITN Registrar/Chief Executive was also in attendance.",

          "title": "SERAP Asks African Commission To Order FG, NASS To Withdraw Bills To Gag Media",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights in Banjul, The Gambia, to \u201cissue provisional measures to urgently stop the Nigerian government and National Assembly from supporting and pushing through two bills to gag the media, and impose arbitrary and harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, SERAP said: \u201cthe complaint, addressed to the Chairperson of the Commission Mr Solomon Ayele Dersso, and Commissioner and Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, Ms Jamesina Essie L. King, is brought pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u201d\n\nThe complaint followed the move to push through two repressive bills to amend the National Broadcasting Act, and to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act. The bills are reportedly sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr Segun Odebunmi (PDP, Oyo State).\n\nDated June 26, 2021, and signed by its Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP said: \u201cThe push by the Nigerian government and the National Assembly to support and pass the two anti-media bills is unlawful, as passing the bills would be contrary to the country\u2019s obligations to respect, protect, promote and fulfill the right to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom under articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nAccording to the rights group, \u201cthese anti-media bills are the latest threats to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country. The bills are not in keeping with the provisions of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, which supplements articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cthe Commission has the power to request Provisional Measures from the Nigerian government and National Assembly under Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure to prevent irreparable harm and threats to human rights including freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom as urgently as the situation demands.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, read in part: \u201cThe bills include retrogressive provisions that threaten human rights, including freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, and could criminalize reporting and give the government overly broad powers and oversight over journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf passed into laws, the bills would be used by those in power to intimidate and harass their critics, and to stifle freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom. The bills would have a chilling effect on the media thereby inducing some measure of self-censorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedia freedom, which is an aspect of the right to freedom of expression, is now generally recognised as an indispensable element of democracy. The mass media promotes the free flow of information, which enables citizens to participate in a meaningful and informed manner in the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions by the Nigerian government and National Assembly are contrary to Articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter, and have thereby violated Nigeria\u2019s positive obligation under Article 1 to recognise the rights, duties and freedoms and to adopt legislative or other measures to give effect to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP regularly relies on the media to carry out its mandate in the promotion of transparency and accountability and respect for socio-economic rights of Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government and National Assembly are directly responsible for pushing the bills that would gag the media and impose harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in the country, action in violation of the African Charter, and therefore also in violation of Article 1 of the Charter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in the country face a real and immediate risk of violation of their rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom if the anti-media bills are not urgently withdrawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government and National Assembly have failed to produce any evidence that the two bills are necessary or lawful, and in the absence of such, SERAP asks the Commission to order the immediate withdrawal of the bills by Nigerian authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media also serves as a watchdog by scrutinising and criticising public officials over the way they manage public affairs and public resources. In the performance of these functions, the media\u2019s debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open. Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.\u201d\n\n\u201cA free press is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, one in which journalists are both benefactors and beneficiaries of human rights and carrying out their professional duties to inform their communities and enable democratic participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividual journalists cannot do their jobs if the institution of the press is compromised or if the legal protections for that institution are subject to approvals by political authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhaustion of domestic remedies requirements set out in Article 56(5) of the African Charter has been met. There are no effective or sufficient local remedies available to the Complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian courts do not entertain cases on the legality of anti-media and anti-human rights bills. Also, one of the lawmakers pushing the bills Mr Odebunmi Olusegun has reportedly boasted that \u2018No court will stop us from passing the bills. Requiring SERAP to exhaust domestic remedies in such circumstances would be a mockery of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the bills, the National Broadcasting Commission can shut down TV and radio stations \u201cin the public interest\u201d and the press code must be approved by the Minister of Information. The overly broad definition of public interest opens the door for the Nigerian government to crackdown on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bills would also allow the Nigerian government to jail journalists, fine newspapers up to N10m naira ($20,000) or close them for up to a year if they publish \u201cfake\u201d news. Under the bills, journalists could be held liable for the offence committed by their organisations and can be made to pay heavy fines.\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged the commission to request the following provisional measures from the Nigerian government and the National Assembly:\n\n1.Immediately withdraw the oppressive bills to gag the media. The first is the bill to amend the National Broadcasting Act, and the second, is the bill to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act.\n\n2.Immediately end harassment and intimidation of journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in Nigeria, and to respect the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, Unless the African Commission urgently intervenes in this case, there is a risk of irreversible denial of the Complainant\u2019s and Nigerians\u2019 rights, which in turn will render nugatory the resolutions and declarations by the African Commission on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\n\n3.Give assurances that they will not support and pass the anti-media bills being pushed by Nigerian authorities. The Nigerian authorities should also give assurances that they will fully implement the resolutions and declarations on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country.\n\n4.Undertake a prompt review of Nigerian legal framework and administrative practices on freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom to ensure their consistency and compatibility with the African Charter, and resolutions and declarations by the African Commission. Pending this, the Nigerian government should take concrete steps to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, and ensure that journalists and media practitioners are able to carry out their work freely, without any intimidation and harassment.",

          "text": "Katsina United have ended the unbeaten run of Akwa United in the Nigeria Professional Football League.\n\nBefore the matchday 29 fixture at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium in Katsina, Akwa United were unbeaten in 18 league matches. A league record.\n\nLosing 1-0 to Rivers United on matchday 28, the Changi Boys were avoiding back-to-back defeats when they filed out to take on the in-form Promise Keepers. The home side stayed true to their winning objective and it paid off in the 15th minute when they were awarded a penalty.\n\nSamuel Kalu stepped up to the spot and scored. 1-0 and it remained that way till half time.\n\nIn the second half, the visitors tried all they could to get something out of the game. In the 71st minute, Charles Okafor sent a long ball to Akarandut Orok inside the box but the striker failed to convert the chance into a goal.\n\nKatsina United won 1-0 and recorded their 10th win of the season. Unbeaten run over for Akwa United but coach Kennedy Boboye\u2019s team still maintained the top position in the league.\n\nIn Bauchi, the early kick-off match between Wikki Tourists and Lobi Stars ended 1-0 in favour of the hosts. Mohammed Guda\u2019s goal from the penalty spot sealed victory for Wikki, a team in desperate need of victories to avoid the relegation zone. They are currently 15th on the log.\n\nAt the Pantami Stadium in Gombe, Adamawa United showed they will not go down without a fight. The bottom-placed team beat Jigawa Golden Stars to record just their 5th win of the season.\n\nAt the New Jos Stadium, the star match between Plateau United and Enyimba Football Club of Aba ended in a goalless draw. As regards movement on the table, the result didn\u2019t harm both sides so much but win for the People\u2019s Elephant would have shot them into the top four. They are fifth on the log but tied on 49 points with Kwara United.\n\nSadly, another show of fans misconduct was displayed as some players of Enyimba were attacked and injured.\n\nDominant Home Wins\n\nSince moving to the Ahmadu Bello Stadium in Kaduna, Kano Pillars are making it a fortress and getting better match after match. They have drawn just two games at the venue against Rangers and Akwa United.\n\nAfter a disappointing 1-0 loss to Jigawa Golden Stars on matchday 28, Sai Masu Gida needed to get back to winning ways. Going against an unpredictable FC Ifeanyi Ubah team, Coach Ibrahim Musa\u2019s team erased all forms of complacency to get the job done.\n\nDavid Ebuka scored in the 27th minute was good enough to secure victory and give Sai Masu Gida their 15th win of the season, they are third on the log, tied on 52 points with second-placed Nasarawa United, and with their dominant home form, they are still a top contender for the league title.\n\nIn Ilorin, Kwara United continued their dominant home form with a 1-0 win over struggling Sunshine Stars of Akure. The Harmony Boys who are unbeaten at home this season took the lead in the 7th minute via Michael Ohanu\u2019s goal. They held on to the lone goal to record their 14th win of the season and returned into the top four on the league table. Coach Abdullahi Biffo\u2019s team is still the surprise package of the season. It\u2019s the 14th loss of the season for Sunshine Stars who are well placed in the relegation zone.\n\nIn Lafia, Nasarawa United showed class to record a 2-1 victory over Rivers United. The Solid Miners are having fun at home, they score goals and record convincing victories. So far, they hold the record of highest goalscoring team in the league.\n\nMotivated from matchday 28 goalless draw result with Enyimba in Aba, Coach Bala Nikyu\u2019s team needed to consolidate on that performance against Rivers United and they did. Chigozie Obasi opened the scoring for the home side in the 23rd minute while Michael Udeh doubled the lead in the 61st minute. Godwin Aguda pulled one back for the visitors from the spot but that was how far they could go.\n\nNasarawa United held on to win 2-1 and moved to second on the log. It\u2019s the 16th win of the season for the Solid Miners and they moved to second position on the log.\n\nWith just one home defeat, Heartland FC is another team with good home performance. Today, they did the double-over MFM with a 2-0 win at the Dan Anyiam Stadium. On matchday 9, the Naze Millionaires beat MFM 1-2 at the Agege Stadium. It was the first home defeat for the Olukoya Boys this season.\n\nThe reverse fixture provided an opportunity for the Lagos-based team to avenge that loss but with the home superiority of Heartland, it was a difficult task. As early as the 5th minute, Chidera Eze opened scoring for the hosts and in the closing minutes of the game, Kingsley Maduforo scored to seal victory for coach Fidelis Ilechukwu\u2019s team who are now 10th on the log with 41 points.\n\nVital Away Victories\n\nIn Ozoro, the struggle continued for Warri Wolves. Just 2 weeks ago, they lost at home to Dakkada FC, today, they fell at home again. A 67th-minute goal scored by Christian Nnaji gave Rangers International Football Club a vital 1-0 victory over sinking Warri Wolves. It is the 16th time the Wolves are losing this season, they are 19th on the log and will need a miracle to survive relegation.\n\nDakkada FC recorded their third away win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Abia Warriors at the Okigwe Township Stadium. Issac George scored in the 76th minute to give the Chosen Ones another crucial win on the road and inflict the third defeat in a row on the Warriors.\n\nThis is the second defeat to Abia Warriors in Okigwe. Before losing to Enyimba in a rescheduled fixture last week, they were unbeaten at home. Coach Imama Amapakabo\u2019s team have now lost 10 times this season while Dakkada FC recorded their 12th win of the season.\n\nNIGERIA PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE\n\nMatchday 29 Results\n\nKatsina United 1 Akwa United 0\n\nWikki Tourists 1 Lobi Stars 0\n\nAdamawa United 2 Jigawa Golden Stars 0\n\nPlateau United 0 Enyimba FC 0\n\nKano Pillars 1 FC Ifeanyi Ubah 0\n\nKwara United 1 Sunshine Stars 0\n\nNasarawa United 2 Rivers United 1\n\nHeartland FC 2 MFM FC 0\n\nWarri Wolves 0 Rangers Int\u2019l FC 1\n\nAbia Warriors 0 Dakkada FC 1",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the Niger Delta Avengers, who recently emerged and threatened to blow critical oil and gas installations in the region unless specific demands were met.\n\nA statement released on Sunday by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity said it was curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe media was Sunday awash with threats and demands by a group, Niger Delta Avengers, to embark on economic sabotage through bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\n\n\u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the HydroCarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

Tielemans started the first two group wins but did not play against Finland.\n\nWolves defender Nelson Semedo picked up a knock in Portugal\u2019s last outing against France but has since returned to training.\n\nManchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes is hoping to return to the starting line-up after being dropped to the bench for the last game.\n\nDespite being top of Fifa\u2019s world rankings, Belgium have yet to win a major tournament.\n\nAlong with Italy and the Netherlands, Roberto Martinez\u2019s team were one of three sides to finish the group stage with a maximum nine points.\n\nWhile Italy and the Netherlands played their three games at \u2018home\u2019 in Rome and Amsterdam respectively, Belgium overcame Russia in St Petersburg, came from behind to beat Denmark in Copenhagen before returning to St Petersburg to defeat Finland.\n\nEuro 2016 winners Portugal made it through to the last 16 as one of the best four third-placed teams.\n\nThey lost to Germany 4-2 in Munich after winning 3-0 in Hungary before a dramatic 2-2 draw with world champions France in Budapest.\n\nSince the end of the 2018 World Cup, Lukaku has scored 23 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Belgium, while also providing four assists.\n\nThe Inter Milan forward netted three goals in the group stage, including two in one match against Russia.\n\nRonaldo, 36, is now the top-scoring European player at major tournaments (World Cup and European Championship), with his double against France in the last game moving him beyond Miroslav Klose (19) to 21 goals.\n\nIndeed, that was Ronaldo\u2019s second double of Euro 2020 already \u2013 no player has registered three in a single tournament at the European Championship.\n\n\u201cAt his age, he continues to shine and I\u2019m going to try and get as close to his achievements as possible,\u201d Lukaku, 28, said of his Portuguese rival.\n\nBoth sides have got plenty of match-winners, capable of a moment of genius. I\u2019d argue Belgium have the edge going forward but their defence has got mistakes in them.\n\nIt is very difficult to call, and I think this will be settled by a penalty shoot-out.\n\nSimon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen\u2019s Gracenote: Belgium are the top-ranked club in Europe according to Gracenote\u2019s World Ranking, ahead of France, Italy and Portugal.\n\nProgress to the last 16 has increased Belgium\u2019s chance of winning the tournament from 14.1% to 15% but they are now second favourites due to being in the tougher half of the draw.\n\nPortugal have been unlucky with the draw in this tournament, firstly ending up in Group F with France and Germany, and now having to face Belgium in the last 16.\n\nPortugal\u2019s Gracenote World Football Ranking of fourth in Europe implies that they are capable of a semi-final place but they first have to knock out a team who are theoretically better than them.\n\nThis is the first meeting between Belgium and Portugal at a major tournament.\n\nPortugal are unbeaten in their past five matches against Belgium across all competitions (W3 D2) since a 3-0 defeat in World Cup qualifying in September 1989.\n\nBelgium have only failed to score in two of their last 58 games under Roberto Martinez.\n\nDespite playing just 134 minutes so far, Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in three of Belgium\u2019s seven goals at Euro 2020, netting once and providing two assists.\n\nBelgium\u2019s victory over Finland last time out marked their ninth win at a World Cup and European Championship combined under Roberto Martinez, with the Spaniard now holding the outright managerial record for major tournament wins with the Red Devils.\n\nPortugal have conceded six goals in three games at Euro 2020 so far, already one more than they did at Euro 2016 when they went on to lift the trophy.\n\nPortugal have qualified for the knockout stages of the European Championship in third place for the second tournament in a row, also doing so in 2016 before going on to win it.\n\nPortugal\u2019s return of four points from three group games is the poorest return for a defending champion at a European Championship since Greece in 2008.",

          "text": "Donald Trump has held his first campaign-style rally since leaving the White House, repeating his election grievances and baseless claims of fraud as he urged his supporters to help Republicans win back majorities in the United States Congress.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally in Ohio \u2013 a state the former president carried in the 2020 election \u2013 marks a return to the kind of freewheeling mass gatherings that have been critical to retaining the support of his base.\n\nIt was held to support Max Miller, a former White House aide who is challenging Republican Representative Anthony Gonzalez for his congressional seat. Gonzalez was one of 10 Republican House members who voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in the wake of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has pledged to back those who challenge the 10 legislators in the upcoming Republican primaries.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress will be on the line in the 2022 midterm elections and history favors Republicans\u2019 chances of gaining seats in those contests.\n\n\u201cWe will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon,\u201d Trump told thousands of cheering supporters at Ohio\u2019s Lorain County Fairgrounds.\n\nSo far, nine of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment have drawn primary challengers. The former president has offered to support anyone who steps forward to challenge the remaining candidate, Representative John Katko of New York, according to the website syracuse.com.\n\nTrump has also endorsed a challenger to Senator Lisa Murkowski, the only one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict him in his January impeachment trial who is up for re-election in 2022.\n\nThe Ohio event in Wellington, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Cleveland, was the first of three public appearances, followed by a trip to the US-Mexico border on June 30 and a rally in Sarasota, Florida, on July 3.\n\nWhile Trump praised Miller as an \u201cincredible patriot\u201d and a \u201cgreat guy\u201d who \u201cloves the people of Ohio,\u201d he spent much of his 90-minute address fixating on the 2020 election, which he insists he won, even though top state and local election officials, his own attorney general and numerous judges, including some he appointed, have said there is no evidence of the mass voter fraud he alleges took place.\n\n\u201cThis was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe 2020 presidential election was rigged. We won that election in a landslide.\u201d\n\nThe crowd chanted \u201cTrump won\u201d and \u201cfour more years! four more years!\u201d. But the former president made no clear mention of his political future.\n\nHe did however tease the crowd at one point by alluding to the possibility of another stab at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe may have to win it a third time. It is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nA supporter waits for former President Donald Trump to speak at a rally at the Lorain County Fairgrounds, Saturday, June 26, 2021, in Wellington, Ohio [Tony Dejak/ AP]\n\nWhether Trump runs again could be influenced by the outcome of various legal troubles.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan informed his company on Thursday that it could soon face criminal charges stemming from a wide-ranging investigation into the former president\u2019s business dealings. The New York Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that charges could be filed against the Trump Organization within days.\n\nTrump has denounced the investigations as nothing more than a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d aimed at damaging him politically.\n\nThe former president also used the Ohio rally to lambast Biden, calling him a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and focusing on the rising number of immigrants crossing over the US southern border \u2013 an issue Republicans have zeroed in on to rally their voters.\n\n\u201cYou have millions of people coming into our country. We have no idea who they are. Joe Biden is doing the exact opposite as we did,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is destroying our nation before our very eyes,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies have been instrumental to his politics since he launched his 2016 campaign and his supporters in Ohio said they hoped he would use such events to help unify the party behind like-minded candidates for Congress.\n\n\u201cContinuing these rallies is extremely important,\u201d said Jessica Dicken, a 30-year-old stay-at-home mother from southeast Ohio, adding Trump could be \u201ca voice for the more conservative movement here in Ohio and across the nation\u201d.\n\nChris Laskowski, 55, who lives in Medina, Ohio, said she missed Trump.\n\n\u201cI think they robbed him of the election and he\u2019s still our president.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated false claims of election fraud have taken hold of the Republican Party, with 53 percent of Republican voters saying they believe Trump won the 2020 election, according to a Reuters/ Ipsos poll. They blamed his loss on illegal voting, the poll found.\n\nRepublican strategist Matt Dole said both Trump and those vying to stay close to him benefited from the public bonhomie on display at the Ohio event. Some of the candidates now seeking his endorsement have made disparaging comments about Trump in the past.\n\n\u201cThese are marriages of convenience,\u201d said Dole, who is based in Ohio. \u201cDonald Trump is using these opportunities to keep his name out there, to keep the base motivated.\u201d",

          "text": "Authorities in several countries \u2013 from Bangladesh and Indonesia to Australia and Israel \u2013 are racing to contain the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, while Russia\u2019s Saint Petersburg announced a record death toll, laying bare the challenges faced by nations worldwide in their efforts to return to pre-pandemic life.\n\nWhile vaccination campaigns have brought down infections in mostly wealthy nations, the rise of the Delta variant has stoked fears of new waves of a virus that has already killed nearly four million people.\n\n\u201cThere is currently a lot of concern about the Delta variant,\u201d World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a Friday news briefing.\n\n\u201cDelta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far, has been identified in at least 85 countries and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations.\u201d\n\nIn Bangladesh, authorities announced they would impose a new national lockdown from Monday over the variant, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed.\n\nAustralia\u2019s largest city Sydney, meanwhile, entered a two-week lockdown, with people ordered to stay home except for essential trips.\n\nSydney\u2019s new restrictions apply to some five million people, along with hundreds of thousands of others living in nearby towns.\n\nNew Zealand, citing \u201cmultiple outbreaks\u201d in Australia, announced a three-day suspension of its quarantine-free travel arrangement with its larger neighbour.\n\nAustralia\u2019s COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the suspension would give officials time to consider measures \u201cto make the bubble safer, such as pre-departure testing for all flights\u201d between the two countries.\n\nIn Indonesia, President Joko Widodo said the country of 270 million people was facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d and pledged to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d. The country recorded more than 21,000 new infections on Saturday, the highest daily tally yet.\n\nDelta, which was first identified in India in April, is so contagious that experts say more than 80 percent of a population would need to be inoculated in order to contain it \u2013 a challenging target even for nations with significant vaccination programmes.\n\nThe variant is now responsible for more than 90 percent of all new infections in the United Kingdom and about 30 percent in the United States.\n\nEuropean scientists estimate Delta is 40 to 60 percent more contagious than the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first discovered in the United Kingdom, which itself was more infectious than the original virus first detected in late 2019.\n\n\u201cIt infects more people, it can spread faster,\u201d vaccinologist Dr Annelies Wilder Smith, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe saw it in India. We\u2019re seeing it in Australia and Indonesia, in the UK. And I think we\u2019ll see now increasingly in Europe, and indeed, also in the Americas,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it really also causes more severe disease has not yet been confirmed. So if you see more disease you will also see more hospitalisations \u2013 that does not mean that the virus itself causes more severe disease.\u201d\n\nExperts say Delta spreads more easily because of mutations that help it latch onto cells in the body. While several studies have shown that vaccines are slightly less effective against Delta, they are still highly effective \u2013 but only after the second dose.\n\nIsrael, which has one of the world\u2019s most successful vaccination campaigns, has seen infections linked to the variant surge since dropping a requirement to wear masks in enclosed public places 10 days ago.\n\nAfter four days of more than 100 new cases a day, the health ministry has now reversed that decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s Euro 2020 host Saint Petersburg on Saturday reported the country\u2019s highest daily COVID-19 death toll for a city since the start of the pandemic.\n\nOfficial figures said Saint Petersburg, which has already hosted six matches of the football tournament and is due to host a quarter-final on Friday, recorded 107 virus deaths during the past 24 hours.\n\nAuthorities in the Russian city tightened anti-coronavirus restrictions last week in an effort to curb the spike in new infections, including closing food courts in the city\u2019s shopping malls and its Euro 2020 fan zone. This came as Russia has seen an explosion of new cases since mid-June, driven by the Delta variant.\n\nIn neighbouring Finland, health officials said they had detected a spike in coronavirus infections that was traced to football fans returning from Saint Petersburg. The Finnish health institute\u2019s director, Mika Salminen, told public broadcaster YLE that more than 120 cases have so far been identified from passengers returning from the Russian city, mostly football fans, and the number is likely to increase.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Paul Brennan, reporting from London, said there have been concerns about a link between the tournament and COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\u201cAttendance at these stadiums has been pre-conditional on you actually showing a negative coronavirus test. But that doesn\u2019t stop people\u2019s mingling in the streets and mixing with other members of the public who don\u2019t have to go through these tests,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned infections were also surging at an alarming rate in at least 12 countries in Africa, with the Delta variant leading to unprecedented hospitalisations.\n\nAccording to the WHO, only one percent of Africans are fully vaccinated \u2013 the lowest ratio globally.\n\nIn South Africa, the continent\u2019s worst-hit country, scientists said on Saturday the Delta variant appeared to be dominating new infections. On Friday, authorities registered 18,000 new cases.\n\nActing Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane told the same news conference that it was now likely that the peak of the third wave would surpass the peak of the second wave in January.\n\nIn Europe, however, some countries announced the lifting of restrictions even as scientists have warned that Delta was expected to account for 90 percent of all new cases in the European Union by the end of August.\n\nSpain on Saturday brought an end to mandatory outdoor mask-wearing, a year after the rule was first introduced.\n\nThe decision came despite the announcement of a major coronavirus cluster in the capital, Madrid, traced to a student trip to the holiday island of Mallorca, with more than 2,000 people ordered to self-isolate.\n\nThe Netherlands also ended its rules on outdoor mask-wearing, while easing restrictions on indoor dining and reopening nightclubs to people who have tested negative.\n\nAnd Switzerland scrapped most of its remaining coronavirus restrictions on Saturday after Health Minister Alain Berset said this week that the country\u2019s use of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines gave adequate protection against the Delta variant.",
