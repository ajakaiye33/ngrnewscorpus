          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA systematic review of 45 studies on COVID-19 survivors has revealed that many of them even after recovery, still frequently experience health challenges such as shortness of breath, fatigue and sleep disorders.\n\nIn the systematic review, the authors used data from cohort studies to examine the frequency, variety, and severity of persistent symptoms among individuals with previous COVID-19 infection and found out that shortness of breath remained the most frequent.\n\nAccording to the authors of the review recently published in JAMA Network Open, more than 70 per cent of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 experience at least one persistent symptom for at least 60 days.\n\nJAMA Network Open is a monthly open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association covering all aspects of the biomedical sciences.\n\n\u201cWith millions of individuals experiencing COVID-19 infection, persistent symptoms are a burden on individual patients and their families, as well as on outpatient care, public health, and the economy,\u201d Tahmina Nasserie, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at Stanford University wrote.\n\nNasserie and colleagues in the review involving 45 studies including 9,751 participants with COVID-19 found that COVID-19 symptoms usually persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life.\n\n\u201cPersistent symptoms were defined as those persisting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalisation or at least 30 days after recovery from the acute illness or hospital discharge.\n\n\u201cIndividual symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea (26 studies; median frequency, 36 per cent, fatigue or exhaustion (25 studies; median frequency, 40 per cent and sleep disorders or insomnia eight studies; median 29.4 per\n\ncent.\n\n\u201cThis systematic review found that persistent COVID-19 symptoms were common, with 72.5 per cent of patients reporting at least one symptom at 60 days or more after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalisation or 30 days or more after recovery from acute illness or hospital discharge.\n\n\u201cThis finding was consistent even among studies that followed up patients for almost six months with 22,43 suggesting that symptoms may persist long after recovery among some patients.\n\n\u201cMost patients reported thus far were previously hospitalised. This finding suggests that inclusion of the prolonged burden of morbidity is warranted for future research on the overall health implications of the pandemic\u201d, the authors said.\n\nContinuing, the authors noted, \u201cThe most frequently reported persistent symptoms were fatigue and shortness of breath, both of which can be debilitating.\n\n\u201cAtypical chest pain was reported in approximately one of seven patients. Inability to concentrate, informally described as brain fog, was only examined in four studies and was experienced by approximately one in four patients,\u201d they said.\n\nAccording to the authors, \u201cthe findings of this review should help to improve future study quality and reduce heterogeneity in study design and reporting, enabling researchers to better assess the risk of long-term outcomes associated with COVID-19 and physicians to better advise and treat their patients\u201d.\n\nEarlier research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that many people who recover from the virus have heart inflammation (myocarditis). Of the 100 survivors in the study, 78 had evidence of previous heart inflammation, and 60 showed ongoing inflammation at the time of observation.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says little is known about why some people, after coming through the acute phase of COVID-19, struggle to recover and suffer ongoing symptoms including tiredness, brain fog, cardiac and neurological disorders.\n\nClinical Care Lead in the WHO\u2019s Emergencies Programme, Janet Diaz told AFP in an interview that it is time to start looking into post- COVID conditions.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t fully understand what Long COVID is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit to learn, but I am confident that the scientific community is really rallying around,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nShe said British and other studies suggested potentially one in 10 cases may have prolonged symptoms one month after infection, but there was no picture yet of how long those conditions might persist.\n\n\u201cPeople may have prolonged symptoms, but we do know people are recovering. It may take a long time, but they are still recovering to previous health,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a Consultant Physician and Cardiologist with Providence Multi-Specialty Hospital, Abuja, Dr. John Asekhame, said COVID-19 affects the whole body and the effects are more with those with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nAsekhame explained, \u201cOnce you recover from a disease that affects the whole body, it is good for you to see a specialist to review you to assess your level of function.\n\n\u201cThe specialist will assess your heart, lungs, kidneys, blood, liver and the whole body to be sure that the long-term effects are not staggering.\n\n\u201cThis is important particularly for survivors with pre-existing health conditions. For example, a survivor with diabetes will need more health checks than the one that does not have. Again, an elderly man with hypertension who has had a stroke in the past, definitely his condition will need more review than a young survivor without health issues.\n\n\u201cSo, every survivor just needs to go for a follow-up because this is a new disease. Prevention is better than cure. So, it is better to see a doctor and ensure that things are not taken you unawares.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Udeme Akpan\n\nTHE Host Communities Producing Oil and Gas in Nigeria, HOSCOM, weekend, disclosed that the three per cent, about $500 million, provided for in the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, would be utilized to achieve sustainable development in the oil and gas communities.\n\nIn a telephone interview with Energy Vanguard, Chairman, HOSCOM, Dr Mike Emuh, who noted many decades of neglect, said: \u201cWe have been agitating for the development of the communities, which is lack electricity, water, roads and jobs for their youths. These communities have been neglected for several years. Everybody is suffering. However, we must appreciate what the 9th National Assembly has done. The creation of a special fund for oil and gas communities will go a long way in addressing the injustice.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the right strategies for development, Emuh, said: \u201cThe best form of strategy is peace and unity. We need to sink our differences and come together for the purpose of bringing development to our people. We need everybody to come together, including youth, women, and men. We need technocrats or experts in various fields to be united. When we are all together, it will be easy to draw and execute plans desired for development. We can easily turn the communities to another Dubai in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, said: \u201cThe oil and gas communities have been exposed to many environmental hazards, especially oil spills, gas flaring, from the beginning of petroleum operations in the Niger Delta. Unfortunately, these which still take place have impacted negatively on our land, water, and air, thus affecting the livelihood of the oil and gas communities. We are looking at a number of issues, including remediation. But like I noted earlier, the people must be united so that it would be easy for us to execute our plans.\u201d\n\nHowever, he commended some persons and institutions that supported the current provision in the PIB, explaining that, \u201cPIB, has become a reality. We are hopeful that the provisions in the bill would go a long way to addressing environmental and other issues in the communities.\n\n\u201cWe commend President Muhammadu Buhari, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, the National Assembly, the Senate President, President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, Speaker, Traditional Rulers of Oil Mineral Producing Communities, TROMPCON, Pan-Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, His Royal Majesty King Alfred Diete-Spiff, Amanyanabo of Twon-Brass Kingdom, and others for their various roles.\n\n\u201cThe government should continue to support the oil and gas communities in order to sustain peace and stabilize petroleum operations. The operators should also continue to do more for the communities as their immediate hosts while the community should be united as well as bring their expertise to bear in achieving sustainable development.\u201d\n\nHe also added: \u201cIt has been a long struggle, spanning many years. In the end, 13 per cent derivation was paid to the oil and gas producing States. But the oil and gas communities have not been feeling the impact of the derivation.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we have severally called on the Federal government to emerge with the community host fund in order to stimulate sustainable development in the areas. In our view, this is right, apparently because these are areas that produce the oil and gas and also the environmental pollution that goes with the oil and gas operations. Besides, the fund, we have also proposed the establishment of modular refineries because of the presence of crude oil in commercial quantities in these communities.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Mark Esset, speaking with journalists in Uyo, the state capital, on Tuesday hinted that plan is underway by his committee to embark on a quarterly visit to councils to ascertain the level of compliance.\n\nIt was however gathered that over 98 percent of council chairmen operate from Uyo while others operate from their personal houses built outside the local government headquarters, thereby promoting absenteeism in office.\n\nAccording to Esset, \u201cYou should recall that the sixth Assembly had passed a resolution, mandating Local Government Councils Chiefs and other key officers to relocate to the security villages to be closer to the people.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the council chairmen have refused to abide by the resolution.

Aniekpon Ekpo, Chairman, Mkpat Enin LGA said, \u201cI am living in the security estate in my local government, and this has afforded me opportunity to acquaint myself with the challenges of the area and people.\n\n\u201cI implore others to do so to reduce the rural-urban drift.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, Ini LGA, Mr Israel Idaisin, disclosed that the 100 units estate in his domain have been leased to private school operators as polytechnic in order to wash off criminal elements, who have occupied the facility for unwholesome activities.",

We\u2019ve not seen him. That has been agreed and we are going to see him soon\u201c, he said.\n\nThe third: An application to get Kanu transferred to the Kuje Correctional Centre. \u201cThe application was made on July 14, 2021\u201d, Ejiofor hinted.\n\nJustice Nyako rejected the plea, insisting Kanu is safe, secure and being kept in good conditions at the DSS.\n\nHowever, intelligence agencies are not comfortable with the request. They believe the motive is a jail break being \u201cplanned\u201d by IPOB and its militant wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nAn officer told PRNigeria that a grand plan of a massive attack on the Kuje Prison had been uncovered.\n\n\u201cThey want him transferred to the prison so they can storm there as they have done to many Police Stations and Correctional Centres in the South-East in the last six months.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu celebrated the destruction when he emphasized via his Twitter account that no soul deserved to be locked up in any Nigerian prison. Imagine him now saying that\u2019s where he prefers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source pointed out that prominent individuals arrested and detained at the DSS are normally given better treatment, compared to police cells.\n\nThe law enforcement circle asserts IPOB/ESN members carried out the assault on Imo Prison and Police Headquarters with sophisticated weapons such as General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), Sub-Machine Guns (SMGs), AK49 rifles, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs) and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).\n\nA separate source told DAILY POST on Tuesday that Kuje Prison may not be able to withstand a coordinated intrusion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be sincere with you, the facility isn\u2019t a place for a high-profile suspect like Nnamdi Kanu who has thousands of die-hard followers.\n\n\u201cKuje Prison is not extremely fortified and you know it\u2019s actually not within Abuja. So if there\u2019s a situation, damage might have been done before reinforcement gets there.\u201d\n\nNigerian authorities argue that foreign countries and partners agree that the carnage by IPOB and ESN, including the murder of security agents and civilians, justify Kanu\u2019s arrest.\n\nKanu was intercepted in Kenya and repatriated on June 27, 2021 after years on the run.

Extraordinary rendition, or any other transfer, without due process is prohibited\u201d.\n\n\u201cA victim of extraordinary rendition is entitled to remedies mandated by the Charter.\n\n\u201cTherefore, among many other reliefs, I requested that Kanu be restored to his state of being before the rendition, which state of being was that he travelled to Kenya on his British passport and was duly admitted as such and as a free man.\n\n\u201cFurther, that no valid territorial jurisdiction can issue from an act of extraordinary rendition because Kanu is, technically speaking, still in Kenya.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAnd that the Nigerian bench warrant standing against Kanu is, in the absence of any successful extradition proceedings in Kenya, invalid to arrest in Kenya.\n\n\u201cI also requested the Commission to adopt other urgent measures as the Commission sees fit in the circumstances to protect Nnamdi Kanu in the interim. A fact-finding visitation to Nigeria is also in reckoning.\n\n\u201cIn my previous press briefings, I had said \u2013 with much confidence \u2013 that Kanu\u2019s trial will be a trial within trial. To those who didn\u2019t fully grasp what it meant, this extant continental legal action will give you a clue. And this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, any nation that dabbles in extraordinary rendition has unwittingly brought impediments to her territorial jurisdiction. So, Nigeria, whether it admits it or not, has triggered a hornets nest that has, for the first time, brought the international legal order to bear on the matter of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d",

          "text": "South African payments and software platform, Yoco, has secured $83 million in Series C funding, bringing the total funds raised to date by the startup to $107 million.\n\nThe company plans to deploy the funds to develop more tools that enable small micro and medium businesses (SMMEs) thrive in the digital economy. It also plans to expand beyond South Africa as the demand for digital payments among African small businesses grows.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, this investment will unlock capacity for us to accelerate product development for our merchants and continue on our growth trajectory in South Africa and beyond,\u201d CEO Katlego Maphai said.\n\nThe latest round is the largest single investment raised by a payments company in South Africa and the largest ever by a small business-focused payments platform in the Middle East and Africa (MENA).\n\nThe Yoco founding team (L-R): Katlego Maphai, Bradley Wattrus, Lungisa Matshoba, and Carl Wazen. Image credit: Yoco\n\nThe Yoco journey\n\nLaunched in 2015, Yoco was known initially for its portable card machines. Today, the company offers a wide array of financial services which include online and in-store payments, business software, and capital to small business merchants.\n\nThe creation of Yoco was necessary for the payments market in South Africa as millions of businesses lacked access to electronic payments, despite more than three-quarters of adult consumers carrying a card, Maphai told TechCabal in an emailed response.\n\n\u201cWhen we started to plunge deeper into the problem, we found that traditional banks made it challenging and a privilege for businesses to get a card machine. Traditional POS systems come with high monthly and transaction fees and appeal to mainly the established business operation.\u201d\n\nYoco was launched to lower these barriers and enable small businesses to thrive. \u201cOur expertise and efforts centre around driving financial inclusion and lowering the barriers of entry for our customers (small businesses),\u201d Maphai said.\n\nIn less than six years, Yoco has become the payments partner for over 150,000 small businesses across South Africa, processing more than $1 billion in card payments per year.\n\nThe company\u2019s growth has been driven almost exclusively by small, independent businesses that were previously cash-only.\n\nOpportunity for further growth\n\nAccording to Carl Wazen, Yoco\u2019s chief business officer, the company is still at the beginning of its journey despite being the largest payments platform in South Africa. This, he explained, is because there are over 6 million small businesses in South Africa and well over 100 million across the MENA region that still transact only in cash.\n\n\u201cRecent consumer behaviour shows a shift away from cash and businesses must rapidly adapt to this change. This presents a huge opportunity and it is our mission to support that transition,\u201d Wazen said.\n\nTo seize the opportunity, Yoco plans to deepen its operations in South Africa in addition to a pan-African expansion goal. The company is currently piloting its technologies in Mauritius with plans to add another country in the MENA region by the beginning of 2022.\n\n\u201cAs a relatively young company, we\u2019re intently focused on our immediate goals and objectives and on getting the basics like customer value and consistent delivery exactly right,\u201d Maphai said. \u201cBut we still have our eyes firmly fixed on our ambitious longer-term goal: expansion of our operation into a respected, truly pan-African brand.\u201d\n\nThe goal, according to Wazen, is to reach at least a million merchants within the next four years. Yoco aims to increase its team by 200 people within the coming year to support the growth plans.\n\nAlready, the startup has attracted top veterans to its executive ranks from companies such as Monzo, iZettle/Paypal, and Uber. A new Chairman has also been brought on board: Juan Fuentes, former Managing Director of Pagseguro, a business that he grew into a $19 billion payments giant in Brazil.\n\nThe Series C round included new investors such as Dragoneer Investment Group, which is making its Africa investment debut, after having previously backed fintech giants like Chime, Nubank, Mercado Libre, Square, and Klarna.\n\nAlso joining the round were Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, The Raba Partnership, 4DX Ventures, TO Ventures, and several current and former executives from global tech leaders such as Coinbase, Revolut, Spotify, and Gojek.\n\nExisting Yoco investors including Partech, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Orange Ventures, and Quona Capital also took part in the round.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMaphai is confident that this latest funding and Yoco\u2019s unique small business-focused approach, coupled with its depth of talent and now the backing of some of the world\u2019s leading investors, positions the digital payments platform on a springboard to significant and long term growth.\n\n\u201cWorking so closely with small businesses during a global pandemic, we have a first-hand account of how agile these businesses need to be in a rapidly changing world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRemoving barriers and levelling the playing field by creating access to financial tools is a big part of answering these challenges. This new capital injection translates into an acceleration of access for small businesses in our region and beyond, bringing our vision of open commerce forward.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From MIT to MDaaS: Meet the couple solving Nigeria\u2019s medical diagnostics problem",
          "text": "It was 2015 when Oluwasoga Oni made a decision. While studying for a master\u2019s degree in Systems Engineering and Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he took a class that challenged him \u2013 alongside his classmates \u2013 to develop a business that could impact a billion lives.\n\nComing from a medical background, he used the opportunity to create a solution for a problem he had firsthand experience with: Lack of access to quality medical equipment in Nigerian hospitals. MDaaS Global was born in January 2016, with the aim of solving the challenge for thousands of health establishments in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe business idea had been percolating for a while as I grew up around health care,\u201d Oluwasoga told TechCabal. \u201cMy father is a medical doctor who has run a hospital in a small town in Nigeria for over 35 years, and I witnessed the issues he faced accessing medical equipment. So the challenge of accessing quality medical equipment is close to home for me.\u201d\n\nThrough his personal experience and research across Nigeria, Oluwasoga saw a massive social and business opportunity to serve low- and middle-income patients better.\n\nHe started MDaaS with a multidisciplinary team of co-founders \u2013 Opeyemi Ologun, Joe McCord, and Genevieve Barnard Oni. He met McCord and Genevieve in that class at MIT.\n\nThe founding team\u2019s experiences helped prepare them to build their startup from scratch, according to Oluwasoga who started his career in Software Engineering before transitioning into Systems Engineering. \u201cOur diverse backgrounds, experiences, and strengths were extremely helpful in the early days when it was really just the four of us.\u201d\n\nOlogun is an engineer by training and has extensive operations and sales experience in Nigeria. In contrast, Joe has a Master\u2019s degree in Supply Chain Management and has managed supply chains in 11 African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nMDaaS founding team. (L-R): Joseph McCord, Opeyemi Ologun, Genevieve Barnard Oni, and Oluwasoga Oni.\n\nGenevieve has a Master\u2019s degree in Business and Public Administration, with a background in Public Health and International Development and prior experiences working in Uganda, Malawi, and Ghana.\n\nMost of her work was in rural public health facilities. But, like Oluwasoga, she also saw the challenges doctors faced operating with limited resources amid other inefficiencies in the medical equipment space.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Soga, we spent our first date talking about medical equipment in rural and peri-urban places,\u201d Genevieve recalled in a 2019 interview.\n\nAt the time, she was working in the Global Healthcare Entrepreneurship program at Babson College. The program exposed her to several social organisations that are transforming Africa\u2019s healthcare industry.\n\nFor their second date, Genevieve heard Oluwasoga pitch an early iteration of MDaaS Global. Eventually, she joined the team.\n\nRunning a multimillion-dollar startup as a couple\n\nOluwasoga and Genevieve Barnard Oni have been married for over three years now while co-running MDaaS Global. The idea would be intolerable to some couples who want a clear separation between work and home life while desirable to others who dream of working with their life partners.\n\nFor Oluwasoga and Genevieve, finding a balance between job and family time is crucial. \u201cAs all founders will know, it can be really difficult not to work on your business 24/7, and being married to your co-founder can make that even harder,\u201d he said.\n\nSo how do they create the balance? Oluwasoga explained that during the Covid-19 lockdowns last year, the couple started verbally letting each other know when the office was \u201cclosed for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur closing times don\u2019t have to be the same, and some days the office never closes, but it helps us to create some boundaries between work and home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Onis also started some new non-work hobbies together including brewing beer, running, and taking French classes.\n\n\u201cNot only are these new things really fun, but they also help us to be more intentional about spending quality time together outside of work.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe MDaaS evolution\n\nAfter founding the startup from his class at MIT, Oluwasoga secured some funding from an angel investor and returned to Nigeria to work on his healthcare idea full-time.\n\nThe name MDaaS is an abbreviation of \u201cMedical Devices as a Service,\u201d which harkens to the original iteration of the company.\n\nAt the early stage, the startup began with direct sales (and service support) of secondary medical equipment from U.S. markets to Nigerian hospitals. However, most of their clients struggled to purchase the tools. MDaaS switched to a leasing program but that also failed.\n\n\u201cWe initially provided refurbished medical equipment sales, leasing, and servicing to small and medium hospitals. But we saw that most of our target hospitals lacked the economies of scale needed to justify these capital outlays, even at our reduced prices,\u201d Oluwasoga said.\n\nMDaaS then decided to roll out its current asset-sharing model. So rather than equip individual health facilities, MDaas installs and operates modern, tech-enabled diagnostic centres that aggregate demand from small and medium healthcare facilities in underserved communities.\n\nMDaaS offers imaging, cardiac, and lab services to identify life-threatening diseases, especially non-communicable ones (NCDs), and earlier for treatment through its centres. Its services help address the lack of access to diagnostics and preventive care for Nigerians, one of the significant problems that have long plagued Nigeria\u2019s underfunded healthcare sector.\n\nMDaaS offers imaging, cardiac, and lab services to identify life-threatening diseases, especially non-communicable ones (NCDs), and earlier for treatment through its centres.\n\nAccording to Oluwasoga, operating the high volume and low-cost model allows MDaaS to provide excellent clinical quality at prices patients can afford. For instance, an obstetric ultrasound, one of the startup\u2019s most common procedures, can cost as little as \u20a61,200 (around $3) compared to \u20a65,000 \u2013 \u20a620,000 ($12 \u2013 $50) charged at typical clinics and hospitals.\n\nBut even as MDaaS services are priced low, some patients in low-income communities still cannot pay, Oluwasoga said.\n\nGrowth across board\n\nMDaaS launched its first diagnostic centre in Ibadan in 2017 and has added six more in other states and cities, including in Lagos and Ogun.\n\nIn June, MDaas secured a $2.3 million seed round extension to increase their physical locations in Lagos, Oyo, Kwara, Edo, Kogi, and Kaduna states. They plan to create more virtual and home-based care options to make its services more accessible.\n\nThe startup has experienced rapid growth across various indicators. For example, it has performed over 80,000 diagnostics tests, grown from a 4-person founding team to a team of over 70, partnered with over 500 health facilities and 10 HMO networks, and expanded its referral network to include over 750 clinicians.\n\nOluwasoga\u2019s dream is to build the largest network of physical and virtual diagnostic and primary care facilities in Africa. \u201cWe currently work to achieve this big goal through our chain of tech-enabled diagnostic centres, BeaconHealth Diagnostics, and our new virtual-first preventive care product, SentinelX.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, MDaaS secured a one-million-dollar seed round. Besides other funding raised over the last five years, they have now raised a total of $3.7 million.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In the first half of this year, investments in African startups have risen back to pre-covid levels. While there\u2019s more excitement about big investment firms like Sequoia and Tiger Global who are making bold statements about their interest in Africa with their investments, some newer players are looking to take part in the action.\n\nOne of such players is Expert DOJO, a US-based early-stage fund that has decided to commit up to $5m to invest in African startups this year. It\u2019ll be making 20 to 50 new investments.\n\nSince the firm\u2019s first fund launched in 2018, Expert DOJO has invested in over 100 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across 30 countries. Some of these companies include Shipsi, Squadra and Woodpecker.\n\nExpert DOJO decided to focus more on Africa when it noticed that some of the strongest performers in its portfolio were from across Africa.\n\nSetting itself apart from other global accelerators, Expert DOJO has assembled an entire Africa-dedicated team plus cross-functional experts and Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs).\n\nIn addition to its new fund, the firm will dedicate an Africa-only cohort this September 2021 (currently accepting applications) to startups targeting the African market. Similar to the international cohort program, for this cohort, Expert DOJO, is looking to provide $100,000 in funding and a three-month virtual accelerator program.\n\nWhich startups qualify for this? Tech-enabled startups with a proven and scalable product. These startups also must have their main operations based in Africa and generate at least $5,000 monthly recurring revenue.\n\nStarNews Mobile, a mobile video network for Africa, is one of the first African startups Expert DOJO invested in. It currently has over 10m mobile subscribers across Africa and has secured content partnerships with Universal and Sony Music distribution as well as marketing partnerships with Pan-African mobile operators MTN, Orange, and Moov.\n\nHow was Expert DOJO helpful to StarNews Mobile? \u201cThey helped with introducing us to service providers like Accountant, legal counsel and digital marketing. They also provided strategic advice,\u201d Guy Kamgaing, the company\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t necessarily looking for investment in 2019 when Expert DOJO invested. But the turning point for him was when he realized that apart from money, Expert DOJO had a support network and were focused on understanding Africa better.\n\n\u201cOver the years,\u201d Kamgaing said, \u201cExpert DOJO has been consistent in terms of their interest and commitment to African companies.\u201d\n\nBrian Mac Mahon (Expert DOJO) and Guy Kamgaing (StarNews)\n\nFor Brian Mac Machon, the founder of Expert DOJO, they were motivated by the success of startups like StarNews to invest further in Africa.\n\n\u201cOne commonality we\u2019ve seen throughout our Africa portfolio is these founders\u2019 focus on growth from day one, with extraordinary resilience, grit, and most importantly, results. We\u2019ve witnessed these startups take the tools and resources provided in the DOJO accelerator and scale at super speed, well beyond industry standards,\u201d Mac Machon said.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about Expert DOJO?\n\n65% of DOJO\u2019s portfolio companies are women or minority-led. \u201cWith a valuation of $32M and the third most active startup accelerator in the United States, Expert DOJO aims to close the global inequities in venture capital funding: \u201cWe\u2019re investing in founders who represent the diverse society we live in, and not just the privileged Silicon Valley elite,\u201d Mac Mahon said.\n\nAnother of Expert DOJO\u2019s notable investments is Klasha, a female-led Nigerian fintech startup.\n\nJess Anuna, CEO of Klasha shared her DOJO experience by saying that DOJO works relentlessly to secure funding for their startups and ensure they\u2019re being introduced to the right investors that will help their company scale, invest in future rounds, and strategically align with their company\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nFor startups that go through Expert DOJO\u2019s acceleration program the support received goes beyond the three months. Victoria Mehran, an Investment associate at Expert Dojo explained this saying, \u201cWe\u2019re committed to supporting them for life. We are hopping on growth strategy calls with all our founders. Brian is on the phone with founders from 5 am to 11 pm and same thing with other members of the team.\u201d\n\nExpert Dojo\u2019s inaugural Africa cohort is only the beginning of its plans in Africa. The hope is that they will start an Africa-only fund in the near future.\n\nShare this article",

Here are five key numbers from the report: Out of 716 fintech companies pooled across Africa, only 37 have achieved scale. 20 out of those 37 companies are headquartered in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. On average, it takes 12 years for a African fintech company to scale; only 5 startups have managed to scale within 5 years of operations.\n\nOlanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Also, those 37 include \u2018fintech\u2019 units launched by Airtel and MTN. So we really only have 4% scale prevalence in African fintech.\n\nThese numbers are not pretty. Is Africa not a huge market populated by young people with internet-enabled smartphones? Why are the fintech companies serving them not scaling? The report gives two explanations: Fragmentation: Many tech companies have not overcome the complex aspects of implementing their ideas in practice. A major complexity is the existence of different (and sometimes harsh) regulations from one country to another. Low-income: How many people can pay for the services being offered? An \u201caddressable market\u201d is demand \u2013 the number of people \u201cwilling and able to pay\u201d \u2013 not population. Goodwill may attract but it is self-interest that converts. Putting it bluntly, the report states that \u201cscaling a business that serves lower income tiers is notoriously hard.\u201d It\u2019s a reality check for those who dream of capturing the next billion from Africans at the bottom of the pyramid. Beware of \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d apps. However, it\u2019s not all bad news. One interesting takeaway is that \u201cinfrastructure\u201d fintech companies are likely to scale in Africa. Olanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights Infrastructure fintechs, according to the report, are those providing payment gateways, building banking-as-a-service applications or aggregating services into APIs. Of the 96 fintech companies defined as being in the sub-sector, 10% have scaled. Interswitch, MFS Africa and Fawry probably typify the infrastructure fintechs but I am surprised that certain names are not listed among the scaled in this sub-sector. Is a multimillion-dollar acquisition not a signal of scale? How about a presence in 30 countries with over $50m in annual revenue? The researchers explain their methodology in the report. Whatever those answers, the important thing to note is that companies building the rails for other services (financial and non-financial) in Africa are likely to expand quickly. But scale is not just for B2B fintechs. Carbon and Branch, two digital lending companies, make the case that it is possible to scale by serving consumers efficiently. Both have recently evolved to digital banks. Carbon staking out a claim to lead Buy Now Pay Later in Africa \u2013 in other words, to become infrastructure for lending. Perhaps another report with a different yardstick will reveal other scaled fintechs in Africa. For now, we can look deeper into the top 4% to see how they arrived where they currently are. Like McDonald\u2019s, did they all scale by owning land instead of burgers and fries? FROM THE CABAL In case you missed these:\n\n\n\nSenegal will produce rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 from 2022, thanks to a tech transfer deal involving two major biotech companies. The technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from biotech companies to DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit in Dakar. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Olumide reveals that this is to tackle the lack of access to early-stage funding for African tech companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more: Early Paystack investor, Olumide Soyombo launches Pan-African VC firm, Voltron Capital.\n\nIn 2020, the African tech scene saw the launch of VC firms, like Future Africa and Sherpa Ventures, focused on seed and pre-seed funding.\n\nThe importance of early-stage funding cannot be overstated. African startups need this capital to accelerate growth, bolster operations, and, most importantly, generate revenue. The major impediments include a disorganised network and gender parity.\n\nWith happenings like the Voltron Capital launch and Magic Fund\u2019s raise of $30 million to support early-stage founders across Africa and four other regions, more early-stage focused investments is a prospect worth entertaining.\n\nPan-African proptech startup, Spleet, gets into MetaProp Accelerator Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-L: Akintola Adesanmi & Dolapo Adebayo, Spleet Co-founders\n\nWhat happened? An African-focused proptech startup, Spleet, has been selected for the MetaProp 2021 Accelerator Program set to take place at the University of Columbia.\n\nWhat about it? Well, the accelerator program begins in September and will run in a hybrid format. Participants will be offered $250,000 in funding plus a 22-week mentorship course in the global real estate tech space.\n\nApplication into the MetaProp Accelerator program is ongoing for proptech startups and closes on July 30, 2021.\n\nSpleet is a Nigeria-based proptech startup. Currently available in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, the platform launched in August 2017, and allows people seeking accommodation to find homes with flexible rent payment options, and also provides apartments for individuals via its quasi-Airbnb system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoom out. Africa\u2019s proptech space urgently needs accelerators to step in and address its challenges, including shortage of housing facilities, renters\u2019 limited finances, and high rents.\n\nRemember this? Why solving Nigeria\u2019s housing problem is beyond proptech startups for now\n\nConsidering this, MetaProp Co-founder Zach Aaron believes that having Spleet as a Nigerian proptech in New York for the program is a way for the African startup to interact with global real estate players.\n\nHopefully, via this interaction, the company gains tremendous insight from the global proptech space and, in turn, models an example for other proptech startups in Africa.\n\nInsurtech startup, Pineapple, secures $3.4m Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPineapple\u2019s co-founders, L-R: Ndabenhle Junior Ngulube, Marnus van Heerden, and Matthew Elan Smith\n\nWhat happened?

          "text": "As the access to housing finance becomes uneasy to developers and foreign direct investments (FDIs) are drying up due to rising insecurity and the Covid-19 induced downturn in the global economy lingers, experts point to other ways to increase housing supply and reduce the deficit.\n\nPotential sources of funding for housing, including deposit money banks (DMBs), private equity, pension funds administrators (PFAs), which have over N12 trillion assets under management, are unwilling to invest in the sector despite the huge opportunities.\n\n\u201cWith over N12.2 trillion of Assets Under Management, which makes it an excellent candidate for improving liquidity in the housing sector, PFAs don\u2019t invest due to regulatory restraints by PENCOM,\u201d explained Ify Umunakwe-Okeke, CEO, Lexon Capital, UK.\n\nUmunakwe-Okeke who spoke on \u2018Housing Finance in Post Covid-19 Era: Lessons and Opportunities for Emerging Markets\u2019 at the ongoing Abuja International Housing Conference, added that PFAs don\u2019t invest in housing because they seek a better return on investment.\n\nThe same reason, she said, explains why private equity funds avoid investment in housing.\n\nChudi Ubosi had, at a separate occasion, explained that, though it is permissible for them to invest in asset-backed securities, including REITs, mortgage, bonds, and mortgage-backed securities, PFAs shy away from real estate investment because the assets are not liquid.\n\nRead also: Opportunity opens as govt reinstates $500,000 EB-5 investment for US residency\n\nUmunakwe added that in real estate, there is inadequate transparency, multiple taxations and poor valuation standards, although estate surveyors and valuers would discountenance this assumption.\n\nShe said that in the absence of these funding sources, housing developers could increase supply through multiple ways such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) which includes affordable housing in exchange for land allocation, establishing and implementing monetary and fiscal policies to stimulate rapid economic recovery.\n\nOther ways are lower interest rates for developers and purchasers, easier access to construction funding on less restrictive terms, a housing fund targeted at developers that will help bridge the liquidity gap, and encouraging local manufacturing of building materials, fixtures and fittings.\n\nIncreasing the earnings of salaried workers in the public sector and getting people on the housing ladder earlier, plus revitalising technical schools to boost the supply of skilled and semi-skilled labour force are also ways to reduce the housing deficit, according to Umunakwe-Okeke.\n\nShe also recommended adopting the financing options available to prospective homeowners, especially first home buyers, in the UK\n\nThe first of such options is the Mortgage Guarantee Scheme which helps to increase the supply of mortgages for borrowers who have just a 5 percent deposit. Another is the Help-to-Buy option with the government lending buyers up to 20 percent of the purchase price of a new build home.\n\nBuyers, according to her, could also go for Shared Ownership Schemes; First Homes Scheme which helps first-time buyers and key workers to buy their homes at a discount of at least 30 percent; Right-to-Buy, which is a government scheme set up to help eligible council tenants buy their rented home at a discount, and Stamp Duty waivers or deferred payments.\n\nThere is, however, good news coming from Shelter Afrique, a pan Africa housing finance organization, which says it is poised to support large and affordable housing schemes through the issuance of a $250 billion bond.\n\nAndrew Chimphondah, the CEO of the company, who disclosed this in his presentation at the conference, added that the organization has a role to play in attending to affordable housing delivery and urban development in Africa, Nigeria inclusive.\n\nChimphomdah assured that the organization would be releasing a range of financing facilities to support the delivery of affordable housing and also to stimulate demand.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s cotton industry is fast sliding towards extinction on account of a shrinking local market and low seeds available to farmers, despite the incentives of an alluring $3 trillion global industry.\n\nMore so, many of Nigeria\u2019s cotton farmers have shifted to growing other crops. Stakeholders have attributed the decline in cotton production to low-quality key inputs such as seeds, inadequate finance for farmers, and the death of the country\u2019s textile industry.\n\nNigeria\u2019s cotton production is put at 51,000 metric tonnes on 253,000 hectares, with an average yield of 202kg per hectare, while global cotton consumption is put at 24 million metric tonnes, according to International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) 2016 data.\n\nCotton, which used to be one of Nigeria\u2019s major cash crops in the \u201970s was not even among the top 19 agricultural commodities exported in 2020 full year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show.\n\n\u201cA lot of farmers are no longer growing cotton because of low patronage and lack of inputs. The inputs we get from the government usually come very late. When you delay in planting cotton, it affects the productivity,\u201d said Abubakar Shiyaki, a cotton farmer in Niger state.\n\nRead also: Ogun restates commitment to cotton farmers\n\n\u201cWhen we buy our seeds ourselves, we only buy low-quality seeds. As a result of all these challenges, a lot of farmers growing cotton are now growing other crops because they cannot break even with cotton,\u201d Shiyaki said.\n\nThe Federal Government had in 2017 proposed a budget of N51 billion to promote the development of the country\u2019s garment and textile industry.\n\nData from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment show that between 1980 and 2016, about 145 companies operating in the textile sector had shut down, due to policy somersaults, poor research, and development (R&D), lack of competition in the supply of cotton (raw materials), smuggling and poor power supply, among others.\n\nSalmanu Abdullahi, chairman, Ginners Association of Nigeria, said \u201cthe total collapse of cotton production was as a result of government neglect of agriculture. We however believe that things would be different now that there is a renewed commitment to the sector.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs to also address the issue of seeds so that farmers can improve their yields,\u201d said Abdullahi.\n\nStakeholders have blamed the failure to increase cotton output on ineffective government structures that do not allow effective and efficient translation of technology between research institutes and cotton farmers.\n\nIbrahim Umar Abubakar, director, Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) Zaria said, \u201cthe failure of extension service delivery in the country has contributed to the failure of cotton farmers. Farmers need to be trained on good handling practice, modern farming techniques, and technology.\u201d\n\nDespite the ban of forex to importers of textile in Africa\u2019s most populous country in 2019 and the introduction of two varieties of biotech cotton in commercial quantities in 2018, the country has not seen a significant market for its cotton or increase in production.\n\nSimilarly, the Central Bank has disbursed about N44billion to cotton farmers as a way of revamping the sector. This has brought about a marginal increase in cotton production as importation continues to be on the rise.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) trade report, importation of textile and textile articles rose year-on-year by 257.9 percent in the first three months of 2021 to N171.8 billion from N48billion in the same period of 2020.\n\n\u201cThere is still not an adequate market for cotton in the country despite most of us are returning to the cultivation of the crop since the government distributed improved seed varieties for us in 2018,\u201d Ibrahim Isa, a cotton farmer in Kano said in a telephone response to questions.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe rate of drug abuse in Nigeria, particularly among the youths is assuming an alarming dimension.\n\nA recent data released by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), showed that over 20 million Nigerians are involved in drug abuse out of which 60 per cent are youths.\n\nMostly involved are youths in higher institutions and in the entertainment sector.\n\nDr Obi Adagwu, an expert on drug control, explained that the resurgence of drug use among the youths is due to poor enforcement and inadequate policy to curtail it.\n\n\u201cHow many drug rehabilitation centres exist in the country? The few we have, how effective are they?\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the war against drug abuse should start from homes, as most parents who are supposed to be mentors do not monitor their children.\n\n\u201cSome parents do not even know at what point their children got involved with drugs.\n\n\u201cThe fight against drug abuse should also be taken to government offices, there are so many government officials abusing drugs,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAdagwu who is a psychologist, also blamed the government for not giving sufficient support to agencies with the mandate to check drug abuse.\n\nNDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, who spoke on the efforts of the agency to tackle drug abuse, said that over 400 suspects and large quantities of drugs were intercepted in the past few months by officials of the agency from various routes, including airports.\n\nAccording to him, over 200 cases are at various stages of prosecution.\n\n\u201c We solicit media support and other Nigerians to give information to the agency, no effort shall be spared to rid the country of illicit drugs, \u2018\u2019he added.\n\nMr James Ojomo, an expert in drug abuse, says many of the major towns including Kano, Kaduna, Abuja and Lagos are veritable grounds for drug abusers.\n\n\u201c For some time, the country was not serious in waging war against drug abuse, as we were treating it with kid grooves.\n\n\u201cIllicit drug users and its barons were having a field day, turning the country into a destination route rather than a transit.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing restructuring of NDLEA, and a new henchman in the person of Buba Marwa, the agency has been rejuvenated and the war has just begun,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOjomo says that what is expected from the rest of us is to give information and expose barons amongst us that are threatening to destroy our youths and the future of the country.\n\nSome concerned Nigerians say that over the years, successive regimes in Nigeria had taken steps to improve the country\u2019s reputation as an international drug trafficking centre.\n\nAccording to them, most of the emphasis had fallen on law enforcement and repression, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of arrests and prison population.\n\nIn spite of such severe measures, experts say a correlative fall in drug consumption has not been witnessed.\n\nThey added that with the renewed effort by the NDLEA and support from the Federal Government, the war against drug abuse will be tackled and won in no distant time.\n\nThey also stressed the need to strengthen the law against drug use.\n\nProf. Isiodore Obot, the Director, Centre for Research and Information on Substance Abuse, said that Nigeria had failed in its drug war, considering the large number of youths involved in drug usage and abuse.\n\nObot, who spoke at the Youthrise Nigeria Drug Policy Training for media practitioners recently in Abuja, said in spite criminalising drug use for many years, this had not achieved its goal of eliminating drug production and use.\n\nAccording to him, the nation\u2019s perspective about drugs from a criminal justice system perspective needs to be changed to healthcare system perspective.\n\nObot, who is also a psychologist, declared that drug use was much more than a criminal issue, but one with many health and social implications, including fighting, violence, among others.\n\nHe said drug use cuts across all social classes and gender, adding that what may be different is what type of drug they are using.\n\nHe listed illegal drugs commonly used as cannabis sativa, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants and inhalants and solvents such as glue.\n\nProf. Mojisola Adeyeye, the Director-General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), attributed the high rate of drug abuse to lack of control of prescribed drugs, among others.\n\nAdeyeye who spoke at an event to mark the 2020 International Drug Awareness Day in Abuja, said other factors responsible for drug abuse are the love for money by peddlers, unemployment, disobedience to the laws of the land.\n\nOther reasons she identified as responsible for drug abuse are smuggling substances through our porous seaports and land borders, corruption and light penalties for the sellers and traffickers.\n\nAccording to her, the only way to check abuse is for the government to develop and enforce a National Prescription Policy.\n\nAdeyeye appealed to the three arms of government not to relent on its efforts in the fight against drug abuse, stressing that they have a major role to play by putting in place, stiffer penalties, that are commensurate with the offences of drug abuse.\n\nShe called on ministries, departments and agencies, religious bodies, educational institutions and parents to join hands with government in the fight against drug abuse.\n\nWhile identifying drugs like tramadol and codeine as the most commonly abused drugs in the country, the NAFDAC D-G had this to say: \u201cTramadol is a synthetic analgesic used to treat moderate to severe pains and is the most abused medicine among addicts.\n\n\u201cTramadol and codeine are regulated as 50mg and 100mg dosage strengths, but very high dosage forms of 200mg and 225 mg have infiltrated the market,\u201d she added.\n\nShe advised youths in the country to desist from drug abuse as it portends very high risks such as arrhythmias, cramps, coma, and death.\n\n\u201cWe need to rescue our youths from the use of illicit drugs, to achieve this, all hands must be on deck, relevant agencies must work together,\u2019\u2019 she emphasised.\n\n_________________________\n\nJulius Enehikhuere, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA former United Kingdom-based trader for Glencore Plc, Anthony Stimler, on Monday pleaded guilty over what prosecutors in the United States described as his role in a scheme to bribe officials in Nigeria in exchange for favourable contracts from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.\n\nBloomberg reports that Mr Stimler admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and commit money laundering at a hearing in Manhattan federal court conducted by video.\n\nProsecutors said millions of dollars in bribes were paid to officials in Nigeria, in exchange for NNPC awarding oil contracts and providing \u201cmore lucrative grades of oil on more favorable delivery terms.\u201d\n\nReports said that court papers refer to seven alleged co-conspirators from several countries in the bribery scheme, which prosecutors said ran from 2007 to 2018.\n\nNone of them was, however, charged or identified by name.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Glencore confirmed that Mr Stimler had been an employee. The Anglo-Swiss mining company and one of the world\u2019s largest commodity traders also said it has cooperated with probes by the U.S. Department of Justice and other authorities.\n\n\u201cThe conduct described in the plea is unacceptable and has no place in Glencore,\u201d the company said.\n\nMr Stimler worked on Glencore\u2019s West Africa desk from around 2002 to 2009 and again from around 2011 to 2019, court papers show. He will remain free in the United Kingdom on a $500,000 bond, according to Bloomberg, even as his lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nEarlier in March, former Glencore oil trader Emilio Jose Heredia Collado pleaded guilty in San Francisco to manipulating a key oil price benchmark.\n\nThe Justice Department has been investigating Glencore\u2019s business dealings in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo. U.K. and Swiss authorities have also been examining possible corruption involving Glencore, and various governments have investigated other large oil traders.\n\nThe spokesperson of Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil company, NNPC, Kennie Obateru, did not return a phone call as of press time Tuesday morning.",

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle, Abeokuta\n\nOgun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun has attributed the late conduct of the local government elections in the state to the outbreak of the dreaded COVID \u2013 19 pandemic.\n\nThe governor cleared the air yesterday in Abeokuta while inaugurating the newly elected Chairmen and Councillors at the just concluded local government polls in the state.\n\nPrince Dapo Abiodun\u2019s clarification came amid criticisms over his administration\u2019s alleged lackluster attitude to dissolve local government transition committees in the state and replace them with duly elected council members.\n\n\u201cWe could have done this earlier but for the outbreak of COVID-19 and the need to adhere strictly to the Prevention Protocols\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe noted that the leadership of his party, the All Progressives Congress \u201cabhors vacuum\u201d at the and Local Government Administration level, hence the appointment of the transition chairmen.\n\nAccording to the governor, to take charge of local government administration \u201cwe inaugurated Local Government Transition Committees on Friday, 17th January, 2020 with a view to conducting a properly organised election within the shortest possible time. But the pandemic that struck in our State on 27th February of last year made this unrealisable, hence the transition committees\u2019 stay in office for 18 months\u201d\n\nThe governor however expressed joy that many of the transition committees acquitted themselves creditably in the discharge of the assignment given them.\n\nHe explained that his administration set up the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission, OGSIEC, as a demonstration of its resolve to provide a conducive environment for the conduct of free and fair election at the third-tier of government, according to Section 7(1) of the 1999 constitution.\n\nPrince Abiodun who posited that some people may not understand the seriousness that was attached to the conduct of the local government elections, congratulated all the newly elected Chairmen of the 20 Local Government Areas in the State on their respective electoral successes.\n\n\u201cFor one, I commend you for stepping out to make yourselves available for service and most especially, for the entrenchment of good governance at the grassroots level,\u201d the governor said, urging them to appreciate the fact that their victory at the polls was multidimensional.\n\n\u201cIt is a combination of the confidence reposed in your individual abilities; the faith the people have reposed in our great party, the All Progressive Congress (APC) to provide the needed development and ensure individual prosperity for our people at the grassroots. It is a call to service,\u201d he said.\n\nHe enjoined them to appreciate the enormity of the responsibility their victory places on their shoulders, stressing \u201ctherefore, your assumption of office must bring a new vista of development to our people at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cIn doing this, you must be inclusive; you must be transparent; you must be accountable; you must be fair; you must be just; you must be equitable; you must obey the rule of law; you must provide good governance; you must be judicious,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nWhile reminding the newly elected Council executives not to turn themselves to \u201cMr or Mrs I know it All,\u201d he equally told them that they must understand that they could not rely exclusively on allocations from the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYou will have to be creative in generating funds internally, and incorporate the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) model,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201d But in doing this, you cannot afford to over-burden the people who are the essence and facilitators of your being in power. You should take a cue from our approach at the State level by being cerebral; methodical; systemic and ensure strategic allocation of funds.\u201d\n\nHe, however, assured them that his administration at the state level would continue to support local government administrations with funds where and when necessary.\n\n\u201cOur Administration will continue to formulate policies and implement programmes that are people-friendly. We expect you to replicate same at your level. All these will further bring to fruition the successful implementation of the \u2018Building our Future Together Agenda.\u2019 I expect that you will take a cue from us and implement your own Local Government brand of I.S.E.Y.A.\u201d the governor emphasized.\n\nHe called on the people of the State, particularly at the Local Government level to hold the Council Chairmen to account.\n\n\u201cYou have voted them in. You should also ensure that you continue to give them suggestions on how to improve the lots of the people in their areas,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cWe must understand that the democratic process does not end at electing representatives but also in helping them to do what we have elected them to do.\u201d\n\nThe governor assured that his administration would continue to respect the autonomy of the local government and give them necessary support to carry out their constitutional responsibilities.",

At one point in the second quarter, they ripped off a 23-0 run and built a double-digit lead at the break.

James Akpanudoedehe, also stated that the APC would continue to support constitutionally backed innovations by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to make the country\u2019s elections more credible.\n\nThe statement, which was the party\u2019s reaction to an earlier communiqu\u00e9 issued by the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum at the end of its meeting Monday in Bauchi State, carpeted the opposition for what the ruling party termed \u201cidle conspiracy theories on the state of the nation and the PDP\u2019s pitiable attempt to explain its failed state as the supposed main opposition party in the country.\u201d According to the statement, the APC noted that though it was indeed remarkable that the PDP has finally opened up to its fast depleting fortunes, it, however, advised that the PDP concentrates on redemption instead of blaming the APC or anyone else for its rudderless state. It said, \u201cWe reiterate that it is foolhardy for the PDP to expect its members to sink with the party in the face of its failed state. The PDP should quickly address itself to the fact that its members and leaders who are joining the APC in droves are attracted and inspired by the progressive leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari government and the internal democracy being entrenched by the leadership of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). \u201c\n\nThe APC stressed that it was resolved to entrench internal democracy in all its decision making processes, particularly party nomination through direct and indirect primaries or consensus.\n\nThe ruling party maintained that the Permanent Voters\u2019 Card, PVC, remains the only legal instrument voters can use to elect progressive leaders who can sustain the ongoing efforts of APC governments at the Federal, State, and Local Government Areas to sustain its successes in renewing national infrastructure, transforming agriculture and diversifying the economy.\n\nIt, therefore, urged well-meaning Nigerians to take advantage of the ongoing Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s (INEC) Continuous Voter Registration exercise to register.",

Non-compliance with their directives constitutes a risk to national health security and will be handled with commensurate severity.\u201d\n\nOsagie noted that the world has witnessed an increase in reported cases of COVID-19 across a significant number of countries, due to the high transmissibility of the Delta Variant.\n\nHe explained that the threat included importation from countries that were popular travel destinations for Nigerians, including the United Kingdom, United States, UAE, France, and Turkey, which have a high incidence of the virulent strain.\n\nPush For Vaccine Sufficiency\n\nThe minister decried that COVID-19 treatment bed occupancy was also recording an increase given the established emergence of a third wave.\n\nIn preparation, he hinted that the government has taken steps to urgently scale up and enhance local oxygen capacity even before oxygen consumption increases.\n\nAccording to Osagie, Nigeria is a well-traversed country and is susceptible to further importation of the virus, especially when there is clear evidence that the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has begun across the African continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at increased risk if we continue to neglect public health protocols placed at points of entry, which are our first line of defence and a critical point of concern,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe minister stated that Nigeria has invested directly and strategically in ensuring oxygen availability to avert unforeseen incidence of oxygen insufficiency for COVID-19 patients in the country.\n\nOn the push for COVID-19 vaccine sufficiency, he said the country was expecting over 29 million Johnson & Johnson vaccines purchased by the government through the African Union AVATT facility; as well as over four million Moderna and almost 700,000 AstraZeneca vaccines through the COVAX facility from bilateral donations from the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, with Pfizer and Sinopharm from both bilateral agreements and through the COVAX facility.\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson vaccine, which is a one-dose vaccine, will be advantageous for our context with weak Civil Registration Vital Statistics (CRVS) and a nomadic population.\n\n\u201cWe expect to take delivery of these vaccines within this third quarter with the Johnson & Johnson expected this August,\u201d Osagie hinted.",

          "text": "The Federal Government will end most of its electricity subsidy payments, estimated at N30 billion per month, beginning next year.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Monday at the opening of the 14th Nigerian Association for Energy Economics/IAEE conference in Abuja that the government expected the power sector to generate its revenue.\n\nThe conference\u2019s theme is \u201cStrategic responses of the energy sector to the consequences of COVID-19 on African economies.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo, who was represented by the Special Assistant to the President on Infrastructure, Engr. Ahmad Zakari, stated that the government would invest more than $3 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure across the country in the coming years.\n\nHe explained that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration\u2019s efforts to restructure the energy sector would ensure that it continues to play an important role in the country\u2019s social and economic development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u201cElectricity tariff reforms with service-based tariff has led to collections from the electricity sector by 63 per cent, increasing revenue assurance for gas producers and stabilizing the value chain.\n\n\u201cIt is anticipated that all electricity market revenues will be obtained from the market with limited subsidy from next year as reforms in metering and efficiency with the DISCOs continue to improve.\n\n\u201cAccelerated investment in transmission and distribution, over $3 billion will be out into this sub-segment of the electricity value chain that will put us on the path to delivering 10 gigawatts through the interventions of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Siemens partnership, World Bank and Africa Development Bank, and others.\u201d\n\nHe said as the electricity sector continued to be stabilized, more power was needed for the country\u2019s large population.\n\n\u201cThat is why this administration continues to invest in generation to cater for our current and future needs,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOsinbajo charged the participants to come up with solutions to key energy challenges facing the country, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic and energy transition.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, pointed out that the COVID-19 which took the world by surprise in 2020, had grave impact on the energy sector.\n\nOn her part, the President of NAEE, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe, warned that energy transition and movement towards net zero carbon was real, stressing that Nigeria must take steps to align itself with global trend.\n\n\u201cFor some, change represents a move away from the warm and welcoming familiar, towards fearful horizons characterised by uncertainty.\n\n\u201cHowever, a critical consideration of this season will show that it is a period when change cannot be stopped or hijacked, and that survivors will be those with the ability to adapt. It is here to stay for the time being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor African countries, which have the problem of low levels of access to modern energy services, and which have no option but to grow their energy industries, this presents a very interesting and-to me- exciting challenge.\n\n\u201cAfrica abounds in energy resources- coal, bitumen, crude oil, natural gas, solar energy, wind, tidal and wave energy, geothermal energy etc. The continent is blessed. Unfortunately, these resources have so far not been harnessed so as to unlock their vast potentials for the use of the people.\n\nIn his remarks, the Executive Secretary of Petroleum Technology Development Fund, PTDF, Engr. Bello Gusau, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had had great impact on the economies of African countries, especially those that relied on the export of crude oil.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in Nigeria, where the oil sector accounts for half of government\u2019s revenue and 90 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, GDP growth for oil has not been recovering as expected, a trend that could potentially have negative implications for quick economic recovery in a post-COVID-19 era,\u201d he added.",

In June, he described the food situation as \u201ctense\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know North Korea has been reeling from the pandemic over the past year,\u201d Soo Kim, a former CIA North Korea analyst who now works at the Rand Corporation told Reuters news agency. \u201cThat, combined with sanctions, natural disasters, and an overall decrepit economy, likely put Kim Jong Un in dire straits. So perhaps Kim is looking to Seoul to help bail him out of this \u2018tense\u2019 food situation and other baggage resulting from the pandemic.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea cut the hotline in June 2020 as cross-border ties soured after a failed second summit in February 2019 between Kim and Donald Trump, who was then president of the United States.\n\nMoon, who has long sought warmer relations with Pyongyang and is credited with brokering the initial summit between Kim and Trump in June 2018 \u2013 the first ever involving a sitting US president \u2013 has called for a recovery of the hotline and stalled denuclearisation talks.\n\nJoe Biden, who took over as US president in January, has promised a change of approach to North Korean and a more \u201cpractical, calibrated\u201d policy.\n\nNorth Korea cut communication links in June last year blaming the South for not doind enough to stop activists from sending propaganda balloons across the border [File: South Korea Unification Ministry via AP Photo]\n\nSung Kim, the top US diplomat in charge of North Korea negotiations, said in June that Washington was ready to meet officials from Pyongyang \u201canywhere, anytime, without preconditions\u201d.\n\nBut Kim Yo Jong \u2013 Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister and a key adviser \u2013 rebuffed the offer.\n\nAnalysts say Tuesday\u2019s surprise restoration of the inter-Korean hotlines could be seen as a sign of Kim\u2019s response to Washington.\n\n\u201cIt looks like he has decided that restoring inter-Korean relations is beneficial to the North\u2019s both domestic and foreign policies and politics,\u201d Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told AFP news agency.\n\nDespite the standstill in talks, Moon has relentlessly stressed the importance of restoring inter-Korean ties, he added. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.\n\n\u201cThis should be read as Kim Jong Un\u2019s first response to Seoul and Washington,\u201d Yang said.",
