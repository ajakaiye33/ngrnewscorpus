          "title": "2023: Stop recycling leaders who have nothing to offer \u2013 Ex- DSS Asst Director warns Nigerians",
          "text": ".\n\nA retired Assistant Director of the State Service, Dennis Amachree has called on Nigerians to kick against recycling of leaders, whose families have been in the political space for years and have nothing to show for it, and as such, a new Nigeria of hope cannot emerge.\n\nAmachree who was the guest speaker of the Afrikanwatch Network annual lecture titled, A New Nigeria, with innovative ideology, devoid of hypocritical leaders, which was held at the College Hall of Yaba College of Technology, Lagos stressed that the current politicians lack the ideology to give birth to a new Nation.\n\nHe went further to examine which kind of leaders Nigeria has had since independence from Britain and asked whether Nigeria had been led or ruled since independence? \u201cMention one president that actually led this country, and think of how many rulers Nigeria have got, at the presidential level, since independence\u201d.\n\nA political aspirant recently said that he will turn Nigeria around if he is allowed to \u201cRULE.\u201d So it is very apparent that most of our politicians see the opportunity of public service as a chance to RULE over the \u201cslaves\u201d or \u201csubjects\u201d of Nigeria. But alas, Nigeria is not a monarchy to be ruled over; neither are we slaves in our own country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking hypocritical leadership, he hinted that most of the country\u2019s politicians say one thing, but do something else. \u201cNigerians are used to all the campaign promises of what they will do for the populace but continue to behave in a different way.\n\nUnder such leadership, the citizens can see barefaced corruption, nepotism, unimaginable fraud and total disappearance of integrity. Nigerians have been caught up in the quagmire of hypocritical leadership, where we are at the mercy of the politicians.\n\nIn a democratic system, where \u201cWe the People\u201d are supposed to be the repository of power, politicians have relegated the citizens to the background where, if a politician built five kilometres of road, we come out with our drums, dancing and thanking the governor or president for providing that infrastructure, as if he built the road with his own personal money.\n\nIt is simple, the citizens beating the drums are ignorant and the politician is taking advantage of their lack of knowledge\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a truism that most of the politicians today are ignorant of or devoid of leadership skills and qualities. Very few politicians do understand what leadership is all about. But most politicians are in public office to appropriate our commonwealth into their personal pockets. That is why \u201cLeadership for development\u201d becomes a big problem. A big problem because the fundamental objectives of being in public office are not for development but for personal aggrandizement\u201d\n\nAmachree reiterated that the political landscape in Nigeria lacks cognitive rigidity when it comes to ideology.\n\n\u201cIdeological extremism is totally shady, where carpet crossing is a commonality.\n\nIn the United States, the Democrats are pro-choice (support abortion), while their Republican counterparts are totally against abortion. In such rigidly held beliefs or ideologies, It is rare to see politicians crossing the carpet. But in Nigeria, it\u2019s easy to cross the carpet because there are no ideologies or strongly held beliefs that can change the conviction of a Republican to be a Democrat overnight or vice versa.\n\nThe recent outcome of the All Progressive Congress (APC) convention is instructive. If you observe carefully, most of the principal officers of the APC, are decampees of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP)? This simply means that there is no ideology that both parties hold very dear. If the political benefits get bad in the APC, don\u2019t be surprised to see the same politician decamp back to the PDP. In concluding his lecture, he said, a New Nigeria can be realized if only insecurity can disappear, giving an example of the turnaround of the wrecked economy of Greece, Singapore Malaysia, Vietnam and Rwanda on the African country. A demonstrative leader\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria can turn around by taking advantage of the low-hanging fruits. We must stop the jamboree going on in Abuja. It is insane for us to be paying 469 federal legislators the highest salaries in the world. Our professors and medical doctors are migrating to other developed countries because this country does not value their contribution to the nation, as compared to legislators; some who don\u2019t utter a word during sessions but smile to the bank at the end of each month.\n\nWe need leaders that will grow the country. Leaders who understand the meaning of \u201cService\u201d in Public Service, Finally, every public servant must be held accountable by being monitored with strict Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Private companies succeed hopefully, together we will birth the Nigeria of our dreams\u201d\n\nOn his part, the chairman of the occasion, Col. Barr. Abayomi Dare retd reminded Nigerians of the political rascality and abuse of power and corruption that has kept the country in the darkest mood but believed that after the rain, the sun will shine \u201cThe impunity with which the rule of law is disregarded, the injustice faced by the lowly, the inability of the legislative to call to order the unruly acts of executive and vice versa, have destroyed the hope of many for a better Nigeria. The terror attacks from Nigerians \u2013 turned rebels against their motherland, with the support of foreign entities, have diminished the desires of many to stay and build the nation.\n\nThe Nigerian economy is being exploited by serial looters in government and private organizations, leaving the nation burdened with debt servicing and serial borrowing by successive administrations. Backed by unstable policies, with no long-term vision for investors, Nigeria stands on the brink of becoming an economically failed state.\n\nBut in all of these, Col. Dare retd holds strongly that a better Nigeria can arise from the ashes of all that have besieged and have placed the nation in comatose. But, it begins with you and paying rapt attention to all that will be discussed here today, and in other progressive gatherings. Also, the father of the day, Otunba Bamidele Dada, OON, has stated that Nigeria needs leaders who can uphold the rule of law and the ethic diversities. \u201cIn line with the Theme of this Event-New Nigeria- I should like to emphasize the importance of good leadership at different levels of our society.\n\nWhat Nigeria needs today are leaders who uphold and respect the law! If we are to succeed as a Nation, and with \u2018Nation-building\u2019, we must have leadership committed to the rule of law and a visible sense of equity, fair play and tolerance. We must have leaders with a reflective sense of tomorrow, other than that of private bank account enrichment and material acquisition.\n\nMeanwhile, the editor-in-Chief of the Afrikanwatch, Mark Orgu said, that the idea of the event was to chart a new course for a new Nigeria, noting however that the country is serious bleeding, and only leaders with a conscience are what the country needs in 2023.",

          "text": "BY DAMILOLA OGUNSAKIN\n\nNigerian man, Kunle Adeyanju who embarked on a \u201ccharity ride\u201d from London, the UK, to Lagos, has revealed that Mauritania is not a country he wants to visit again for anything.\n\n\n\nThe entrepreneur and author embarked on the journey on April 19 and on Day 13, he tweeted that he had arrived in St. Louis, Senegal, from Mauritania after crossing the Sahara Desert through Morocco.\n\nOn day 14, Kunle via his Twitter account, shared some of his uneventful experiences of the adventure so far.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the Police, Immigration and Customs in Mauritania all worked together as a cartel to extort and make life hell for foreigners.\n\nHe went further to say he had visited over 75 countries around the world, and can categorically say that Mauritania is the worst of all the countries.\n\nRead some of tweets:\n\n\u2018\u2019The experiences of the last two days had been the only uneventful experiences of this adventure so far. And all the unpleasant experiences happened in Mauritania.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019And this cuts across the two major cities in the country and their two major border.\n\n\u201cThe unpleasant experiences were not due to anything act of God or issues beyond my control, but entirely the wickedness and evil of men to men.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019I have visited over 75 countries around the world, and I can categorically say that Mauritania is the worse of all the countries I have experienced.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The people are unfriendly, they are mean and all they think about when they see you as a foreigner is what they can grab, forcefully, deceitfully or cunningly from you.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019I visited the two major cities in the country \u2014 Nouakchott and Nouadhibou \u2014 and also passed through the two most popular border crossinga in the country and terrible experiences were all the same in all these places.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019I later learned that the country re-denominated its currency some months back, by knocking off one zero from the exchange rate.\n\n\u201dAn example; the Euro used to change for 1euro = 400um, when they redenominated, it became 1euro = 40.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019However, the whole country still fraudulently sell things to foreigners at the old rate, thereby charging you 10 times more for purchases. And this cuts across all aspect of their economy in patronised, hotel, restaurant, fuel station and government agencies.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019At the border, the Immigration, Police, Custom and other security agency there will refuse to engaged you, but compel you to go through their touts whom they use to defraud unsuspecting foreigners.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019And this experience was not with the security agencies at the border alone, it cuts across all aspect of the economy I interacted with.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt a restaurant, hotel, fuel station it was all the same. And all through I just kept wondering why everything is so expensive here.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The Police, Immigration, Customs all worked together as a cartel to extort and make life hell for foreigners. In the heat of all these problems I had not choice but to part with $300.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019To me Mauritania is the worst shit-hole anyone can be, and a place I never want to visit again, even before the final episode of the day-light robbery.\n\n\u2018\u2019I didn\u2019t take any picture in the whole 200km ride from the capital Nouakchott to Rosso, not because I didn\u2019t want to take a shot, but because there was nothing to worth capturing.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019All you see are dead carcases of camel, goats, donkey etc littering the sides of the road as if that is the only place there is a desert.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019In all my write ups, I usually don\u2019t dwell on the negative sides of things. I am always on the positive because I believe that is what we should shine the light on.\n\n\u2018\u2019But if I keep mute on these terrible experiences in Mauritania, it will be a disservice to humanity, it may continue to happen to other people, and coupled with the fact that this whole scam is perpetrated in all aspect of the economy on foreigners\n\n\u2018\u2019I experienced it in the hotel, restaurant, fuels station and government agencies.\n\n\u2018\u2019For me, Mauritania is not a country I ever want to visit again for anything. Honestly not in my opinion. It\u2019s next to hell.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has assured families of those kidnapped by bandits in the ill-fated Abuja-Kaduna train service of March 28 that efforts were on-going to ensure their safe return.\n\nThe president gave the assurance on Monday in Abuja when he hosted residents of the FCT who paid him Sallah homage.\n\nHe directed security agencies and the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to provide detailed information to families of the victims regularly saying government would explore every opportunity to secure their return alive and unhurt.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate this occasion with joy amidst friends and family members, we are fully conscious of the fact that many families in our country are in a state of fear and anxiety.\n\n\u201cThis is on account of the many captives held by terrorists against their will; including those taken away in the tragic attack of the Abuja-Kaduna train service.\n\n\u201cI have directed security agencies to ensure quick and safe recovery of all victims of kidnapping.\n\n\u201cI urge the Railway management to immediately set up a situation room for the coordination of the rescue mission and for a minute-by-minute engagement with families of the captives.\n\n\u201cThis should ease their pain and anxiety as we push the military to ensure their safe return to their families. My aim is to see all those in captivity safely rescued.\n\n\u201cLet me assure Nigerians that the bandits are just pushing their luck, but this is only for a while before they are finally crushed.\n\n\u201cThey are using civilians as human shields, thereby making it difficult to confront them directly,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to the president, bandits and terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, don\u2019t respect the rules of engagement and can resort to harming hostages when attacked.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack. It\u2019s a delicate situation that requires wisdom, caution and also patience.\n\n\u201cAny rescue operation that results in the death of any hostage cannot be deemed a success.\n\n\u201cGovernment doesn\u2019t want this kind of tragic outcome. It\u2019s a complex situation that demands proper handling.\n\n\u201cThe primary objective of any rescue operation is to free the hostages safely, unharmed and alive.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear, however, that defeating the terrorists and bandits requires more than weapons; we also need human intelligence which is necessary to frustrate terrorists\u2019 plans.\n\n\u201cThe people and community leaders should help our security officials with information about the activities or movements of criminal groups,\u2019\u2019 Buhari stressed.\n\nThe president urged Nigerians to create a hostile environment for criminals hiding in communities, admonishing that \u201cby protecting criminals from exposure, you are endangering your own security and the security of your own community.\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u201cNo criminal can thrive in an environment where he faces the risks of exposure by the people.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, a stronger synergy between security agencies and communities will make a huge difference in defeating banditry and terrorism.\n\nPresident Buhari allayed fears that bandits would grow to yet another big challenge as faced by the Boko Haram threat, assuring that the administration would not allow such to happen.\n\n\u201cThis administration has allocated huge resources to improve the capacity of our security forces by timely giving them adequate equipment and improving the welfare of personnel to boost their morale.\n\n\u201cAbuja has witnessed remarkable improvement in terms of security.\n\n\u201cIn the past, terrorists made it almost impossible to conduct our normal lives. Road barricades had overrun the capital city and people had to pray in fear because of the anxiety of terrorists\u2019 attacks.\n\n\u201cNo place in the FCT was beyond the terrorists. Not even the United Nations building; not even the Police Headquarters.\n\n\u201cToday, the situation is no longer so.\n\n\u201cWe have significantly weakened and crippled the capabilities of the Boko Haram terrorists so much that they no longer have the ability to seize, and occupy any Nigerian territory without being repelled by our gallant troops.\n\n\u201cOf course, we can\u2019t say that the terrorists are 100 per cent destroyed, but we have destroyed their ability to seize our territory.\n\n\u201cThis improvement in terms of significantly weakening the enemy is necessary for finally defeating them.\n\n\u201cThe rate at which the terrorists are giving up their weapons and surrendering to our troops is a significant and welcome development,\u2019\u2019 he told his visitors.\n\nThe president commended the FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello, for \u201cdiligently ensuring the capital city stays safe and attractive\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe also thanked FCT residents for visiting the Presidential Villa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you all to the Presidential Villa. As is the tradition, people pay homage to the president as part of events to mark the Sallah celebrations.\n\n\u201cI value these kinds of visits because they afford me the opportunity to interact directly with the people or with their representatives.\n\n\u201cI commend FCT residents for living in peace and harmony for years since the capital officially came into being,\u2019\u2019 the president said.\n\nPresident Buhari stated that the welfare of the people of Abuja and that of all Nigerians would continue to remain paramount in government\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cThe physical development of Abuja and the provisions of infrastructure is our priority.\n\n\u201cSince the coming of this administration, we have made the completion of abandoned and on-going projects our priority.\n\n\u201cFor Abuja to attract investors as its population expands exponentially, the provision of infrastructure is essential.\n\n\u201cA federal capital should answer its name and it cannot do so if it lacks the necessary infrastructure to accommodate and accelerate development.\n\n\u201cAbuja has expanded beyond the imagination of even its planners.\n\n\u201cThis expansion comes with great challenges. In line with its objectives to transform Abuja into a befitting modern city, the FCT administration under the minister, Mohammed Bello, has been doing a great job,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the completion of the Abuja Light Rail is one of the major projects embarked upon by his administration for inhabitants as development of infrastructure remains essential to economic growth.\n\nHe said government would continue to pay serious attention to internal and arterial roads to other states, and to electricity.\n\n\u201cOur priority is the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cThe Second Niger Bridge which has dragged on for years is now to be completed by this government in October this year,\u2019\u2019 Buhari added.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who was also present, expressed his gratitude to the president on behalf of all the invited guests for hosting the homage.\n\nHe recalled the last time such gathering was possible was in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe thank God Almighty for giving us back such opportunity. It also tells us that indeed everything and all belong to Almighty God.\n\n\u201cIf this programme had held at your residence, Mr President, it would not have taken this large people, I think that even COVID-19 has a silver lining; here we are with so many people who are able to come.\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect opportunity to thank God that our nation is together and united in spite of challenges faced which are not peculiar to our nation.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Almighty God, Mr President, for giving you all that you have required and life to continue to tackle these challenges and surmount them.\n\n\u201cI pray the Almighty God to help you and help our government to tackle every one of these challenges as we confront them,\u2019\u2019 Osinbajo said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of the FCT, Mohammed Bello, expressed gratitude to God and to the president for the opportunity to pay the traditional Sallah homage at the State House.\n\nHe also noted that the last time such homage held was on June 4, 2019 when residents came during the Eid al-Fitr.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you also for graciously agreeing to allow us to come in with a high number of people representing a very large spectrum of the FCT community.\n\n\u201cVisitors here include religious leaders of various denominations, the Muslim and the Christian faith, community leaders, the Judiciary, members of the National Assembly representing the FCT as well as other stakeholders,\u2019\u2019 Bello said.

We know how he traded off the struggle in the past and was rewarded for betraying the same course he was pursuing,\u201d the statement read.\n\nOhanaeze youths, however, cautioned Uwazurike and his likes to retrace their steps from a \u201cdestructive journey as the day of reckoning will surely come\u201d, while maintaining that a million Uwazurike cannot stop the 2023 Igbo Presidency project.\n\nMeanwhile, MASSOB, led by Uchenna Madu, has exonerated the group from what it described as the show of shame and reckless insensitivity of Uwazuruike and his hired Igbo youths that paraded themselves as MASSOB members in Owerri conducting a political rally for the support of Bello\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nThe pro-Biafra group in a statement signed by its National Director of Information, Edeson Samuel, said their members were not in the rally.\n\nThe group stated: \u201cMASSOB has never engaged or campaigned or rallied for any politician vying for political office in Nigeria. Our primary duty of existence is for Biafra\u2019s actualisation and restoration through non-violence. We can never be agitating for Biafran autonomy and at the same time romancing with the major enemies of the people of Biafra.\u201c\n\n\u201cMASSOB warned Ralph Uwazuruike, the leader of Biafra Independent Movement to stop parading himself as MASSOB leader, and also to stop using MASSOB for merchandise.\u201d\n\nEdeson explained that Uwazuruike was expelled from MASSOB in November 2015 because of corruption and betrayal of trust/ confidence.\n\n\u201cRalph Uwazuruike campaigning for the governor of Kogi state against his Igbo brother is nothing but to fulfil the agreement he signed with the Hausa Fulani cabals in 2013 and also to pay for the money he received from the governor of Kogi State, Alhaji Yahaya Bello,\u201d the statement partly read.",

John Joseph Hayab, CAN Kaduna state chairman, in a statement explained, \u201cThe attention of the CAN Kaduna State Chapter has been drawn to the news in circulation in some sections of the media about one Pastor described as Ade Abraham, offering to take his members to heaven if they pay a fee of 310 thousand nairas only.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cEven though Pastor Ade\u2019s offer of a ticket to heaven is cheaper than the ransom Kaduna bandits ask their victims, sadly, CAN has not found anyone who knows the location of the said church or established a church in Kaduna town with that name or in any local government areas in the state.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rev. Hayab, a faceless character like Ade Abraham can easily give the faith of the community a bad name, especially that CAN cannot trace his whereabouts or find any useful information about his being in Kaduna State.\n\nHe observed that is it possible that Ade Abraham before becoming spiritual had lived in Kaduna or did he come to Kaduna for a visit? asking, \u201cHow can we have such a pastor and nobody knows him only for us to read about his drama in the media whereas the journalists in Kaduna do not have this information?\u201d\n\nHe said CAN Kaduna State appealed to whosoever knows Pastor Ade Abraham or the location of a Church in Kaduna linked to the alleged person to furnish their association with the information so that they could work with security agencies to prevent what could further compound the security challenges faced in the state.\n\n\u201cCAN will not decide what sermon her priests should preach but CAN will not hesitate to expose fake preachers when she finds one, especially when the sermon contradicts the teachings contained in the Holy Scriptures,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nIt, therefore, called for a proper investigation of Pastor Ade Abraham\u2019s identity, and the location of his ministry to put the record straight to avoid creating panic and misleading the public.\n\nThe statement stated that if Abraham\u2019s camp is in Ekiti and the sacred place where God is coming to rapture those who have paid their rapture fees, the statement wondered why Kaduna is in the story.\n\nCAN advise the Christian faith not to rush into accepting every kind of teaching without first studying the Scriptures to understand if what the preacher says is true like the Berean believers who studied the Scriptures, day and night, to confirm what the Apostle Paul was saying was true.",

          "title": "Row over ECOWAS Common External Tariff",
          "text": "Early this month, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) dumped the old version of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET 2017- 2021) to the new one (2022- 2026). In this report, OLUWAKEMI DAUDA looks at the implications of the new version to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nFew weeks ago, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) migrated from the old version of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (2017- 2021) to the new one (2022- 2026).\n\nNCS Public Relations Officer, Timi Bomodi, said the migration was in line with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) five-year review of the nomenclature, where the contracting parties are expected to adopt the new version on regional considerations and national economic policy.\n\nWhile Bomodi said the implementation of the new version of the CET takes immediate effect, stakeholders, who spoke with The Nation, warned against this, saying it would be counter productive to the economy.\n\nThe stakeholders said the implementation of the latest version of CET amounted to official highhandedness and lack of consideration for the organised private sector by those in the position of authority.\n\nThey challenged Customs to point out the economic impact of the two per cent NAC levy that had been collected for over two decades by the Service on Nigerians.\n\nCET\n\nThe ECOWAS Tariff and statistics nomenclature is a common customs nomenclature based on the harmonised system of description and coding of goods (HS) adopted by the community. It is a 10-digit tariff and statistical nomenclature defining the list of goods making up the tariff and statistics nomenclature categories of the CET.\n\nIt is the application of the same customs duties, import quotas and preferences by a group of countries in a customs union. The import duties, quotas and preferences are applicable to good entering the region of the customs union irrespective of the country of first entry of the goods.\n\nThe CET is one of the principal instruments for harmonising ECOWAS Member States and strengthening its common market.To establish an economic union, the community is to ensure, in stages, among other means, the establishment of a common market through \u201cthe adoption of a common external tariff and a common trade policy vis-\u00e0-vis third countries \u2026\u201d To this end, the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government established an ECOWAS Customs necessitating the formulation of a common external tariff with a common nomenclature so that customs procedures are transparent, readily followed and delays at borders decreased, is a key stone in achieving this union.\n\nIn January 2006 in Niamey, The Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS adopted a decision establishing the ECOWAS-CET, which draws on the basic UEMOA CET composed of four tariff bands, or rates of customs duty.\n\nWhat the NCS said\n\nExplaining the CET, Bomodi, NCS spokesman, had said: \u201dThe nation has adopted tariff lines with few adjustments in the CET. As allowed for in Annex II of the 2022-2026 CET, and in line with the Finance Act and the National Automotive Policy, NCS has retained a duty rate of 20 per cent for used vehicles as was transmitted by ECOWAS with a NAC levy of 15 per cent. New vehicles will also pay a duty of 20 per cent with a NAC levy of 20 per cent as directed in the Federal Ministry of Finance letter ref. no. HMF BNP/NCS/CET/4/2022 of April 7, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that domestic fiscal policy on the importation of motor vehicles and other items is targeted at growing the economy in these sectors.The focus of the NCS is on the implementation of these policies in the hope that it achieves its desired objectives in line with the National Automotive Policy and other fiscal policies of the government.\n\n\u201cThe NCS has also activated the use of Chapters 98 and 99 of the CET, in accordance with WCO recommendation for national use by contracting parties, which in our case promotes industrialisation through sectoral and sub-sectoral incentives for members targeted at economic growth, enhancement of security and minimised consumption of unwholesome goods.\n\n\u201cIt should also be noted that the automotive industry, bona fide assemblers, manufacturers of auto spare parts, and other local manufacturers enhance technology transfer and skill acquisition, create jobs, and increase per capita income.\n\n\u201cIn Chapter 98 of the CET \u2013 bona fide assemblers importing Completely Knocked Down (CKD) and Semi-Knocked Down (SKD) are to enjoy a concession of zero per cent and 10 per cent Duty rate. While within ECOWAS, duty rates for the same items are five per cent and 10 per cent.\n\n\u201cIncentivising their efforts through policy interventions guarantees a win-win situation for the nation in the long run.\u201d\n\nStakeholders react\n\nBut stakeholders in the industry have lamented this new version of CET, tagging it as one of the unfavourable policies of the Federal Government despite the explanation by the NCS that it is in line with the Finance Act and the National Automotive Policy. The service had retained a duty rate of 20 per cent for used vehicles as was transmitted by ECOWAS with a NAC levy of 15 per cent.\n\nWorried by the new policy, the stakeholders berated the government. One of them, a former President of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), Prince Olayiwola Shittu, said the introduction of regular wrong policies would continue to have negative effect on the maritime trade and bad impact on the growth of the economy.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, when the Federal Government continues to take a wrong turn, the economy suffers. Policy somersaults result in negative economic developments. At a time like this, we expect our leaders to step in diligently and make the interest of Nigerians paramount in their minds.\n\n\u201cWe are worried because when the government said that new vehicles would also pay a duty of 20 per cent with a NAC levy of 20 per cent as directed in Federal Ministry of Finance letter ref. no. HMF BNP/NCS/ CET/4/2022 of 7th April 2022.\u201d\n\nAlso, the National President, Africa Association of Professional Freight Forwarders and Logistics of Nigeria (APFFLON) Otunba Frank Ogunojemite, argued that by the new levy, Customs had shown a high level of inconsistency capable of betraying trust and undermining the cordial working relationships with freight forwarders and importers.\n\nOgunojemite said the association was against the collection of NAC levy on used vehicles, adding that it should be limited to brand new vehicles only.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe demand to know why used vehicles should pay NAC levy, and how the money will be appropriated. When Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was Finance minister, she removed NAC levy, which was two per cent then. Why the sudden imposition of 15 per cent and 20 per cent NAC levy on Nigerians?\n\n\u201cNigerian importers lost over N300 billion in demurrage in the last protest caused by increased target given to NCS by the Federal Government. It is high time Customs commenced interface with critical stakeholders on revenue policies to forestall crises in Nigerian ports.\u201d\n\nFormer President, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Dr. Eugene Nweke, also faulted Customs the NAC levy of 15 per cent in addition to the duty rate for imported vehicles, saying that implementation of the latest version of CET amounted to multiple charges.\n\nNweke said Customs should point out the impact of the levy that had been collected for over two decades on the economy.\n\nThe maritime expert said the levy was a pointer to the administrative incoherence and confusions on the part of Federal Government.\n\nHe said: \u201cCustoms action depicts the fact that we have endorsed the CET, but have also done our adjustment to accommodate the NAC levy of 15 per cent additional to the duty rate for an imported vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe 2013 Automobile Policy leading to the issuance of permit to over 130 automobile plants, with its accompany 35 per cent Import Duty and 35 per cent levy on new vehicles and 35 per cent duty with7.5 per cent Vat on used vehicles \u2013 is aimed defeated or actualised, because most of the licensed automobile plants has turned to mere traders, in the face of increasing import volume for used and accident vehicle, mostly so, where the intent of the policy was to evolve a mass production of quality and affordable vehicles for the Nigeria populace?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a motor dealer, Folagbade Adebanjo, predicted that the CET would crash in the nearest future because, according to him, the treaty will not aid trade facilitation in the ports.\n\nJustification by the govt\n\nThe government said the rationale behind the new duty and the collection of the National Automotive Council (NAC) levy was because of the review of the ECOWAS CET for 2022 to 2026, saying that this necessitated a downward adjustment of import duty on vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Customs Service migrated from the old version of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (2017- 2021) to the new version (2022- 2026). This is in-line with WCO five-year review of the nomenclature,\u201d Bomodi said\n\nAccording to him, the new decisions were in tandem with CET, the Finance Act and the National Automotive Council policy of the government.\n\nImportance of the policy\n\nAccording to Customs, part of the objectives of the government is to use the new version of CET to grow the economy.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that domestic fiscal policy on the importation of motor vehicles and other items is targeted at growing the local economy in these sectors. The focus of NCS is on implementation of these policies in the hope that it achieves its desired objectives in line with National Automotive Policy and other fiscal policies of government.\u201d\n\nAlso, Bomodi explained that NCS had activated the use of Chapters 98 and 99 of the CET, in accordance with WCO\u2019s recommendation for national use by contracting parties, which in our case promotes industrialisation through sectoral and subsectoral incentives for members targeted at economic growth, enhancement of security and minimised consumption of unwholesome goods\n\nHe stressed that in Chapter 98 of the new CET, bona fide assemblers importing Completely Knocked Down (CKD) and Semi Knocked Down (SKD) would enjoy a concession of zero per cent and 10 per cent duty rate, while within ECOWAS, duty rate for same items would be five per cent and 10 per cent.\n\nHow to make it work\n\nTo make the new levy acceptable, a motor dealer said the Federal Government, through the Customs, needs to embark on serious sensitisation of the importers, clearing agents and other critical stakeholders before the commencement of the implementation of the new version of CET. A motor dealer added that the Federal Government\u2019s approval on the implementation of the new policy would cause more harm than good for importers, pointing out there was the need for dialogue.",

          "title": "\u2018Dangote Refinery will focus on gas export, others\u2019",
          "text": "Recently, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, was ona facility tour of Dangote Refinery in Lekki, Lagos. On the sidelines of the visit, the refinery\u2019s Group Executive Director, Strategy, Portfolio Development and Capital Projects, Devakumar Edwin, spoke with MUYIWA LUCAS about how the refinery will be a show stopper and a huge foreign exchange earner for the country.\n\nNigerians are looking up to when Dangote Refinery will become operational as they are optimistic that it will be a huge relief in a multi-dimensional way. Can you tell us when it would be ready?\n\nThe refinery will be ready for inauguration before the end of the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. By the grace of God, Mr. President will come and inaugurate it before the end of his tenure. Efforts to complete the refinery are in top gear, particularly as it would create jobs and generate more taxes, which would be used by the government to develop the country further. Again, in the near future, through the refinery, more employment opportunities would be created while we keep doing new things and paying our taxes, which will complement the government\u2019s effort in providing education, and good health,among others.\n\nDo you export fertiliser from your jetty to other countries?\n\nBy the grace of God, we have completed the fertiliser plant and have gone into production. We have commenced export to the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. Now, this ship (pointing to a vessel on the ocean) is going to Argentina. We also send it to India. In addition, each ship can handle about 32,000 tonnes.\n\nWhat does the economy stand to gain from this massive investment?\n\nDangote Refinery is a huge opportunity for the country to gain foreign exchange (forex). The whole idea is to focus on natural gas. We are trying to export gas and add value to the country, generate employment and create huge opportunities.\n\nWhat can you say about the capacity of the refinery, particularly on its rating from global economy perspective?\n\nWhat I can say is that the refinery is the world\u2019s largest single train petroleum refinery and was designed to maximise production of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) with a capacity of about 53 per cent compared to 20 per cent by other refineries.The petroleum refinery can meet 100 per cent of the requirements of Nigeria, of the liquid products \u2013 gasoline (PMS), Diesel (AGO), Kerosene (DPK) and Aviation Jet Fuel (Jet A-1). While 60 per cent of the production of this petroleum refinery can meet the entire requirement of Nigeria, the rest 40 per cent will go for export, generating huge amount of foreign exchange. In fact, the refinery is of a strategic national importance as it will solve the perennial challenge of fuel scarcity, and boost massive employment for Nigerians.\n\nAre you not worried about potash scarcity as a result of the Russian/Ukrainian conflict?\n\nNot at all, there is no need for worry as only 26 per cent of the world\u2019s potash supply comes from the two countries.There are other countries that have it, it is not only Ukraine that has it. Yes, Ukraine and Russia have about 26 per cent of the world\u2019s potash. That means it can be sourced from elsewhere. So, I am not really very concerned, the concern is just about price.\n\nFrom the perspective of facts and figures, what is the state of preparedness of the refinery?\n\nLet me say 75 per cent hydraulic testing of the refinery as well as 70 per cent of electrical cable fitting have been completed preparatory to the completion in the fourth quarter of this year as I earlier assured.The refinery, which boasts of 4.742 billion litres storage capacity, will serve as a strategic reserve for the country. Again, 75 per cent of the products of the refinery (petrol, kerosene, aviation fuel and diesel) will be dispatched through the sea, by which products could be transported to Calabar, Warri, Lagos and Port Harcourt. The refinery is being built at a cost of $19 billion while the fertiliser plant costs $2.5 billion.\n\nRecently, Dangote Industries Limited sponsored the International Trade fairs in Abeokuta and Enugu. Why?\n\nFirst and foremost, let me say the need to help in revving up commerce, industry and economic activities in the country was the motivation behind the sponsorships. As you are aware, the trade fair in Abeokuta was organised by the Ogun Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture while Enugu Trade Fair was powered by Enugu Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture. Besides these fairs, Dangote Group also was the major sponsor of the recently concluded Kaduna Trade Fair.\n\nWas it because five of Dangote Group\u2019s subsidiaries participated in both fairs that such magnanimous support was rendered?\n\nNot at all! The support was altruistic. It is in our nature to always support any activity we considered to be of benefit to the nation\u2019s economy. As you are aware, Dangote Industries is a good corporate citizen.The evidence is there. The subsidiaries that participated in the both fairs cut across Dangote Cement, Dangote Sugar, NASCON, Dangote Oil Refinery and Dangote Fertiliser.Their participations were necessitated by the fact that trade fairs have become veritable avenues for our subsidiaries to bond with their customers. In fact, the fairs afforded our officials from Dangote Fertiliser that was recently inaugurated to operate a special helpdesk for customers and farmers who want information on distribution and application of fertiliser. The desk was manned by well-trained officers who were groomed to answer questions and inquiries on the use of fertiliser. NASCON gave its customers a good treat at the fair even as it added to the richness of products like Danq seasoning and stew/soup mixes and also embarked on an expansion of its distribution network to make the product more readily accessible to consumers. Dangote Sugar Refinery took its product ranges to the fair, while its Sales/Marketing team was fully on ground to attend to customers and prospective new distributors. Customers were encouraged to visit the stand and buy products at Trade Fair prices. Dangote Cement, which is a regular participant at the fairs, operated an office at the Dangote Group Pavilion where customers and users of its cement products were encouraged to visit the office during the event for consultations with the team which was on ground. The fair offered opportunities to customers and other visitors to the fairs who intend becoming distributors of any of the products from Dangote Group subsidiaries to be well informed by staff of the companies who were on hand to put the customers through on how to go about it.\n\nThe Board of Directors and President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, recently went to Abuja to see President Muhammadu Buhari. Was the visit about intimating him ahead of the inauguration of the refinery within the year?\n\nNo, we went to pay him a courtesy call and also to thank him for coming to inaugurate our fertiliser plant on March 22, 2022, that is about four weeks ago. So, we went to see him to show gratitude to Mr. President and we were well received.",

A threat to the media is a threat to our democracy. Governments at all levels must take the lead in making sure that their actions do not inspire violations of press freedom. A democratic society like Nigeria should know that it has a crucial role to play in maintaining media freedom and facilitating access to public information.

          "text": "\u2022Declare another eight years of northern presidency unacceptable\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has issued a stern warning to those trying to do away with the zoning of the presidency in the country, saying any attempt to end zoning, as being insinuated in some northern quarters, would spell the end for Nigeria.\n\nThe leaders condemned a statement credited to the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Alhaji Ango Abdullahi, that rotation of the presidency between the north and south was \u201cdead and buried\u201d. They declared that another eight years of northern presidency, after President Muhammadu Buhari, was unacceptable.\n\nThe position of the leaders was contained in a joint statement yesterday by National Leader, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and Chairman, SMBLF, Chief Edwin Clark; leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor; and National President, Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus. They said they were prepared for those attempting to upturn a practice \u2013 zoning \u2013 that had sustained the country.\n\nThe group warned that any attempt to kill and bury the age-long power rotation agreement between the north and south was tantamount to an attempt to kill and bury Nigeria.\n\nSMBLF warned that the move to tinker with the rotation of the presidency was inimical to national unity.\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt leaders also warned Abdullahi\u2019s NEF, and wondered if the northern body was now out to dissolve the country.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cSMBLF says it is rather unfortunate and absurd that Ango Abdullahi and his Northern Elders Forum would make such twaddle. Are they now ready to dissolve the country? What has happened that zoning, which has been a sine qua non in the nation\u2019s political progression, has now become a \u2018dead and buried\u2019 issue, in the irrational contemplations of Ango Abdullahi and his co-travellers?\n\n\u201cCould it be due to the incapacity, insipidity and disastrous performance of the Buhari administration or the narcissistic desire to perpetuate Hausa/Fulani hegemony? It has become necessary to underscore that Ango Abdullahi, with his established disposition of inconsistency and duplicity, is one of the people disturbing the polity and peace of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, this same Ango fumbled with the idea of a so-called consensus arrangement for northern presidential aspirants, he has not come out of it. Now he has sprung up with this reckless statement that zoning is dead and buried. Ango and his northern elders do not have the power to kill and bury zoning. If they want to kill and bury Nigeria, then we are ready for them.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesmen stated that the \u201chistory of zoning between the north and the south is well-known to everybody in this country and has been respected by all the major political parties in Nigeria.\u201d They recalled that all the ruling political parties from the Second Republic, such as the now defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and the current opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had adhered to the principle of zoning.\n\nThe elders also accused the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Adamu Abdullahi, of outright dishonesty and chicanery for saying APC had not decided the zoning of the presidency.\n\nAccording to SMBLF, \u201cMore so, earlier this year, the nation and global audience were told by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on a national/satellite television station, Channels Television, that zoning of the party and political elective offices exists in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe governor further hinted that all the positions earlier held by the north would be swapped with the south and vice versa. And this was inclusive of the presidency. That was the reason why only northerners vied for the national chairmanship of the party, which was zoned to the north and micro-zoned to the North-central, during the party\u2019s national convention in March this year.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are now being told by the newly \u2018imposed\u2019 national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, that the APC has not decided on the zoning of the presidency. Such a statement at this stage, with about 30 days to the presidential primaries, amounts to outright dishonesty and chicanery. Who are they trying to deceive and who will allow them?\n\n\u201cIt becomes even more upsetting given the fact that the statement came from someone who himself emerged as National Chairman of the APC through the policy of rotation and zoning.\u201d\n\nThe southern leaders added, \u201cIt is haughty for anybody to say that this is the time to consider the quality of candidates. Where in Nigeria is deficient in quality candidates? Is it the south or the north? Everyone of the individuals from the south, who has indicated interest to contest for the presidency, both in APC and in PDP, is qualified to be President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey should stop their trickery. Enough is enough! We cannot have a northerner president for eight years and then welcome another northern president for another eight years or more. That is unacceptable to us. We, therefore, strongly caution all our governors, former governors, and top politicians not to accept the vice presidency nomination from any northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe urge the 17 southern governors, who unanimously declared that the presidency must come to the south in May last year, at Asaba, Delta State, to remain resolute. They have our absolute support for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum and we stand firmly by them. This country belongs to all of us!\n\n\u201cLet everybody take this as a serious warning that the issue of zoning cannot be swept under the carpet; it cannot be dead and buried, if zoning is buried, Nigeria is, then, buried. And if they are thinking that this is a joke, let it be known that it is not. If we cannot abide by the established principle of rotation and zoning between the north and the south, then we should not continue with one Nigeria; we should go back to what we were as a people before the amalgamation of 1914.\n\n\u201cWe also earnestly call on the people of the Middle Belt Region and all minorities in Nigeria to wake up and work conscientiously with the southerners, if we do, the prospects will be pellucid. This was demonstrated at the National Conference of 2014 to the mortification of those who think this country belongs to them alone.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Assures families victims will safely return\n\n\u2022Says terrorists using captives as human shields, making their rescue difficult\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said rescuing the kidnapped passengers of the Kaduna-bound train that was recently attacked by terrorists was a delicate situation, which required wisdom, utmost caution, and proper handling. Buhari, however, assured the families of the victims that efforts were on-going to ensure the safe return of all those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nThe president claimed that the rescue had been made difficult because the terrorists were holding the captives close to places that could be targeted by security operatives in the event of a strong rescue operation, to deter such attack. He directed security agencies and the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to provide more regular and detailed information to the victims\u2019 families on their condition and efforts to save them.\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in his own remarks, restated the country\u2019s trust in God, praying that the Almighty would fulfil the heart desires of all Muslims and every Nigerian.\n\nTerrorists had on March 28 attacked a Kaduna-bound train, killing no fewer than nine people, injuring several others, and abducting most of the passengers.\n\nThe president\u2019s assurances on efforts to secure the victims\u2019 release came on the heels of a recent lawsuit filed against him by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) over failure to protect the rights to life, security, and dignity of the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. SERAP also sued the president for his failure to secure the safe release of those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nBut speaking yesterday while receiving some residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Sallah homage at the State House, Abuja, Buhari said the government would explore every opportunity to rescue the captives alive and unhurt. He lamented that terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, did not respect the rules of engagement and could resort to harming hostages, when attacked.\n\nBuhari urged Nigerians to create a hostile environment for criminals hiding in communities, saying by sheltering criminals, they are endangering their own security and the security of their own communities. He said strong synergy between security agencies and communities would make a huge difference in efforts to defeat banditry and terrorism in the country.\n\nThe president allayed fears that bandits could grow to yet another big challenge, like the Boko Haram threat, assuring Nigerians that the administration would not allow such to happen, as the welfare of the people of Abuja and all Nigerians remained paramount.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAs we celebrate this occasion with joy amidst friends and family members, we are fully conscious of the fact that many families in our country are in a state of fear and anxiety on account of the many captives held by terrorists against their will, including those taken away after the tragic bombing of the Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\n\u201cI have directed security agencies to ensure quick and safe recovery of all victims of kidnapping. I urge the railway management to immediately set up a situation room for the coordination of the rescue mission and for a minute-by-minute engagement with the families of the captives.\n\n\u201cThis should ease their pain and anxiety as we push the military to finding a safe return to their families. My aim is to see all those in captivity safely rescued. Let me assure Nigerians that the bandits are just pushing their luck, but this is only for a while before they are finally crushed.\n\n\u201cThey are using civilians as human shields, thereby making it difficult to confront them directly. Terrorists don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack. It\u2019s a delicate situation that requires wisdom, caution and also patience. Any rescue operation that results in the death of any hostage cannot be deemed a success.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want this kind of tragic outcome. It\u2019s a complex situation that demands proper handling. The primary objective of any rescue operation is to free the hostages safely, unharmed and alive. Let me make it clear, however, that defeating the terrorists and bandits requires more than weapons.\n\n\u201cWe also need human intelligence, which is necessary to frustrate terrorist plans. The people and community leaders should help our security officials with information about the activities or movements of criminal groups.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the president said his administration had allocated huge resources to improve the capacity of the security forces through timely and adequate supply of equipment and improving the welfare of personnel to boost their morale.\n\nHe said Abuja had witnessed remarkable improvement in terms of security, and claimed that in the past, terrorists had made it almost impossible to lead normal lives in the capital city.\n\nThe president said the completion of the Abuja light rail was one of the major projects embarked on by the administration for the inhabitants, as development of infrastructure remained essential to economic growth. He added that the government would continue to give serious attention to the town and link roads to other states as well as electricity and power.\n\nOsinbajo, at the occasion, thanked God for giving Buhari \u201call that you have required to tackle these challenges and for giving you the life and strength to tackle the challenges and to surmount the challenges.\u201d\n\nThe vice president noted that despite the challenges, Nigeria remained united. He stated, \u201cEvery generation of leaders is confronted with its own problems. There is no leader that is not confronted with his own or her own problems.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo expressed gratitude to the president, on behalf of the invited guests, for hosting the gathering.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Analysts attribute decline to high volume of currency in circulation\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\n\n\nDeposit money banks (DMBs and merchant banks borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Standing Lending Facility (SLF) dropped year-on-year (YoY) by 66 per cent to N1.49 trillion in first four months of 2022, from N4.44 trillion in the comparable period of 2021.\n\nFinancial institutions in Nigeria through the SLF borrow funds from the apex bank to meet their financial intermediation role.\n\nThe apex bank lends money to banks and merchant banks through the SLF at an interest rate of 100 basis points (bpts) above the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) of 11.50 per cent.\n\nThe trend between January and April 2022, as gathered from the CBN website revealed steady decline in bank and merchant banks\u2019 borrowings, driven by improvement in the level of liquidity in the interbank system.\n\nHowever, analysts have said the development was due to low rates on savings instruments, matured T-bills and bonds have not rolled over, resulting to more currency in circulation.\n\nAn analysis of the CBN financial data revealed that banks and other financial institutions in January 2022, borrowed N313.48 billion, which was a decline of 25.5 per cent from N426.7 billion borrowed in January 2021.\n\nIn February, the total amount borrowed by banks and merchant banks dropped further by 70 per cent to N186.48 billion from N621.7 billion in February 2021.\n\nThe trend continued in March 2022, as the CBN data revealed that N377 billion was borrowed by banks and merchant banks compared to N904.68 billion in March 2021. Also, the amount borrowed by banks and merchants\u2019 banks in April 2022 stood at N612.43 billion, a 75.4 per cent decline from N2.48 trillion reported by the CBN in April 2021.\n\nFinance experts attributed the development to improved business environment post Covid-19, stressing that this paved the way for banks and merchant banks to halt borrowing from the CBN this year.\n\nIn a chat with THISDAY, the Head, Financial Institutions\u2019 Ratings Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi said: \u201cThere are presently low rates, and remember that before 2019, T-bills were actually high and a lot of those instruments are maturing now, so there is money in circulation. And this has been the trend over the last couple of months.\u201d\n\nHe, however predicted that the CBN might soon put out measures to curb excess liquidity in circulation.\n\n\u201cOnce CBN feels the amount of liquidity in circulation is too much, they have different instruments they can use to mop it up. Also remember that as electioneering starts there would be more money in circulation and CBN can get more aggressive,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori said uncertainty in the nation\u2019s economy forced banks and merchant banks to shun borrowing from CBN.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cBanks and merchant banks have excess liquidity and might not need to borrow from CBN. Besides, economic uncertainty has started to surface following the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, analysts at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye maintained that banks and merchant banks in first four months of 2021, borrowed enough funds from the CBN to meet their daily obligations.\n\nHe stressed that the nation\u2019s economy in 2021, had normalised, giving room for banks and merchant banks to reduce borrowing from the CBN in 2022.\n\nAdeyeye explained that banks and merchant banks are maintaining effective risk management in a move to cut down down non-performing Loan (NPL) in the financial sector.\n\nHe added that: \u201cBanks and merchant banks with increasing deposit from customers prefer to lend to CBN rather than their customers to maintain NPL below five per cent threshold demanded by CBN.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Party appeals ruling to show cause why primary should not be suspended*Second aggrieved group says party can only rotate candidacy, not presidency\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nTwo Groups have moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s silence on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nOne of the groups is led by one of its presidential aspirants and a former Deputy Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Mr. Cosmas Ndukwe, moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s stand on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nThe kernel of their cases are that the PDP over the years had a tradition of power rotation and zoning.\n\nThe group argued that the only office the opposition party has to offer was the presidential candidate, which they argued should rotate between the north and the south\n\n\n\nThey cited the fact that since the return of democracy in 1999, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, from southern Nigeria was the first to govern the country, followed by the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua from the northern part of the country. This was followed by Goodluck Jonathan from the southern part of the country and now Muhammadu Buhari from the north.\n\n\n\nJustice Donatus Okorowo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had last Thursday, ordered the PDP to appear before it on May 5, to show cause why the request of one of its presidential aspirants to stop the scheduled primary election for the selection of the party\u2019s flag bearer in the 2023 presidential election should not be granted.\n\n\n\nThe PDP had fixed May 28, for the conduct of its presidential primary election and to that effect screened the 17 aspirants who obtained the presidential form to run in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nIn the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/508/2022 are the PDP, National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Atu, Senator Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) as 1st to fourth respondents respectively.\n\nRather than grant the request, the judge ordered that the PDP should appear before it and show cause why the court should not accede to the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\n\n\n\nIn the suit filed by his lawyer, Mr Paul Erokoro, Ndukwe also challenged the scheduled presidential primary on the grounds that it breached its own constitution on zoning.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP has a rotation of elective offices in place, and by that arrangement, it ought to be the turn of the south to produce the president.\n\n\n\nAs of last week, it was obvious that the PDP was not considering zoning its Presidential ticket to the south as being clamoured by southern governors and other leaders in the zone.\n\n\n\nAlso, a member of the other group challenging the party over the issue of zoning, who pleaded to remain anonymous, pointed out that, \u201cthe presidency is not for the PDP to give; the only thing the PDP can give is its presidential ticket and that must be rotated.\n\n\n\nBut the PDP has challenged the jurisdiction of a Federal High Court to summon it over the issue which the party described as its internal affairs.\n\n\n\nThis emerged just as former Minister of Police Affairs and member of the zoning committee of the party, Adamu Maina Waziri has called on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket of the party.\n\n\n\nThe PDP in a Notice of Preliminary Objection filed on Friday, by its lawyer, Mr Mahmud Magaji, submitted that the subject matter of the case which borders on whether to zone its presidential ticket to any part of the country was not an issue that the court has the mandate to decide.\n\n\n\nThe PDP asked the court to strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction and also dismiss it for being \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.\n\nAccording to the defendants, \u201cthe cause of action in the suit relates to the internal affairs of a political party and therefore falls within the doctrine of political questions which are non-justiciable\u201d and as such the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of statute-barred, the PDP noted that the cause of action arose from the PDP National Zoning Committee Communique of April 5 whereas the plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed on April 19 (15 days after) in violation of Section 285 of the Constitution which provides for 14 days to file such cases.\n\n\n\nWhile arguing further that the plaintiff lacked the necessary legal right to initiate the case, the PDP submitted that no civil right of the plaintiff has been wrong pursuant to section 6(6) of the Constitution.\n\nThe party, therefore, urged the court to uphold its objection and dismiss the case of the plaintiff, adding that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced or suffer any hardship if the case was dismissed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the 3rd defendant in the suit Senator Anyanwu had approached the Court of Appeal to set aside the order of Justice Okorowo on the defendants to show cause, arguing that the trial judge erred in law when it arrived at that decision without according to them a fair hearing.\n\n\n\nAmong other complaints against the judgment of the lower court was that while the originating summons of Ndukwe was not ripe for hearing, the time for appellants to respond to the suit has also not lapsed, adding that respondents have taken steps to file counter affidavit against the suit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe learned trial judge erred in entertaining an ex parte motion which seeks to stop the presidential primary election of the appellant without hearing notice\u201d, adding that the court further erred in law when it failed to \u201caver its mind to section 84(15) of the Electoral Act, 2022, before making an order to show cause\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe appellant in the Notice of Appeal dated April 29, further urged the court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of Justice Okorowo asking the PDP to show cause why its scheduled primary election should not be halted.\n\nPDP Presidential Ticket: Let Delegates Decide, Ex-minister Tells Party Leaders\n\nMeanwhile, Waziri who called on the NEC of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket the of the party, also alleged that the issue of zoning in the party was being fuelled by external influences who are not members of the party.\n\n\n\nThe ex-minister claimed that at no time did the PDP mandate General Ibrahim Babangida and Prof. Ango Abdullahi to help it find a consensus candidate for the party\n\nHe said the PDP was not obliged to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election, saying the party was preoccupied to use any legitimate method to win the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are a party in opposition, our concern at the moment is to use any legitimate process to get back to power. It is the ruling party that should be concerned with zoning, but not the PDP. Ours as an opposition party is to win through Democratic measure.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur concern is to allow the delegates to the presidential convention to the analysis and know who out of the cleared presidential aspirants has the competence and strength of character to win the presidential election for the party \u201c\n\nThe former Minister of Police Affairs stressed that Babangida and Abdullahi have no mandate of the party to conduct any consensus for the presidential candidate to emerge.\n\n\n\nAccording to the former minister who is also a member of the 37-man think tank on zoning, who spoke on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, \u201d it is not true that zoning is tearing the PDP apart. It is all about media creation and external influences that are creating the media controversy within the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you not hear what two frontline presidential aspirants, Peter Obi and Emmanuel Udom said the position of the PDP on zoning is supreme as the party decision on this is final. We will enthrone the best method that would be in the interest of the party and democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some policemen working at the Nigerian Police Academy, Wudil, Kano State, have asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to call the commandant of the institution, Abdurrahman Ahmad, to order.\n\nThe officers, while speaking with SaharaReporters, accused Ahmad, an Assistant Inspector-General of Police of marginalisation and a subtle islamisation agenda.\n\nAccording to them, postings of police officers in the Academy to offices are biased and sectional in nature.\n\n\u201cFor any organisation or public office to attain its aims and objectives, its leaders and those at the helm of affairs ought to be unbiased, without sentiments, and victimisation of subjects based on religious faith,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cThe above-mentioned features are completely absent in the present management of the Academy under the leadership of AIG Abdurrahman Ahmad as the Commandant whose agenda of Islamisation of the institution is glaring.\n\n\u201cPostings of police officers in the Academy to offices are biased and sectional in nature. In a place where senior police officers like Chief Superintendents of Police are without posting, an unconfirmed and incompetent Assistant Superintendent of Police is in charge of the investigation because he is a Muslim.\n\n\u201cThe post of PPRO is manned and left in the hands of an Inspector of police because he is a Muslim and so many other postings within the Academy. On Thursday 28the April 2022, he summoned the Chaplain and the Rev. Father and accused them of spreading the news that he is islamising the academy.\u201d\n\nAnother officer said the academy despite being a federal institution has been left in the hands of principal officers in acting capacity without official letters for more than three years.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is also sad to note that the Academy as a federal institution is left in the hands of people (principal officers) in acting capacity without official letters for more than 3 years just to be using them to siphon public funds.\n\n\u201cWorrisome to note is that the principal officers without confirmation of their appointments have been collecting and enjoying the emolument/salaries of the substantive ranks or offices they are occupying which is against financial regulations.\n\n\u201cThe appointments of Deans, Head of Departments, and other sections in the academy are issued to the loyalists of the acting coordinator who will not challenge their corrupt proclivities. Since its inception, the Academic Staff of the Academy has never benefitted from Earned Allowances as it is applicable in other public universities because of the incompetency of the management of the Academy.\n\n\u201cThis is conspicuous in the 4 weeks down tools embarked on by the Academy Staff after issuing a communique. Instead, the commandant issued sack threats. At the cadet's dining, cadets are separated because of the fasting of the Muslims with special meals and treatments for the Muslims and regular for that of Christian cadets.\n\n\u201cIt's not hyperbole to state that most Christian cadets no longer go to the dining because of fear that they might be poisoned having seen his Islamisation agenda, pending when the dining and meals will be merged.\n\n\u201cThe separation of the dining wouldn't have been a bad ideal but the perceived negative effects it might have on the Christian faithful are worrisome. Christians celebrated Easter without special meals or presents from the school but for the celebration of Eid-Fitri, two big cows for the Muslims which clearly showed that he is biased thus rendering him unfit to hold a public office.\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of the optional head scarfs for Muslim female serving police officers, the female cadets on training in the Academy now use scarfs. In the North where insurgency, kidnapping, and banditry attacks are prone to occur at any time, it could be a plan for the attackers to identify the Muslims and spare them.\u201d\n\nCalls put across by SaharaReporters to the Nigerian police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, were not picked nor returned.",

          "text": "Some policemen working at the Nigerian Police Academy, Wudil, Kano State, have asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to call the commandant of the institution, Abdurrahman Ahmad, to order.\n\nThe officers, while speaking with SaharaReporters, accused Ahmad, an Assistant Inspector-General of Police of marginalisation and a subtle islamisation agenda.\n\nAccording to them, postings of police officers in the Academy to offices are biased and sectional in nature.\n\n\u201cFor any organisation or public office to attain its aims and objectives, its leaders and those at the helm of affairs ought to be unbiased, without sentiments, and victimisation of subjects based on religious faith,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cThe above-mentioned features are completely absent in the present management of the Academy under the leadership of AIG Abdurrahman Ahmad as the Commandant whose agenda of Islamisation of the institution is glaring.\n\n\u201cPostings of police officers in the Academy to offices are biased and sectional in nature. In a place where senior police officers like Chief Superintendents of Police are without posting, an unconfirmed and incompetent Assistant Superintendent of Police is in charge of the investigation because he is a Muslim.\n\n\u201cThe post of PPRO is manned and left in the hands of an Inspector of police because he is a Muslim and so many other postings within the Academy. On Thursday 28the April 2022, he summoned the Chaplain and the Rev. Father and accused them of spreading the news that he is islamising the academy.\u201d\n\nAnother officer said the academy despite being a federal institution has been left in the hands of principal officers in acting capacity without official letters for more than three years.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is also sad to note that the Academy as a federal institution is left in the hands of people (principal officers) in acting capacity without official letters for more than 3 years just to be using them to siphon public funds.\n\n\u201cWorrisome to note is that the principal officers without confirmation of their appointments have been collecting and enjoying the emolument/salaries of the substantive ranks or offices they are occupying which is against financial regulations.\n\n\u201cThe appointments of Deans, Head of Departments, and other sections in the academy are issued to the loyalists of the acting coordinator who will not challenge their corrupt proclivities. Since its inception, the Academic Staff of the Academy has never benefitted from Earned Allowances as it is applicable in other public universities because of the incompetency of the management of the Academy.\n\n\u201cThis is conspicuous in the 4 weeks down tools embarked on by the Academy Staff after issuing a communique. Instead, the commandant issued sack threats. At the cadet's dining, cadets are separated because of the fasting of the Muslims with special meals and treatments for the Muslims and regular for that of Christian cadets.\n\n\u201cIt's not hyperbole to state that most Christian cadets no longer go to the dining because of fear that they might be poisoned having seen his Islamisation agenda, pending when the dining and meals will be merged.\n\n\u201cThe separation of the dining wouldn't have been a bad ideal but the perceived negative effects it might have on the Christian faithful are worrisome. Christians celebrated Easter without special meals or presents from the school but for the celebration of Eid-Fitri, two big cows for the Muslims which clearly showed that he is biased thus rendering him unfit to hold a public office.\n\n\u201cWith the introduction of the optional head scarfs for Muslim female serving police officers, the female cadets on training in the Academy now use scarfs. In the North where insurgency, kidnapping, and banditry attacks are prone to occur at any time, it could be a plan for the attackers to identify the Muslims and spare them.\u201d\n\nCalls put across by SaharaReporters to the Nigerian police spokesperson, Muyiwa Adejobi, were not picked nor returned.",

          "text": "The US supreme court is reportedly set to vote to overturn the law that legalised abortion.\n\nAccording to a report by Politico, this was disclosed in a leaked draft majority opinion written by Samuel Alito, a supreme court justice.\n\nAfter an initial vote among the justices subsequent to an oral argument, one is assigned the majority opinion and writes a draft on it. This is then circulated among the justices.\n\nA ruling is, however, only final when it is published by the court, as the vote alignment can sometimes change in between the initial vote and the ruling being released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opinion written by Alito strikes down Roe v Wade, the court\u2019s 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nIt also seeks to overturn a subsequent decision in 1992 that largely upheld that right.\n\nIt states that the Roe v. Wade decision that allowed abortions performed between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, before a fetus would be viable outside the womb, was wrongly decided because the US constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion,\u201d the draft reads.\n\n\u201cRoe was egregiously wrong from the start.

This is then circulated among the justices.\n\nA ruling is, however, only final when it is published by the court, as the vote alignment can sometimes change in between the initial vote and the ruling being released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opinion written by Alito strikes down Roe v Wade, the court\u2019s 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nIt also seeks to overturn a subsequent decision in 1992 that largely upheld that right.\n\nIt states that the Roe v. Wade decision that allowed abortions performed between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, before a fetus would be viable outside the womb, was wrongly decided because the US constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAbortion presents a profound moral question.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know Margaret Thatcher? Born on October 13, 1925, she was the only British Prime Minister in the twentieth century to win three consecutive terms.\n\nSignificantly, she accelerated the evolution of the British economy from statism to liberalism and became the most renowned British political leader since Winston Churchill, both in terms of personality and achievement.\n\nOn this day in 1979, Margaret Thatcher of the Conservative Party was elected British Prime Minister, becoming the first woman in Europe to hold that position; she later became the longest continuously serving British premier since 1827.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve enlightened or reminded you of history, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be talking about today:\n\nBank of Uganda warns crypto traders\n\nMental health care over data privacy\n\nSafaricom to protect customers\u2019 personal info\n\nBank of Uganda warns crypto traders\n\nThe Bank of Uganda (BOU) has urged all licenced companies under the National Payments Systems Act not to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions because crypto is not recognised as legal tender.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that owners of such financial assets are not protected if their holdings lose value. Also, the BOU said that no institution has been authorised to sell or facilitate the trade in cryptocurrencies.\n\nRing a bell? In February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) banned banks and other licenced financial institutions from handling cryptocurrency transactions and threatened severe penalties for violations.\n\nTo reduce demand for other digital tokens, Nigeria launched its virtual currency, the eNaira, backed by the CBN.\n\nYou can read this for more details: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nBut did the ban stop Nigerians from trading cryptocurrencies? Keep in mind that recently, in April 2022, Access Bank was slammed with a \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million) fine, Stanbic IBTC was fined \u20a6200 million ($481,000), while United Bank for Africa (UBA) had to pay \u20a6100 million ($240,000) because some crypto-related transactions slipped through without the banks detecting it.\n\nInterestingly, Paxful reveals that Nigeria is second only to the US in bitcoin trading. Also, Statista shows that Nigeria has the highest per capita rate of crypto ownership globally, at 31.9% in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, will the BOU\u2019s warning deter Ugandans from trading? If you want to share your thoughts on this, please share your thoughts in the comments section.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Uganda\u2019s monetary authorities claim that cryptocurrencies make it simple for criminals to use such assets for money laundering, the sale of illegal goods and services, and fraudulent ventures such as Ponzi and pyramid schemes.\n\nBut how true is that? Recall that last week, The Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt Bitcoin as a reference currency in a bid to put the country\u2019s plan for economic recovery and peacebuilding on track.\n\nSo, is Uganda implying that the CAR government is ignorant or didn\u2019t do their homework before adopting Bitcoin as legal tender?\n\nIn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, the editorial team had an interesting discussion about CAR\u2019s Bitcoin adoption. Bolu also has his reservations about the subject. You can listen to it here.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast, save a seat for yourself here.\n\nMental health care over data privacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nMay is Mental Health Awareness Month in the United States. This could be why Mozilla\u2019s study on mental health and prayer apps was released yesterday, May 2, 2022. The report contained the findings of an analysis of 32 mental health and religious applications.\n\nEssentially, these apps frequently deal with sensitive topics like depression, mental health awareness, anxiety, domestic violence, PTSD, and religious-themed services.\n\nWhat did the company discover? It revealed a startling disregard for user security and privacy in mental health and prayer apps. This implies that users\u2019 privacy is less protected in mental health and prayer apps than most other apps.\n\nSeriously, I\u2019m worried because I use 3 \u2014 7 Cups, Bearable, and Better Help \u2014 out of the 32 apps. What does this mean for me? Is my data at risk? On the flip side is the ever golden question: Are Africans concerned about data privacy and security?\n\nShall we take a poll to determine this? Interestingly, the editorial team discussed this in today\u2019s podcast. Team Ogheneruemu believes that Africans care about their data but lack alternatives, whereas team Oluwanifemi believes that most Africans do not care at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion? Do you care about your data or not? Leave your response in the comment section.\n\nBack to the story, according to Mozilla\u2019s latest *Privacy Not Included guide, despite the sensitive information these apps handle, they \u201croutinely share data, allow weak passwords, target vulnerable users with personalised ads, and feature vague and poorly written privacy policies,\u201d\n\nHow? Jen Caltrider, the Mozilla guide lead, said the apps are exceptionally creepy because \u201cthey track, share, and capitalise on users\u2019 most intimate personal thoughts and feelings, like moods, mental state, and biometric data.\u201d\n\nAlso, 29 of the 32 mental health and prayer apps reviewed received a \u201cprivacy not included\u201d warning label, indicating that the team was concerned about how the app managed user data.\n\nWhile mental health care is becoming popular in Africa, does this mean we are better off sticking to traditional mental health care? Especially considering the stigma and flack people get for going that route.\n\nEven though these apps typically make mental health care more accessible, the report suggests that access to mental health care may come at the expense of privacy. Still, once again, who cares about privacy? Will you choose data privacy over your mental health or vice-versa?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Banks already use this when sending debit or credit alerts to avoid disclosing client information.\n\nPreviously, the company claimed that people who pay for goods and services leave their phone numbers and names with thousands of merchants who use personal information like phone numbers and purchasing habits to send unsolicited advertising via text messages.\n\nAlso, in violation of Kenya\u2019s Data Protection Act passed in 2019, the information can be sold to third parties without consent.\n\nMoreover, this follows the discovery that more than a fifth of Kenyan businesses shared financial and personal information about their customers without their consent.\n\nPer a survey conducted by Ernst & Young, 41% of firms transferred client data to third-party service providers, while more than 53% of these companies did not seek customer approval.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHere are the confirmed speakers for the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook holding company Meta has gotten off to a rough start in its efforts to create a metaverse as popular as its flagship platform. The company lost an estimated $10 billion in 2021 on metaverse-related initiatives alone, and its share price has plummeted.\n\nUndeterred, Chinese tech goliath ByteDance is busy planning a metaverse of its own, tentatively poised as an Eastern-inflected version of Meta\u2019s effort. Both companies have invested huge amounts in VR hardware\u2014Facebook by acquiring Oculus for a reported $2 billion, ByteDance through a $1.4 billion acquisition of Chinese headset manufacturer Pico. Both have followed roughly the same playbook, hoping that an early foothold in the looming contest of metaverses will secure a large and loyal customer base for their commercial offerings.\n\nMushe (XMU) recently made a less publicized announcement of its own planned metaverse, but the details should interest anyone interested in virtual commercialization. Like its better-known peers, the MusheVerse will feature a marketplace for virtual goods, including virtual land and NFTs. It also allows users to earn XMJ tokens for gaming, employing a play-to-earn model alongside a reward incentive program.\n\nBut the MusheVerse are on a groundbreaking journey that rival metaverses dare not emulate: offering full financial integration with other metaverses. Its governing Mushe Token (XMU) is designed to be compatible with multiple blockchains and metaverses. This makes the MusheVerse both a compelling metaverse in its own right and a hub for users to explore whatever metaverse they choose, safe in the knowledge that their existing cryptocurrency holdings will be honored wherever they go.\n\nXMU will also integrate with fiat-based financial services, Mushe\u2019s roadmap mentions a partnership with a digital banking app which will make a long-sought-after bridge between financial realms. Mushe\u2019s flexibility and interoperability have already earned the attention of savvy investors: as of this writing, XMU has risen more than threefold in the first two weeks of its presale, giving investors reason to expect an enormous return when the currency officially launches on July 4, 2022.\n\nThis study in contrast is as fresh as the idea of the metaverse and as old as commerce. On the one hand, Facebook and ByteDance are seeking to develop large, highly detailed, largely proprietary metaverses centred around their commercial interests. On the other hand, Mushe World is developing the MusheVerse on the principle that metaverses, and the currencies used within them, should be traversed as freely and easily as possible. Early returns suggest that investors find the MusheVerse more compelling at the moment, and a more interesting long-term proposition as well.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration: https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has affirmed the government\u2019s zero tolerance for street begging, noting that the state will begin the arrest and prosecution of parents of out-of-school children, as part of efforts to tackle the menace of street begging in the state.\n\nObaseki said this when he received Muslim faithful who were at the Government House, Benin City to celebrate the Eid-El Fitr after the successful completion of the Ramadan fast.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWe believe that basic education is the right for every Edo child; it\u2019s their right and it\u2019s free and compulsory. We will link education with street begging and street children.\n\n\u201cIn the next few weeks or months, we will not allow street begging in Edo anymore. We have farm settlements and we need hands and labour to cultivate foods. People arrested from where they are begging will be evacuated to the farm settlements to work and if they don\u2019t want to work, they will be sent back to where they come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just employed 3,062 teachers in the rural communities as they have just finished their training.

You also engaged in capacity building as you interchanged skills and made your colleagues here locally improve their knowledge. They have learned new ways of doing things. You have brought a new way of commitment and dedication to duty.\n\n\u201cYou have fulfilled your call of service to humanity as the team restored lives during this mission by providing free medical service.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the activities of ANPA in Edo State have helped the government rethink the issue of brain drain, adding, \u201cYou are in the position to help us tackle brain drain. This mission has been so helpful as I believe that we can do two missions per year. Your services to Edo people are invaluable to the healthcare regeneration of our state and country at large.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cTo transform or reform any healthcare system in the world, we must focus on the people. It\u2019s about the quality of human capacity and development. I am grateful to God that we have you. We need to organise ourselves to receive the value you are ready to give us.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ehanire has commended the collaboration between ANPA and the state government, noting, \u201cNigeria suffers from brain drains as the country\u2019s medical personnel have left to practice abroad. It\u2019s difficult to stop them despite several plans as it affects not only Nigeria but across the globe.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI applaud the plan for telemedicine which has been experimented in America during the COVID-19 era with the help of technology which became very useful over there. Technology allows for virtual consultation between experts in the Diaspora and their patients here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe would like to institutionalize such a relationship to enable us share knowledge and skills and begin to develop the health sector here in Nigeria. We are waiting for the signature of the president to create the National Health Insurance Commission that will make health insurance mandatory for all Nigerians and increase the physical space for health.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAs the race for the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress gathers momentum, the Asiwaju Musulumi of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta, Dr Khamis Olatunde-Badmus has argued that every Yoruba ought back Bola Tinubu, former Lagos State governor, for president in 2023.\n\nHe advised Yemi Osinbajo, the country\u2019s vice president and APC presidential hopeful, to drop his ambition in deference to Tinubu.\n\nThe elder statesman urged the other aspirants to consider the roles Asiwaju Bola Tinubu played in their success stories and desist from contesting the APC with him.\n\nHe added that almost all Southwest states had benefited from Tinubu.\n\nOlatunde Badmus, while addressing journalists in Osogbo on Monday, asked Osinbajo, former governor of Ekiti State, Mr Ayodele Fayose, and others to allow Tinubu, being the oldest among them and first to formally declare interest to clinch the ticket, stressing that failure to do this would divide the over 12 million votes that would come from the Southwest.\n\nAccording to the influential businessman, all other presidential aspirants had at one time or the other got tremendous assistance from Tinubu, adding that they should allow wisdom to prevail by stepping down for the former governor of Lagos State.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat I am after is the unity of this country and that Yorubas, we are important race in Nigeria today. In a race where we have about seven or eight of our children now coming to say they want to be president, whereas, there is only one vacant seat. And is it not a way of dividing the about 12 to 13 million votes that Yorubas have? If you have been able to give respect to whom respect is due, we know ourselves and we know who is elderly among us and we know who and who has contributed to our lives.\n\n\u201cIs it part of the Yoruba culture to say that somebody by one way or the other has contributed to one thing or the other about your life and you now believe that that person will be an opponent to you. So, what I am just saying is that only God knows who will be the next president of Nigeria but in Yoruba, the area we are is that we should not divide our votes because it is not going to benefit us and that has been my empasis. The person that you might see me together with is Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He came out first to say he wants to be president and that\u2019s the only person that has approached me. That\u2019s the only person that I am aware of, the other one, I am not aware of.\n\n\u201cMy message is that this man (Tinubu) played a major role in each life of everybody that has become whatever they are today. He doesn\u2019t discrimate against Christians and he doesn\u2019t discrimate against Muslim. Go and check the history of Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, 90 percent of those who are managing him today are Christians. The wife of Asiwaju is one of the Senior Pastors at Redeemed Christian Church of God and all his children are in the Churches. It\u2019s we Muslims that we say are we not building more Christians by giving our votes to Bola Ahmed Tinubu. But, we are not complaining.\n\n\u201cTell me any state in Southwest that Tinubu does not have contributions as to who and who becomes the governor. Will Fayemi say Tinubu didn\u2019t contribute to his being a governor? Will Osinbajo say he was not an Attorney General under Tinubu? You should give respect to elders. Will Aregbesola say he didn\u2019t benefit from him? But they may have their own differences but I believe there is a need for wisdom to prevail on them so that they can sit down together and say leader is a leader. The ego is going to be there and by the time they do their convention, it\u2019s one person that will emerge. Even if they are pushing you, common sense should prevail,\u201d the Muslim leader opined.",

          "title": "2023: Bury zoning, bury Nigeria \u2013 South/Middle belt leaders warn",
          "text": "The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has issued a warning to those trying to abandon zoning of the presidency in the country, saying any attempt to end zoning, as being mentioned in some northern quarters, would spell the end for Nigeria.\n\nThe leaders condemned a statement credited to the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Alhaji Ango Abdullahi, that rotation of the presidency between the north and south was \u201cdead and buried\u201d.\n\nAccording to them, another eight years of northern presidency, after President Muhammadu Buhari, was unacceptable.\n\nThe position of the leaders was contained in a joint statement on Monday by National Leader, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and Chairman, SMBLF, Chief Edwin Clark; leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor; and National President, Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus. They said they were prepared for those attempting to upturn a practice \u2013 zoning \u2013 that had sustained the country.\n\nThe group warned that any attempt to kill and bury the age-long power rotation agreement between the north and south was tantamount to an attempt to kill and bury Nigeria.\n\nSMBLF warned that the move to tinker with the rotation of the presidency was inimical to national unity.\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt leaders also warned Abdullahi\u2019s NEF, and wondered if the northern body was now out to dissolve the country.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cSMBLF says it is rather unfortunate and absurd that Ango Abdullahi and his Northern Elders Forum would make such twaddle. Are they now ready to dissolve the country? What has happened that zoning, which has been a sine qua non in the nation\u2019s political progression, has now become a \u2018dead and buried\u2019 issue, in the irrational contemplations of Ango Abdullahi and his co-travellers?\n\n\u201cCould it be due to the incapacity, insipidity and disastrous performance of the Buhari administration or the narcissistic desire to perpetuate Hausa/Fulani hegemony? It has become necessary to underscore that Ango Abdullahi, with his established disposition of inconsistency and duplicity, is one of the people disturbing the polity and peace of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, this same Ango fumbled with the idea of a so-called consensus arrangement for northern presidential aspirants, he has not come out of it. Now he has sprung up with this reckless statement that zoning is dead and buried. Ango and his northern elders do not have the power to kill and bury zoning. If they want to kill and bury Nigeria, then we are ready for them.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesmen stated that the \u201chistory of zoning between the north and the south is well-known to everybody in this country and has been respected by all the major political parties in Nigeria.\u201d They recalled that all the ruling political parties from the Second Republic, such as the now defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and the current opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had adhered to the principle of zoning.\n\nThe elders also accused the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Adamu Abdullahi, of outright dishonesty and chicanery for saying APC had not decided the zoning of the presidency.\n\nAccording to SMBLF, \u201cMore so, earlier this year, the nation and global audience were told by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on a national/satellite television station, Channels Television, that zoning of the party and political elective offices exists in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe governor further hinted that all the positions earlier held by the north would be swapped with the south and vice versa. And this was inclusive of the presidency. That was the reason why only northerners vied for the national chairmanship of the party, which was zoned to the north and micro-zoned to the North-central, during the party\u2019s national convention in March this year.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are now being told by the newly \u2018imposed\u2019 national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu that the APC has not decided on the zoning of the presidency. Such a statement at this stage, with about 30 days to the presidential primaries, amounts to outright dishonesty and chicanery. Who are they trying to deceive and who will allow them?\n\n\u201cIt becomes even more upsetting given the fact that the statement came from someone who himself emerged as National Chairman of the APC through the policy of rotation and zoning.\u201d\n\nThe southern leaders added, \u201cIt is haughty for anybody to say that this is the time to consider the quality of candidates. Where in Nigeria is deficient in quality candidates? Is it the south or the north? Everyone of the individuals from the south, who has indicated interest to contest for the presidency, both in APC and in PDP, is qualified to be President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey should stop their trickery. Enough is enough! We cannot have a northerner president for eight years and then welcome another northern president for another eight years or more. That is unacceptable to us. We, therefore, strongly caution all our governors, former governors, and top politicians not to accept the vice presidency nomination from any northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe urge the 17 southern governors, who unanimously declared that the presidency must come to the south in May last year, at Asaba, Delta State, to remain resolute. They have our absolute support for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum and we stand firmly by them. This country belongs to all of us!\n\n\u201cLet everybody take this as a serious warning that the issue of zoning cannot be swept under the carpet; it cannot be dead and buried, if zoning is buried, Nigeria is, then, buried. And if they are thinking that this is a joke, let it be known that it is not. If we cannot abide by the established principle of rotation and zoning between the north and the south, then we should not continue with one Nigeria; we should go back to what we were as a people before the amalgamation of 1914.\n\n\u201cWe also earnestly call on the people of the Middle Belt Region and all minorities in Nigeria to wake up and work with conscience.\u201d",

R7, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, it is unconstitutional for the 2nd defendant (RMAFC) to refuse or neglect to upwardly review the salaries and allowances of the judicial officers notwithstanding the changing local and international socio-economic realities.\n\nThe plaintiff wants an order compelling the defendants to forthwith activate measures to urgently review judicial officers\u2019 pay, raising that of the CJN to a minimum of N12m monthly, N11m for other Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal President; N10m for other Justice of the Appeal Court, the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and President of the National Industrial Court (NIC).

          "text": "Imo East senatorial aspirant, Sir Basil Maduka has expressed concerns over the gradual collapse of Owerri, and the entire South East following the outbreak of insurgency, criminality, and economic survival.\n\nMaduka, founder of Virgin Petroleum Group lamented over what he described as the lack of active political participation of the South East zone which portends danger for the economy.\n\nThe Mbaise born technocrat and business mogul expressed these concerns during a media chat at his Akpodim in Ezinihiite Mbaise local government country home.\n\n\u201cI foresee political danger in the southeast because of the gradual collapse of our Monday economy and the tactical Friday shutdown which we use for burials. Am concerned that our people are not worried that the process will trigger criminality because it is a gradual shutdown of our economy. Our political Imo class do not realise that we are in a gradual self-destruct mode\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMaduka, a frontline aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said if elected into the red chambers, he will use the first four years to embark on massive enlightenment to awaken the interest of Imo youths to honest endeavour devoid of criminality.\n\n\u201cI have gone round Owerri zone and I can conveniently tell you that I have not seen any sign of industrial smoke to show presence of a factory anywhere. Rather what we have everywhere are hotels which if you ask me, do not produce any products, rather it is an avenue to spend money\u201d, he argued.\n\nFurther, he said \u201cSee the Sam Mbakwe International cargo airport lying down un-utilised for the intention and unable to harness the business opportunity of the entire southeast states, not forgetting that every state is building her own airport and thereby drawing away the potentials of our own. It is when you are politically positioned that you can be economically viable and I dare say that we are not as a people\u201d, Maduka said.\n\nAccording to him, the Yorubas have positioned Lagos as the commercial centre, the Hausas have Abuja and Kano as their nerve centres, Ndigbo have not developed any part of theirs to become the centre of economic activity even as he maintained that the gradual development of Owerri as the solution centre is threatened by insurgency and criminality.\n\nHe said \u201cYou will agree with me that until recently Owerri was positioned as the nerve of the Southeast. People trooped into our hotels just to unwind during weekends and the venue is Owerri. Unfortunately all that is about to erode us due to criminality and am very worried. Imo people are not grounded with experience about economy, and the implication is we can\u2019t influence anybody unlike the other regional giants. This should give us concerns because of what it may portend for our teeming unemployed youths\u201d.\n\nAccording to Maduka, the near absence of commercial activities has forced youths to embrace fraud saying \u201cOur able-bodied young men go into 419 and all forms of Internet frauds. A large number of them are already in jail or fighting to avoid going, but I believe we can re-orientate them to noble endeavours. We can stand surety for them to access working capital which will inturn develop others and that way, crime is reduced and the society is safer for us all. However, if we don\u2019t address it, criminality will take over and we will have no access to where we call home\u201d, the former Mandilas Accountant said.\n\nReacting to claims that his emergence will affect the chances of former Governor, Rt Hon Emeka Ihedioha to reclaim the office, Maduka said it was a lie saying \u201cThe proponents of Mbaise nation are enemies who don\u2019t mean well for our people. There is no way, Mbaise people will occupy all the positions if we have a Governor of Mbaise extraction. We alone can\u2019t occupy the office of Deputy Governor, Speaker, Chief of Staff, all the Commissioners, Head of Service, Chief Judge, including Special Advisers and Senior Special Assistants, it is not possible. We need the input of other people. I just believe it\u2019s an agenda of greed, self-centredness to subdue other peoples aspirations. It is an open secret that Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State and Senator Enyinna Abaribe hail from the same clan and yet both represent the state at different levels and places.\n\n\u201cLet me ask, what has the governor office attracted to us so far if we don\u2019t have factories and big places to show even when we have the highest number of graduates. Let me clearly state that I have a cordial relationship with Rt Hon Emeka Ihedioha and I have informed him about my Senate ambition. If I am elected a Senator, I will still support him as I have always done. However political jobbers should not use dishonest means to thwart the narrative\u201d, Maduka stated.\n\nAccording to him, leadership is not just about tarred roads but involved enabling environment for businesses to thrive even as he lamented that agitations and hunger were biting hard within the state and Southeast zone.\n\nFurther, he said \u201cwe need to change the narrative in Owerri zone and as well find means to keep the teeming unemployed youths who are our brothers and sisters busy with meaningful job opportunities to pave way for lasting peace and development.\u201d\n\nMaduka maintained that he needs a platform where some of the challenges facing the people would be met by using his wide contacts and reach to make difference in the life of Ndi-Owerri zone.\n\nHe explained that his quest to represent Owerri people in the Senate is not about going there to fight or make noise but to use the position to attract more dividends of democracy to Ndi-Owerri zone and to the state at large.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSir Basil Maduka, a renowned humanitarian and philanthropist who has touched so many lives through his benevolence and kind gesture appealed to PDP delegates, leaders and stakeholders to make their choice according to their conscience which should be centered on competence as regards who will fly the party\u2019s flag at the forthcoming general election.\n\nHe assured the people of Owerri Zone that he will disappoint them if given the opportunity to serve them in the Senate come 2023.",

In Shiroro local government, some of those abducted for over a month around the boundaries with Munya and Kaduna state are still in captivity,\u201d a villager revealed.\n\nAn attempt to get the official figure of those still in captivity from the state police command did not succeed as he could not be reached at the time of filing this report.\n\nOf the 1,908 Nigerians kidnapped and 4,233 killed between January and April 2022, the fatalities include security personnel, terrorists, bandits, victims of communal clashes and herdsmen invading communities in the period under review.\n\nAnalysing data collected through the Nigeria Security Tracker (NST) between 2015 and June 2021, Hum Angle observed a growing trend in the number of mass abductions and the total number of victims of kidnapping in Nigeria.

The gunmen also killed a police officer during the attack.\n\nThere were reports that Nigerian security forces rescued eight students and three teachers who were from among some 100 people abducted from the school in northwest Kebbi State.\n\nAuthorities said the kidnappers killed three of the students and they are looking for those still believed to be held captive for ransom.\n\nTroops, however, also recovered the bodies of the dead students. Two of them had been shot in the legs while one was believed to have died of exhaustion.\n\nIn late May, 2021, about 200 students of an Islamiyya school in Niger State were also abducted by gunmen.\n\nSome 14 students and staff of Greenfield University in Kaduna were released in May after parents reportedly paid over N150 million ransom and bought eight motorcycles for the bandits.\n\nIn December 27, 2021, reports from Zamfara state revealed that bandits kidnapped over 20 women following attacks in 15 villages within the neighbourhood of Gusau, the state capital.\n\nIn 2022, the breakdown shows that in January, 400 persons were kidnapped while 939 were killed, whereas in February 605 persons were kidnapped and 1202 killed.\n\nFurthermore, in March there were 702 persons kidnapped and 1497 deaths.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRelatedly in April 2022, Nigeria recorded 201 abductions and 595 killings.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Nigeria said they rescued 1,398 kidnapped victims in the month of April while the victims of Abuja-Kaduna train have now spent more than one month with their abductors despite presidential directive.\n\nWhen contacted on the fate of the kidnapped victims of Kaduna train attack, the Director Defence Information, Major General Jimmy Akpor, kept mum.

In Shiroro local government, some of those abducted for over a month around the boundaries with Munya and Kaduna state are still in captivity,\u201d a villager revealed.\n\nAn attempt to get the official figure of those still in captivity from the state police command did not succeed as he could not be reached at the time of filing this report.\n\nOf the 1,908 Nigerians kidnapped and 4,233 killed between January and April 2022, the fatalities include security personnel, terrorists, bandits, victims of communal clashes and herdsmen invading communities in the period under review.\n\nAnalysing data collected through the Nigeria Security Tracker (NST) between 2015 and June 2021, Hum Angle observed a growing trend in the number of mass abductions and the total number of victims of kidnapping in Nigeria. While in 2017, there were 484 kidnap victims, the figure grew to 987 the following year, then 1,386 in 2019 and 2,860 in 2020.\n\nBetween January 1 and June 30, 2021, at least 2,944 people were kidnapped, making 2021 the worst year yet based on this security index.\n\nSome of the major kidnappings in 2021 include the storming Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri in Kebbi State, where about 66 students and four teachers were abducted on June 16. The gunmen also killed a police officer during the attack.\n\nThere were reports that Nigerian security forces rescued eight students and three teachers who were from among some 100 people abducted from the school in northwest Kebbi State.\n\nAuthorities said the kidnappers killed three of the students and they are looking for those still believed to be held captive for ransom.\n\nTroops, however, also recovered the bodies of the dead students. Two of them had been shot in the legs while one was believed to have died of exhaustion.\n\nIn late May, 2021, about 200 students of an Islamiyya school in Niger State were also abducted by gunmen.\n\nSome 14 students and staff of Greenfield University in Kaduna were released in May after parents reportedly paid over N150 million ransom and bought eight motorcycles for the bandits.\n\nIn December 27, 2021, reports from Zamfara state revealed that bandits kidnapped over 20 women following attacks in 15 villages within the neighbourhood of Gusau, the state capital.\n\nIn 2022, the breakdown shows that in January, 400 persons were kidnapped while 939 were killed, whereas in February 605 persons were kidnapped and 1202 killed.\n\nFurthermore, in March there were 702 persons kidnapped and 1497 deaths.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRelatedly in April 2022, Nigeria recorded 201 abductions and 595 killings.\n\nThe Armed Forces of Nigeria said they rescued 1,398 kidnapped victims in the month of April while the victims of Abuja-Kaduna train have now spent more than one month with their abductors despite presidential directive.\n\nWhen contacted on the fate of the kidnapped victims of Kaduna train attack, the Director Defence Information, Major General Jimmy Akpor, kept mum. It was same with the Director of Defence Media Operations, Major General Benard Onyeuko,\n\nThe Defence Headquarters in April said troops rescued 848 captives from terrorists, killed 85 ,arrested 119 terrorists while 1,158 terrorists and their families surrendered within three weeks in the North East and North West.\n\nMajor General Benard Onyeuko who disclosed this during the biweekly update on the Armed Forces of Nigeria operations between 7-28 April 2022 said the troops also arrested Abdurrazaq Hudu, a logistics supplier of Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) at Mutum Biyu village in Gassol local government area of Taraba State.\n\nIn the same vein, troops of the Nigerian Army deployed for Operation Hadin Kai conducting a subsidiary Operation Desert Sanity killed several terrorists and rescued 550 women and children in the North East, including mother of popular dreaded Boko Haram Commander known as Alhaji Ari Hajja Fusambe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome of the major timeline of abduction and rescue in 2022 include: in January 2022, 30 abducted students of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State and a teacher regained their freedom after spending seven months in captivity.\n\nYahaya Sarki, the special adviser on Media to Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, confirmed the release.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government confirmed that 14 students out of those abducted with their teachers from the Federal Government College Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, are yet to be released by their abductors.\n\nMinister of State for Education, Hon Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, gave the confirmation while presenting his keynote address at the national campaign on out of school children in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State.\n\nAlso, in January 2022, invading terrorists in Dankade village under Zuru emirate in Kebbi state killed at least 16 civilians, a one-armed policeman and a soldier.\n\nAccording to the Kebbi State police command PRO, DSP Nafiu Abubakar, the bandits were engaged by Police and the military forcing the bandits to leave their targets.\n\nIn January 2022, dozens of gunmen on motorbikes ransacked a village and killed more than 50 people in Kebbi.\n\nOn March 8, 2022 , gunmen ambushed and killed at least 62 members of a volunteer vigilante group in Nigeria\u2019s northwestern Kebbi state, the head of the group and a police spokesman said, in the worst violence to hit the state since mid-January.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists bombed the Abuja to Kaduna train, killing about nine and abducting unspecified number of passengers.\n\nAfter about 36 days in captivity, some victims are still being held in captivity.\n\nOn April 13, bandits abducted five female students of Zamfara College and threatened to marry off the victims.\n\nGunmen Behead Military Couple In Imo\n\nMeanwhile, gunmen have shot dead and also beheaded a couple in Imo State who are personnel of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe couple, a master warrant officer and lance corporal, were on transit when they met the criminals who killed them on Saturday and made videos and circulated online.\n\nThe Director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, who confirmed the incident, said the Army had commenced investigation, adding that those behind the ugly incident will be brought to book.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve the report, that a couple, both of them soldiers, were intercepted by criminals and killed in cold-blood on their way to Imo State and the criminals even made a video and circulated it.

          "title": "Border Re-opening: Importers, Agents Recount Losses Of 2-year Closure",
          "text": "Importers and clearing agents operating at the nation\u2019s land borders have condemned the federal government for shutting down the borders for two years.\n\nRecounting their experience to LEADERSHIP, they said that the border closure led to nothing beneficial to the economy, instead it brought hardship and suffering to them, the agents, importers and traders at the border communities.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the federal government last Friday approved the re-opening of Idiroko, Jibiya, Kamba and Ikom borders. Also, in 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari announced the re-opening of Seme, Illela, Maigatari and Mfun borders.\n\nThe borders were shut in 2019 by the president to protect Nigerian farmers and combat the smuggling of foreign parboiled rice, frozen poultry and vehicles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, stakeholders in the maritime sector have bemoaned the shutting of the nation\u2019s land borders, saying the nation lost everything and gained nothing from the border closure.\n\nAn importer, Gideon Pedro Aremu, said the border closure did not really achieve anything for the government except the hardship, losses, and suffering it brought upon the traders and the entire border communities.\n\nAccording to him, importers and exporters around the borders lost no less than N4.3 trillion while over 1,450 small businesses have closed shop due to the closure of the borders between 2019 and 2022\n\n\u201cI am an importer and I have been doing business around Nigerian borders for about four decades now. I do business around all these borders and I know how things work when it comes to transacting business.\n\n\u201cWithin the period the borders were shut, a lot of importers went bankrupt, as most of them could not pay back the loans they collected from the bank.\n\n\u201cWhen I said we lost N4.3trillion, I know what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m not exaggerating at all. The N4.3 trillion was not even part of the revenue that Customs commands around these borders were losing annually. You can see the negative effects of the border closure. We advised the government on the adverse effects but they wouldn\u2019t listen. It was a wrong decision and a bad one for that matter on the part of the government,\u201d Aremu said.\n\nOn his part, the chairman of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), Idiroko border, Elder Abel Ayokunle said, \u201cWhat we went through in the last three years of the border closure was just like when you arrest a criminal and put in detention and he has nobody to cry to and nothing to be done until when God intervenes.\n\n\u201cIt has been a bad experience for the communities and the inhabitants of the area. You know they live together with the French people, which means you can easily run down to the other side and buy things, but this time around everywhere was totally locked down. We couldn\u2019t do anything. So we have been in prison for many years,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, it is a good thing for the government to reopen the border as the closure had rendered the economy and business activities useless.\n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t even trade. Even when you go to Lagos to buy things and you are bringing it to Idiroko, you will be arrested, molested, and subjected to serious harassment on the road by the law enforcement agents from Owode to Idiroko which is around 36 kilometres and you will pay for what you bought in Nigeria.\n\nThe area has become another republic. It was a bad experience. It is now we have gained a little freedom because these men are still on the road extorting people. The security agencies should be dismantled and the road will go back to its normal level where we have only Customs, maybe in three places.\u201d\n\nOn his part, chairman, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), Idiroko Border, Uche Nwabude, said when the borders were shut, so many people went through lots of hardship, adding that now that the borders have been opened, it would bring succour and relief to people.\n\nHe said the Idiroko was officially reopened on Monday and business activities are yet to pick up, but after the long holidays, it is expected to pick up and business activities will begin.\n\nAccording to the national president, National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA), Lucky Amiwero, shutting the border is a primitive way of securing the country, with many businessmen losing huge amounts to the border closure.\n\nAmiwero stated that other West Africa countries will be wary of doing business with Nigeria due to its antecedent in trade decisions.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe achieved nothing, our closing the border didn\u2019t achieve anything. Before closing the border, how much was rice? Now, is it cheaper? Closing the border is not the best for anything because the border is not supposed to be closed for anything.\n\n\u201cWhere in the world do you see people closing their borders? unless there is a coup or emergency and nothing like happened to us, but what we have is smuggling and what we are supposed to do to change the whole system is what we call mutual administrative assistance. This is a convention on Customs matters and that convention helps to tackle border crimes. We have two of these in Customs and the third one is universal and we should have gone into mutual agreement with Chad, Niger and Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cThe convention is what America is operating as they are not closing any borders. If I may ask, who is closing borders at this time? it\u2019s a primitive way of operating as you don\u2019t need to close your borders. We have the ECOWAS treaty and there is ETLS goods, but we just closed the whole thing and it won\u2019t give us credibility as a nation and the trust to deal with us. Government should tell us what they gained during the border closure,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso weighing in on the matter, the national president, National Association of Freight Forwarders and Air Consolidators (NAFFAC), Prince Adeyinka Bakare, maintained that the government should equip the land borders with technology to curb smuggling.\n\nAccording to him, there are lots of illegal routes where contrabands still find their way into the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have lots of unapproved entry and exit points, and what is the personnel of the security agencies? What is their capacity to police the borders and the unapproved routes that we have?

          "text": "\n\nBy Akeem Abas/Ibadan\n\nFormer Gov. Rasheed Ladoja of Oyo State said the exorbitant fees charged for nomination forms by APC and PDP will boost corruption.\n\nLadoja slammed the parties on Monday while fielding questions from journalists at his Ibadan residence.\n\nThe interview came after Ladoja, the Osi-Olubadan of Ibadan had joined other Muslims to observe the Eid prayers at University of Ibadan Central Mosque.\n\nHe said that the high cost of nomination form charged by the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) and Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) would have negative effect on the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nHe said that the arrogance of the two political parties will force politicians to embezzle public funds.\n\nHe advised that candidates should be picked based on their manifesto and not money.\n\nLadoja faulted claims by the parties that the exorbitant fee would separate contenders from pretenders, saying they are only encouraging their candidates to go and steal public funds when elected.\n\n\u201cIt is very ridiculous to ask a presidential aspirant to pick nomination form for N100 million and governorship nomination form for N50m. This is pure arrogance from the parties.\n\n\u201cYou are asking a presidential aspirant to seek a job of N56 million with a form of N100 million. Same thing with the governorship. You are asking an aspirant to pay N50 million to seek a job of N28 million in four years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former governor said that the arrogance of the two parties would drop if other parties win election in some states.\n\n\u201cOther political parties charge less than APC and PDP. If other parties can also win elections in some states, the arrogance of the two major political parties will drop.\n\n\u201cThese parties should understand that they are not the masters, but the people. They are just stampeding people thinking that they would vote for them either they like or not,\u201d he said.\n\nLadoja urged the political parties to imbibe the lessons of Ramadan in their activities as political activities commenced in the country ahead of 2023.\n\nHe said that Ramadan taught the people to imbibe tolerance, love, giving and sacrifice, saying such if imbibed would promote healthy competition as well as peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe Ibadan Chief enjoined the people to live in harmony, while adhering to their righteous deeds during the Ramadan period",

          "text": "By Kadiri Abdulrahman\n\nSome stakeholders in the country\u2019s economic sector have advised the Federal Government to take steps to halt the rising national debt stock as it is fast becoming unsustainable.\n\nThe stakeholders spoke in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nThey advised the Federal Government to look inwards and devise creative means of generating revenue rather than depending on borrowings.\n\nRecently, the Debt Management Office (DMO) announced that the country\u2019s total debt stock as of December 2021 was N39.55 trillion.\n\nAlso, the DMO had said that the debt stock was likely to hit N45 trillion in 2022, as the government planned to borrow an additional N6.30 trillion to finance the 2022 budget deficit.\n\nPatience Oniha, the Director-General of the DMO, had explained that the overall deficit in the 2022 budget was N6.30 trillion, representing 3.46 per cent of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nOniha explained that the debt stock was made up of the domestic and external debt stocks of the Federal Government, the 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nShe said that the country did not really have a debt problem, but a revenue problem, adding that the government was already taking practical steps to improve revenue and reduce borrowings.\n\nA breakdown of Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock shows that 37.82 per cent is external, while the balance of 62.18 per cent is domestic.\n\nHowever, with the country\u2019s national debt in relation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 35.51 per cent, some analysts suggested that the debt situation was still within reasonable limits.\n\nA financial expert, Mr Ibrahim Aliu, advised the Federal Government to devise creative means of generating revenue and move the country\u2019s economy away from perpetual dependence on debt.\n\nAliu advised that any further borrowings by the country should be strictly expended on productive ventures that could grow the economy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should ensure that borrowings are minimal and that future borrowings are effectively expended for real economic growth,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Sule Adebayo, a Chartered, Accountant, said that in spite of the low Debt-to-GDP ratio, the revenue that went into debt servicing was still on the high side.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to take necessary steps to improve its revenue and reduce its dependence on loans.\n\nAccording to Dr Tope Fasua, an economist, the government will need to optimise revenue generation to cut down on borrowings.\n\nFasua urged the private sector to always cooperate with the government in its revenue drive rather than antagonising such initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe private sector kicks anytime government proposes a tax increase, no matter how insignificant. It has turned itself into an enemy of the government, \u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, disagreed with the DMO that Nigeria had a \u201crevenue problem\u201d and not a debt problem while urging the government to get its expenditure priorities right.\n\n\u201cWe have a debt problem, we have a revenue problem and we have an expenditure problem.\n\n\u201cRight now we are just borrowing one way. We even borrow to service previous borrowings, \u201d he said.\n\nNAN",

          "text": "The Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) Monday said the inalienable right to access and disseminate information through an independent press is under attack in Nigeria.\n\nThe body therefore called for an urgent need to protect the media, saying \u201cdemocracy is in danger when a free press is threatened.\u201d\n\nThe NGE made the position known in a statement to commemorate the World Press Freedom Day(WPFD) observed May 3 every year.\n\nA statement by the NGE President Mustapha Isah and General Secretary Iyobosa Uwugiaren, said \u201cwhile the threat to the media freedom in Nigeria is real, the impact on the state of democracy in the country will be very dangerous, if not checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday is a day globally, to remind governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom. It is also a day of reflection among journalists and other media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind governments at all levels in Nigeria that a free and independent media that can keep the people informed and hold leaders accountable, is essential for a strong and sustainable democracy, including free and fair elections. Without it, Nigerians cannot make informed decisions about how they are governed; and address human rights abuses, corruption and abuse of power,\u201d the editors stated.\n\nThe Guild further said its members were concerned that \u201celected leaders in Nigeria, who should be press freedom\u2019s dependable protectors, have made several overt attempts to silence the media voices through proposed legislations that clearly seek to criminalise journalism practice in the country.\u201d\n\nThe editors added that \u201capart from the regular attacks on journalists carrying out their legitimate editorial assignments by overzealous security agents, the current attempts to criminalise journalism practice in the country through obnoxious proposed laws, the suffocating economic environment and harsh political/economic policies of the federal government, have in the past few years, made it almost impossible for the media sector to carry out its constitutional responsibility for the benefit of the citizens.\u201d\n\nIt therefore said \u201cthere is an urgent need to protect the media; because the impact of the suffocating economic and political environment being created by the government will be very dangerous to our democracy. A threat to the media is a threat to our democracy.\n\n\u201cGovernments at all levels must take the lead in making sure that their actions do not inspire violations of press freedom. A democratic society like Nigeria should know that it has a crucial role to play in maintaining media freedom and facilitating access to public information.\n\n\u201cGovernment should regularly take strong and immediate action against any violations of media freedom \u2013 this should include speaking out against violence against journalists and authorities\u2019 failure/refusal to identify and prosecute attackers.\u201d\n\nThe NGE also called on the federal government to make newsprints, broadcast equipment and all other consumables in the media sector tax-free, in order to save the media from total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe media is a strong pillar of democracy; it is the oxygen of the democratic space; and there is urgent need by the federal government to make intervention to save it from collapsing,\u201d the editors added.\n\nBuhari cautions\n\nAlso speaking on the WPFD, President Muhammadu Buhari lauded the role of the Nigerian media in strengthening democracy.\n\nHe also commended the courage and determination of those who daily go the extra time, sometimes at great personal risks, to keep the society well informed.\n\nIn fostering the pursuit of journalism in the country, the president reiterated the Nigerian government\u2019s commitment to freedom of the press, pledging to continue ensuring the protection of the rights and privileges of journalists in the lawful performance of their professional duties.\n\nHe charged the Nigerian Press to use the WPFD to reflect on the need to embrace the best professional standards and practices, especially in the build-up to the forthcoming general elections.\n\nHe said the free performance of media roles and responsibilities during the electoral process is as important as the sanctity and will of Nigerians, expressed through the ballot box.\n\nWith the elections in sight, he urged the media \u201cto be mindful of sponsored political news or publications capable of inciting hatred, division, violence, and chaos in the country, while also ensuring that the electoral umpire and other stakeholders play their roles in delivering free, fair, credible and transparent elections to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe must stay united in supporting media professionals who work hard to de-escalate violent conflict and promote peaceful societies without compromising the responsibility to report.\u201d\n\nThe president also urged government information managers to ensure the press and the general public have access to facts and figures of government information, without tears.\n\nIn line with the theme of this year\u2019s World Press Freedom Day, \u201dJournalism under digital siege,\u201d President Buhari assured that government agencies under his watch would always stand against actions capable of limiting the preservation of the freedom of the Press guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nHe said the federal government was working hard to support media organisations in Nigeria through provision of better internet access to underserved communities, and achieve 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030.\n\nHe thanked \u201cmembers of the Fourth Estate of the Realm whose diligent work help in guaranteeing peace, stability, and progress in the country.\u201d\n\nIPI Nigeria holds symposium\n\nAnd as part of the activities marking the day, the International Press Institute (IPI) Nigeria will hold a one-day symposium in collaboration with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).\n\nA statement by IPI Nigeria Secretary Ahmed I. Shekarau said the symposium holds Friday, May 6, 2022, at the National Press Centre, Radio House, Area 8, Garki, Abuja.\n\nThe statement said a former Director General of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Prof. Tonnie Iredia, would be the guest speaker at the symposium.\n\nThe statement said further that Prof. Iredia, who is now a lecturer in Mass Communication at the Nasarawa state University, will speak on \u201cWhat Journalists and Media in Nigeria Need to Do to Keep Safe, Retain Credibility and be Sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe statement lists as panelists to discuss the former NTA DG\u2019s presentation, the Senior Special Assistant on Media to the First Lady, Hon. Muhammad Sani Zorro; President of the National Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Mrs. Ladi Bala and the Nigeria Police Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi.\n\nThe panel discussion, according to the statement, will be moderated by the Editor-in-Chief of LEADERSHIP, Mr. Azubuike Ishiekwene.\n\nAccording to the statement, the event to be graced by top media leaders, editors and reporters, kicks off at 10am.\n\nIt also announced that provision has been made for remote participation by stakeholders who may not be at the venue of the event. The Zoom link for virtual participation is as follows: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87905583791?pwd=dnpuV3NRM2RjdEd5QVhqV2E2cVEzdz09\n\nMeeting ID: 879 0558 3791\n\nPasscode: qV94NB\n\n356 media freedom attacks\n\nIn a related development the International Press Institute (IPI) has documented 356 attacks on journalists, acts of censorship and serious violations of media freedom since the beginning of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, according to the latest figures.\n\nPublished ahead of World Press Freedom Day May 3, the data from IPI\u2019s Ukraine War Press Freedom Tracker underscores the devastating toll the conflict has already taken on independent journalism, media freedom and the safety of journalists in both countries.\n\nSeven journalists and media workers in Ukraine have so far been killed in the line of duty since February 24, according to IPI monitoring.\n\nThere is evidence at least two more may have been killed by Russian troops in occupied territory in apparent connection to their profession.\n\nIPI has also documented 33 serious cases of domestic and foreign journalists reporting from the frontlines in Ukraine being attacked, shot at, or caught in shelling, with many being hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nThis includes 21 journalists either sustaining gunshot wounds or coming under fire and at least 12 members of reporting crews being injured or caught in shelling and other airstrikes.\n\nAt least five journalists have been kidnapped or abducted, with some undergoing torture, beatings and other human rights abuses at the hands of Russian soldiers.\n\nDozens of regional media outlets have been forced to shut due to threats and newsroom seizures. IPI has documented four confirmed strikes on TV towers and infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nOverall, Russian state authorities and military forces have been responsible for 76% of all press freedom violations linked to the conflict documented by IPI over the last three months.\n\nMassive repression in Russia\n\nAlso in Russia, where the Kremlin has moved to wipe out all remaining sources of independent news and information, at least 114 media and news websites have been blocked by the Roskomnadzor regulator, making up 32% of all recorded violations on IPI\u2019s Tracker.\n\nAt least 10 major broadcasters or publications have since been shuttered or forced to cease operations altogether, including many of the last bastions of independent news such as Novaya Gazeta, Ekho Moskvy and Dozhd.\n\nIPI documented 49 incidents of media professionals being detained as they covered anti-war protests in cities across the country over the last three months. Many were arrested despite being in possession of journalistic identification.\n\nSo far, at least eleven journalists have been fined or detained under a restrictive new law criminalizing what authorities deem to be \u201cfake\u201d news about the armed forces. Hundreds of Russian journalists have reportedly since fled the country fearing prosecution.\n\nDozens of foreign media have also been forced to close their offices and pull their correspondents out of the country, contributing to a blackout for impartial coverage and leaving citizens increasingly isolated and exposed to pro-Kremlin propaganda.\n\n\u201cThese figures underscore the devastating toll this war has already taken on the lives of journalists as well as the scale of the human rights abuses and attacks on press freedom\u201d, IPI Executive Director Barbara Trionfi said. \u201cWe honour the courage of all journalists who continue to document the tragic human cost of this war in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\n\u201cIn Ukraine, journalists reporting from the front lines have lost their lives and other have faced attacks, abductions and torture. In Russia, the Kremlin has moved to systematically cleanse the media ecosystem of all impartial reporting on the war and eradicate what remained of the country\u2019s independent press.\n\n\u201cThese attacks in both countries cast a dark shadow over this year\u2019s World Press Freedom Day. They should also refocus the resolve of the international community to provide much needed support to the journalistic community in Ukraine and the independent Russia journalists driven into exile, while also safeguarding press freedoms at home.\n\n\u201cAs this appalling war continues, IPI will continue to do all we can to document every single attack on journalists and every act of censorship and violence against the press, to ensure a comprehensive record exists of the full scale of these assaults on journalistic freedoms.\u201d\n\nActs of censorship or restrictive regulations on independent journalism accounted for 46% of IPI\u2019s documented alerts, with 87% of these violations carried out by Russian authorities.\n\nArrests and criminal investigations and charges made up a further 25% of all recorded alerts, of which Russian police and security forces were responsible for 94% of cases.\n\nAttacks on journalists and media actors by Russian armed forces accounted for 14% of all documented alerts, though these include the most serious attacks and killings.\n\nRussian state authorities such as the government, prosecutors and regulators were responsible for an additional 61% of all recorded alerts.\n\nIPI\u2019s monitoring includes all violations of press freedom linked to the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile the vast majority of alerts were documented in the territory of Ukraine and Russia, the monitoring also covers Belarus and other states around the world.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026 As Edo approves N40,000 new minimum wage\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nEdo State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye has charged the Federal Government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment and hunger in the country.\n\nHe made the call yesterday during the 2022 Workers\u2019 Day in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has approved N40,000 as new minimum wage for workers in the state, in commemoration of this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nThe governor, who made the announcement while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 Day speech, said his government would continue to prioritise the welfare of Edo workers, equipping them with capacity and the environment to deliver efficient and quality service to the people.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend we do not know our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum wage for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\n\n\u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government. But as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nOn pensioners, he said he had approved, effective this month, the agreement reached with the Union of Pensioners that harmonised amount would be paid from this month.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by pensioners due to non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges,\u201d the governor added.",

From global health to the climate crisis, corruption, and human rights abuses, they face increased politicisation of their work and attempts to silence them from many sides.\n\n\u201cDigital technology has democratised access to information. But it has also created serious challenges. The business models of many social media platforms are based not on increasing access to accurate reporting, but on increasing engagement \u2013 which often means provoking outrage and spreading lies.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Oxygen Of Democracy,\u2019 NHRC Asks Nigerian Govt To Protect, Support Journalists\n\nAccording to the UN scribe, media workers in war zones are threatened not only by bombs and bullets but by the weapons of falsification and disinformation that accompany modern warfare.\n\nHe worried that such persons could be attacked as the enemy, accused of espionage, detained, or killed, simply for doing their jobs.\n\nDigital technology, Guterres stated, has also made censorship even easier as many journalists and editors around the world were at constant risk of their programmes and reports being taken offline.\n\nStressing that digital technology creates new channels for oppression and abuse, he lamented that women journalists were at particular risk of online harassment and violence.\n\n\u201cUNESCO found that nearly three in four women respondents had experienced online violence,\u201d the UN chief explained, adding \u201cHacking and illegal surveillance also prevent journalists from doing their jobs.\n\n\u201cThe methods and tools change, but the goal of discrediting the media and covering up the truth remains the same as ever. The results are also the same: people and societies that are unable to distinguish fact from fiction and can be manipulated in horrifying ways.\n\n\u201cWithout freedom of the press, there are no real democratic societies. Without freedom of the press, there is no freedom. The United Nations is working to support journalists and media workers everywhere.\u201d\n\nGuterres explained that the UN established a Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists 10 years ago to protect media workers and end impunity for crimes committed against them.\n\n\u201cOn World Press Freedom Day, we honour the essential work of the media in speaking truth to power, exposing lies, and building strong, resilient institutions and societies,\u201d he said.",

And by the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria, Libya and a handful of African countries again hobbled the projected oil production plan by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in April, failing to meet the quota allocated to them by the oil producers\u2019 group.\n\nA THISDAY analysis showed Monday that Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, Nigeria, drilled as much as 345,000 barrels per day less than its quota in the month under review.\n\nThe country produced 1 .39 million barrels per day as against its April allocation of 1.735 million bpd by OPEC.\n\nA survey carried out by Reuters for the month, indicated that the increase in OPEC\u2019s oil output in April undershot the rise planned under a deal with allies, as declines in Libya and Nigeria offset supply increases by Saudi Arabia and other top producers.\n\nOPEC pumped 28.58 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, up 40,000 bpd from the previous month and short of the 254,000 bpd increase called for under the supply deal.\n\nOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, are slowly relaxing 2020 output cuts as demand recovers from the pandemic. OPEC+ meets on Thursday and would be expected to confirm a previously agreed output hike despite the surge in oil prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe deal called for a 400,000 bpd increase in April from all OPEC+ members, of which about 254,000 bpd is shared by the 10 OPEC producers the agreement covers.\n\nOutput undershot the pledged hikes from October to March, with the exception of February as many producers lack the capacity to pump more crude following insufficient investment, a trend accelerated by the pandemic.\n\nAs a result, the 10 OPEC members are pumping far less than called for under the deal. OPEC compliance with pledged cuts was 164 per cent the survey found, as against 151 per cent in March.\n\nBut Nigeria\u2019s underperformance was one of the highest hitting over 500 per cent as against the 164 per cent overall.\n\nThe biggest drop in output was in Libya, which at one point in April was losing more than 550,000 bpd from blockades on fields and terminals. Libya is one of the OPEC members exempt from making output cuts.\n\nNigerian output posted a 40,000 bpd decline month-on-month, the survey found, with lower exports than in March. Force majeure remains in place on the Bonny Light export stream.\n\nThe outages limited the increase in OPEC\u2019s output as top producers followed through on the pledged hike in supply. The biggest rise in April of 100,000 bpd came from Saudi Arabia.\n\nIraq, which reported a month-on-month rise in exports, boosted output by 80,000 bpd. The United Arab Emirates followed through on its higher quota and added 40,000 bpd, while Kuwait\u2019s output edged up by 10,000 bpd.\n\nIran, also exempt from making output cuts, has been shipping more to China in 2022 and production rose in April, even as talks on reviving its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers have yet to reach a deal.\n\nProduction in Venezuela, another exempt producer, edged higher.

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that debt vulnerabilities remains elevated in Sub-Saharan Africa, with no fewer than 20 countries in the region either at high risk of debt distress or already in debt distress.\n\nThe Head of the Regional Studies Division in the African Department of IMF, Papa N\u2019Diaye who disclosed this in a new podcast released by the multilateral lender, said debt burden in the region was very heavy at a time when the social and development needs are very large.\n\nUnsustainable debt could lead to debt distress, where a country is unable to fulfill its financial obligations and resorts to debt restructuring.\n\nAlthough the IMF chief did not list the 20 African countries in debt distress or high risk of debt distress, the most recently published data indicated that eight countries in the world were in debt distress, 30 at high risk, 24 at moderate risk, and seven countries at low risk of debt distress.\n\nAfrican countries in high risk of debt distress were listed then as Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Zambia,\n\nOf the eight countries in debt distress globally, all but Grenada are from Africa. They include Chad, Congo Republic, Mozambique, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe IMF official said the debt service as a ratio to revenue has been increasing, adding that the debt burden is very heavy at a time when the social and development needs are very large.\n\nDespite its N39.556 trillion ($95.77 billion) public debt profile as at December 31, 2021, and over 80 per cent debt service-to-revenue ratio, Nigeria is neither classified as a nation in debt distress nor high risk of debt distress.\n\nN\u2019Diaye said: \u201cSo for countries in the region, the space to deal with the impact of the war in Ukraine is very limited, and there will be a need to make difficult choices. First, for us, the priority is really for countries to help the most vulnerable populations mainly through targeted transfers, if possible, especially those countries that have good social safety nets.\n\n\u201cThose that don\u2019t have those safety nets could resort to food subsidies and tax cuts. But these will definitely need to be contained both in scope and in time, given the limited fiscal space that countries have.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that Sub-Saharan African countries would need to try to create more room by improving domestic revenue mobilisation, a s well as making sure that they get the best bang for their bucks by increasing the efficiency of public spending.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSub-Saharan African economies were growing very strongly in 2021. We were expecting the region\u2019s average growth to come out at around 3.7 per cent for 2021. It turned out to be 4.5 per cent. And most of that positive surprise, or that momentum, started in the second half of the year.\n\n\u201cBut what the war in Ukraine has done, is to put a halt on that momentum. It led to a significant increase in commodity prices, more volatility in global financial markets.\u201d\n\nHe said inflation pressures have increased quite a lot, adding: \u201cWe are now seeing inflation in double digits for the region as a whole over, I think, 11.5 per cent within 2021. We are expecting it, if you look at the period average, to go towards 12.25 percentage points.\n\n\u201cAnd this is the first time since 2009 that we have this double- digit projection for inflation. And it reflects mainly higher food prices and higher energy prices.\n\n\u201cAnd as you can imagine, this will have a big impact on the most vulnerable in the region, increase poverty and potentially could raise social tensions. So for the policy makers in the region, like central bankers in particular, dealing with this inflation and pressure won\u2019t be easy because of the\u2026 also the impact that the policies could have on growth.\u201d\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, said rescuing the kidnapped passengers of the Kaduna-bound train that was recently attacked by terrorists was a delicate situation, which required wisdom, utmost caution, and proper handling. Buhari, however, assured the families of the victims that efforts were on-going to ensure the safe return of all those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe president claimed that the rescue had been made difficult because the terrorists were holding the captives close to places that could be targeted by security operatives in the event of a strong rescue operation, to deter such attack. He directed security agencies and the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to provide more regular and detailed information to the victims\u2019 families on their condition and efforts to save them.\n\nThe vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, in his own remarks, restated the country\u2019s trust in God, praying that the Almighty would fulfil the heart desires of all Muslims and every Nigerian.\n\nTerrorists had on March 28 attacked a Kaduna-bound train, killing no fewer than nine people, injuring several others, and abducting most of the passengers.\n\nThe president\u2019s assurances on efforts to secure the victims\u2019 release came on the heels of a recent lawsuit filed against him by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) over failure to protect the rights to life, security, and dignity of the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. SERAP also sued the president for his failure to secure the safe release of those held captive by the terrorists.\n\nBut speaking on Monday while receiving some residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Sallah homage at the State House, Abuja, Buhari said the government would explore every opportunity to rescue the captives alive and unhurt. He lamented that terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, did not respect the rules of engagement and could resort to harming hostages, when attacked.\n\nBuhari urged Nigerians to create a hostile environment for criminals hiding in communities, saying by sheltering criminals, they are endangering their own security and the security of their own communities. He said strong synergy between security agencies and communities would make a huge difference in efforts to defeat banditry and terrorism in the country.\n\nThe president allayed fears that bandits could grow to yet another big challenge, like the Boko Haram threat, assuring Nigerians that the administration would not allow such to happen, as the welfare of the people of Abuja and all Nigerians remained paramount.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cAs we celebrate this occasion with joy amidst friends and family members, we are fully conscious of the fact that many families in our country are in a state of fear and anxiety on account of the many captives held by terrorists against their will, including those taken away after the tragic bombing of the Abuja-Kaduna train.\n\n\u201cI have directed security agencies to ensure quick and safe recovery of all victims of kidnapping. I urge the railway management to immediately set up a situation room for the coordination of the rescue mission and for a minute-by-minute engagement with the families of the captives.\n\n\u201cThis should ease their pain and anxiety as we push the military to finding a safe return to their families. My aim is to see all those in captivity safely rescued. Let me assure Nigerians that the bandits are just pushing their luck, but this is only for a while before they are finally crushed.\n\n\u201cThey are using civilians as human shields, thereby making it difficult to confront them directly. Terrorists don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack. It\u2019s a delicate situation that requires wisdom, caution and also patience. Any rescue operation that results in the death of any hostage cannot be deemed a success.\n\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t want this kind of tragic outcome. It\u2019s a complex situation that demands proper handling. The primary objective of any rescue operation is to free the hostages safely, unharmed and alive. Let me make it clear, however, that defeating the terrorists and bandits requires more than weapons.\n\n\u201cWe also need human intelligence, which is necessary to frustrate terrorist plans. The people and community leaders should help our security officials with information about the activities or movements of criminal groups.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the president said his administration had allocated huge resources to improve the capacity of the security forces through timely and adequate supply of equipment and improving the welfare of personnel to boost their morale.\n\nHe said Abuja had witnessed remarkable improvement in terms of security, and claimed that in the past, terrorists had made it almost impossible to lead normal lives in the capital city.\n\nThe president said the completion of the Abuja light rail was one of the major projects embarked on by the administration for the inhabitants, as development of infrastructure remained essential to economic growth. He added that the government would continue to give serious attention to the town and link roads to other states as well as electricity and power.\n\nOsinbajo, at the occasion, thanked God for giving Buhari \u201call that you have required to tackle these challenges and for giving you the life and strength to tackle the challenges and to surmount the challenges.\u201d\n\nThe vice president noted that despite the challenges, Nigeria remained united. He stated, \u201cEvery generation of leaders is confronted with its own problems. There is no leader that is not confronted with his own or her own problems.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo expressed gratitude to the president, on behalf of the invited guests, for hosting the gathering.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "text": "Deposit money banks (DMBs and merchant banks borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Standing Lending Facility (SLF) dropped year-on-year (YoY) by 66 per cent to N1.49 trillion in first four months of 2022, from N4.44 trillion in the comparable period of 2021.\n\nFinancial institutions in Nigeria through the SLF borrow funds from the apex bank to meet their financial intermediation role.\n\nThe apex bank lends money to banks and merchant banks through the SLF at an interest rate of 100 basis points (bpts) above the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) of 11.50 per cent.\n\nThe trend between January and April 2022, as gathered from the CBN website revealed steady decline in bank and merchant banks\u2019 borrowings, driven by improvement in the level of liquidity in the interbank system.\n\nHowever, analysts have said the development was due to low rates on savings instruments, matured T-bills and bonds have not rolled over, resulting to more currency in circulation.\n\nAn analysis of the CBN financial data revealed that banks and other financial institutions in January 2022, borrowed N313.48 billion, which was a decline of 25.5 per cent from N426.7 billion borrowed in January 2021.\n\nIn February, the total amount borrowed by banks and merchant banks dropped further by 70 per cent to N186.48 billion from N621.7 billion in February 2021.\n\nThe trend continued in March 2022, as the CBN data revealed that N377 billion was borrowed by banks and merchant banks compared to N904.68 billion in March 2021. Also, the amount borrowed by banks and merchants\u2019 banks in April 2022 stood at N612.43 billion, a 75.4 per cent decline from N2.48 trillion reported by the CBN in April 2021.\n\nFinance experts attributed the development to improved business environment post Covid-19, stressing that this paved the way for banks and merchant banks to halt borrowing from the CBN this year.\n\nIn a chat with THISDAY, the Head, Financial Institutions\u2019 Ratings Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi said: \u201cThere are presently low rates, and remember that before 2019, T-bills were actually high and a lot of those instruments are maturing now, so there is money in circulation. And this has been the trend over the last couple of months.\u201d\n\nHe, however predicted that the CBN might soon put out measures to curb excess liquidity in circulation.\n\n\u201cOnce CBN feels the amount of liquidity in circulation is too much, they have different instruments they can use to mop it up. Also remember that as electioneering starts there would be more money in circulation and CBN can get more aggressive,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the Vice President, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori said uncertainty in the nation\u2019s economy forced banks and merchant banks to shun borrowing from CBN.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cBanks and merchant banks have excess liquidity and might not need to borrow from CBN. Besides, economic uncertainty has started to surface following the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, analysts at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye maintained that banks and merchant banks in first four months of 2021, borrowed enough funds from the CBN to meet their daily obligations.\n\nHe stressed that the nation\u2019s economy in 2021, had normalised, giving room for banks and merchant banks to reduce borrowing from the CBN in 2022.\n\nAdeyeye explained that banks and merchant banks are maintaining effective risk management in a move to cut down down non-performing Loan (NPL) in the financial sector.\n\nHe added that: \u201cBanks and merchant banks with increasing deposit from customers prefer to lend to CBN rather than their customers to maintain NPL below five per cent threshold demanded by CBN.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has issued a stern warning to those trying to do away with the zoning of the presidency in the country, saying any attempt to end zoning, as being insinuated in some northern quarters, would spell the end for Nigeria.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe leaders condemned a statement credited to the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Alhaji Ango Abdullahi, that rotation of the presidency between the north and south was \u201cdead and buried\u201d. They declared that another eight years of northern presidency, after President Muhammadu Buhari, was unacceptable.\n\nThe position of the leaders was contained in a joint statement on Monday by National Leader, Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and Chairman, SMBLF, Chief Edwin Clark; leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor; and National President, Middle Belt Forum, Pogu Bitrus. They said they were prepared for those attempting to upturn a practice \u2013 zoning \u2013 that had sustained the country.\n\nThe group warned that any attempt to kill and bury the age-long power rotation agreement between the north and south was tantamount to an attempt to kill and bury Nigeria.\n\nSMBLF warned that the move to tinker with the rotation of the presidency was inimical to national unity.\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt leaders also warned Abdullahi\u2019s NEF, and wondered if the northern body was now out to dissolve the country.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cSMBLF says it is rather unfortunate and absurd that Ango Abdullahi and his Northern Elders Forum would make such twaddle. Are they now ready to dissolve the country? What has happened that zoning, which has been a sine qua non in the nation\u2019s political progression, has now become a \u2018dead and buried\u2019 issue, in the irrational contemplations of Ango Abdullahi and his co-travellers?\n\n\u201cCould it be due to the incapacity, insipidity and disastrous performance of the Buhari administration or the narcissistic desire to perpetuate Hausa/Fulani hegemony? It has become necessary to underscore that Ango Abdullahi, with his established disposition of inconsistency and duplicity, is one of the people disturbing the polity and peace of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, this same Ango fumbled with the idea of a so-called consensus arrangement for northern presidential aspirants, he has not come out of it. Now he has sprung up with this reckless statement that zoning is dead and buried. Ango and his northern elders do not have the power to kill and bury zoning. If they want to kill and bury Nigeria, then we are ready for them.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesmen stated that the \u201chistory of zoning between the north and the south is well-known to everybody in this country and has been respected by all the major political parties in Nigeria.\u201d They recalled that all the ruling political parties from the Second Republic, such as the now defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN) and the current opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had adhered to the principle of zoning.\n\nThe elders also accused the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Adamu Abdullahi, of outright dishonesty and chicanery for saying APC had not decided the zoning of the presidency.\n\nAccording to SMBLF, \u201cMore so, earlier this year, the nation and global audience were told by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on a national/satellite television station, Channels Television, that zoning of the party and political elective offices exists in the APC.\n\n\u201cThe governor further hinted that all the positions earlier held by the north would be swapped with the south and vice versa. And this was inclusive of the presidency. That was the reason why only northerners vied for the national chairmanship of the party, which was zoned to the north and micro-zoned to the North-central, during the party\u2019s national convention in March this year.\n\n\u201cSadly, we are now being told by the newly \u2018imposed\u2019 national chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, that the APC has not decided on the zoning of the presidency. Such a statement at this stage, with about 30 days to the presidential primaries, amounts to outright dishonesty and chicanery. Who are they trying to deceive and who will allow them?\n\n\u201cIt becomes even more upsetting given the fact that the statement came from someone who himself emerged as National Chairman of the APC through the policy of rotation and zoning.\u201d\n\nThe southern leaders added, \u201cIt is haughty for anybody to say that this is the time to consider the quality of candidates. Where in Nigeria is deficient in quality candidates? Is it the south or the north? Everyone of the individuals from the south, who has indicated interest to contest for the presidency, both in APC and in PDP, is qualified to be President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey should stop their trickery. Enough is enough! We cannot have a northerner president for eight years and then welcome another northern president for another eight years or more. That is unacceptable to us. We, therefore, strongly caution all our governors, former governors, and top politicians not to accept the vice presidency nomination from any northern presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe urge the 17 southern governors, who unanimously declared that the presidency must come to the south in May last year, at Asaba, Delta State, to remain resolute. They have our absolute support for the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum and we stand firmly by them. This country belongs to all of us!\n\n\u201cLet everybody take this as a serious warning that the issue of zoning cannot be swept under the carpet; it cannot be dead and buried, if zoning is buried, Nigeria is, then, buried. And if they are thinking that this is a joke, let it be known that it is not. If we cannot abide by the established principle of rotation and zoning between the north and the south, then we should not continue with one Nigeria; we should go back to what we were as a people before the amalgamation of 1914.\n\n\u201cWe also earnestly call on the people of the Middle Belt Region and all minorities in Nigeria to wake up and work conscientiously with the southerners, if we do, the prospects will be pellucid. This was demonstrated at the National Conference of 2014 to the mortification of those who think this country belongs to them alone.\u201d",
